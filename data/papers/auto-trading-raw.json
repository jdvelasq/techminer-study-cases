    "Abstract": "Historical financial data are frequently used in technical analysis to identify patterns that can be exploited to achieve trading profits. Although technical analysis using a variety of technical indicators has proven to be useful for the prediction of price trends, it is difficult to use them to formulate trading rules that could be used in an automatic trading system due to the vague nature of the rules. Moreover, it is challenging to determine a specified combination of technical indicators that can be used to detect good trading points and trading rules since different stock may be affected by different set of factors. In this paper, we propose a novel trading point forecasting framework that incorporates a bicluster mining technique to discover significant trading patterns, a method to establish the fuzzy rule base, and a fuzzy inference system optimized for trading point prediction. The proposed method (called BM-FM) was tested on several historical stock datasets and the average performance was compared with the conventional buy-And-hold strategy and five previously reported intelligent trading systems. Experimental results demonstrated the superior performance of the proposed trading system. \u00a9 1993-2012 IEEE.",

    "Abstract": "Ever since the advent of the financial industry, experts have attempted to create systems to track and analyze trends in the stock market. These systems have not suitably predicted future trends, limiting the advice given to consumers. Expert opinions are subject to human error and personal bias, which can potentially lead to financial losses to the consumer. Thus, a system devoid of personal bias, providing an accurate prediction is highly beneficial to the consumer, the broker and the corporations involved in financial markets. Such a system, coupled with the automatic trading system, will optimize transactions leading to overall economic growth. The proposed system performs as a basic I/O system. The input is the historical market data, and the stock to be predicted. The output is the recommendation on whether to buy or sell the stock and supplemental graphs to aid the consumer. The key modules of the system are the capture, analysis, search and visualisation modules. These feed into the prediction module, which uses the concept of mining based Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to provide a reliable recommendation. Finally, all these modules represented to the consumer with webpage based convenient format via home screen. \u00a9 2019 IEEE.",

    "Abstract": "Trading strategies intended for high frequency trading in Forex markets are executed by cutting-edge automated trading systems. Such systems implement algorithmic trading strategies and are configured with predefined optimized parameters in order to generate entry and exit orders and execute trades on trading platforms. Three high-frequency automated trading systems were developed in the current research, using the MACD (oscillator), the SMA (moving average) and the PIVOT points (price crossover) technical indicators. The systems traded on hourly time frames, employing historical data of closing prices and the parameter optimization for each system was done using the d-Backtest PS method over weekly periods. With this work we intend to extend the methods of parameter selection for automated trading systems in high frequency trading. Through this research and the interpretation and evaluation of its results, we conclude that backtesting parameters\u2019 optimization, especially through the d-Backtest PS method, is much more profitable than the default values of the parameters and that the optimization of parameters yields the highest profits through the implementation of restrictive relationships among them. It is also observed that the selection of the most profitable parameters of a trading system can be unrestricted, rendering the validation of the minor divergence occurring among slightly varying prices redundant. Meanwhile, other conclusions that can be drawn are that the most profitable classification system employed by the d-Backtest PS method is calibrated by means of two validation periods and that the most efficient profitability ratio between historical data period and validation period is 6:1 (in- and out-of-the-sample ratio). \u00a9 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",

    "Abstract": "The aim of this study is to predict automatic trading decisions in stock markets. Comprehensive features (CF) for predicting future trend are very difficult to generate in a complex environment, especially in stock markets. According to related work, the relevant stock information can help investors formulate objects that may result in better profits. With this in mind, we present a framework of an intelligent stock trading system using comprehensive features (ISTSCF) to predict future stock trading decisions. The ISTSCF consists of stock information extraction, prediction model learning and stock trading decision. We apply three different methods to generate comprehensive features, including sentiment analysis (SA) that provides sensitive market events from stock news articles for sentiment indices (SI), technical analysis (TA) that yields effective trading rules based on trading information on the stock exchange for technical indices (TI), as well as the trend-based segmentation method (TBSM) that raises trading decisions from stock price for trading signals (TS). Experiments on the Taiwan stock market show that the results of employing comprehensive features are significantly better than traditional methods using numeric features alone (without textual sentiment features). \u00a9 2014 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "In the last few years, the financial industry has witnessed a growing demand for an integrated multi-asset, multi-strategy trading system that allows traders to simultaneously trade different types of assets, and provides real-time risk assessments, status, and performance of the diversified portfolio. However, many factors contribute to the complexity of developing such integrated decision-making systems. Some of these factors include: the inherent diversity of financial assets, the heterogeneity of trading and risk assessment strategies, and the highly dynamic nature of financial markets. Moreover, the large volume of data to be analyzed severely affects the system's ability to make timely decisions, especially, for high-frequency trading. This paper proposes a novel Holonic Intelligent Multi-Agent Algorithmic Trading System (HIMAATS) to address the software functional requirements (multi-asset, multi-strategy, real-time risk assessment, etc.), and non-functional requirements (autonomy, high-throughput, low-latency, modularity, scalability, etc.).",

    "Abstract": "Algorithmic trading systems are data intensive software systems that employ precise set of rules and mathematical models to analyze the financial data/news, generate buy/sell signals when trading opportunities are discovered, decide on quantities, and finally, submit orders to one or more exchanges. The development of a multi-asset, multi-strategy algorithmic trading system is a complex and multidimensional problem. Therefore, it is imperative that careful decisions are made regarding the best suited system architecture that meets the software functional requirements (multi-asset, multi-strategy, real-time risk assessment, etc.), and non-functional requirements (autonomy, high-throughput, low-latency, modularity, scalability, etc.). This paper discusses architecture paradigms that can serve as candidates for consideration to design a multi-asset, multi-strategy algorithmic trading system. The paper highlights the pros and cons of each one of these architecture paradigms and provides a body of argument that favours the holonic paradigm as the most suitable one.",

    "Abstract": "This work proposes a new automated trading system (ATS) architecture that supports multiple strategies for multiple market conditions through hierarchical trading signals generation employing h-signals, which are trading signals that are generated using other trading signals. The central idea of the proposed system architecture is to decompose the trading problem into a set of tasks handled by distributed autonomous agents under a minimal central coordination. We implemented the proposed ATS using a software architecture that employed a publish/subscribe communication model. In the current stage of development, we are able to run our ATS in back-test mode with moving-average crossover strategies on minute-by-minute market databases. We achieved very satisfactory performance results, processing 306.791 database rows representing more than two years of data in only 47 seconds. \u00a9 2013 ACM.",

    "Abstract": "For the better part of the last four decades academic research has focused on stock return predictability explained by asset pricing models. Financial economists approach finance theory by focusing on whether to reject a pricing model based on hypothesis tests. However, this approach often fails to capture aspects of the model and latent information in the data that could be potentially useful to the investor. Owing to these limitations, investors have increasingly turned to high-frequency trading as a means of achieving risk-mitigated wealth appreciation. High frequency trading is a strategy that relies on professional proprietary formula-driven trading algorithms to execute millisecond trades using high-speed computers that are placed near or in the proximity of the exchanges to reduce order latency time. The contemporary impact of this new approach has increased the speed and complexity of trading, and has had an impact on market liquidity and transparency. In turn, this has attracted the attention of regulators who are \"Clamping Down on Rapid Trades in the Stock Market\" [3] and the risk of such trades to create volatility by flooding the market with orders before canceling these same orders in fractions of seconds. Facing the possibility of regulatory oversight, many highfrequency automated traders are now turning to the alternative of near high-frequency trading. Instead of focusing on strategies to implement strategic runs in the millisecondenvironment, using the highest resolution data available, near high-frequency trading solves complex econometric models on an instrument by instrument basis to predict the profitability of a future trade. In this paper we present a theory of stochastic price formation to form a behavioral near high frequency automated trading system. The new system is actuated by a combining dual radial basis function artificial neural networks and two fundamental trading metrics. Additionally, because the trading signals are generated by cognitive models, the research calibrates a nonparametric behavioral production function to estimate the quasi elasticity coefficients of a four factor model. \u00a9 2013 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Firms pay a premium to have their own high-speed computers sitting as close as possible to the trading venues in colocation facilities to minimize the communications time putting those using the standard consolidated feed, which first combines the many different data streams provided by exchanges before the updates are relayed, at a disadvantage. Colocation and fast parallel processing hardware lets the HFT (high-frequency trading) systems act rapidly on any incoming news of trades. Across the Atlantic, MEPs in the European Parliament voted for a bill that could curb the more abusive activities of algorithmic trading.

    "Abstract": "This chapter proposes a hybrid high-frequency trading application based on a Type-2 Fuzzy Logic approach combined with Hilbert transforms for the detection of periodicities in high-frequency FX data. Most trading systems have concentrated on using common analytic waveforms and have not taken into consideration phasors and complex variables. The Hilbert transform, often employed to convert signal variables in analytic waveforms to complex variables, will be used for the measurement of market cycles, rather than measurement of market trends. The main objective is to investigate how the periods of the dominant cycle in a cycle mode can be quantified in order to create an amplitude compensation of the In-Phase and Quadrature components, alongside methods of smoothing and de-trending the analytic signal. The subsequent output can be defuzzified using Type 2 Fuzzy-Logic techniques, which will in turn refine the implementation of trading strategies. Type-2 Fuzzy Logic systems are becoming more popular as they account for uncertainties that are not captured within a Type-1 Fuzzy Logic system. These Type-2 systems outperform traditional Fuzzy Logic systems in forecasting problems since they can account for more variables in a more efficient way. \u00a9 2013 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Historical data has been used to implement the various technical indicators and also to train the Neural Network that predicts movement for intra-day Nifty. Further, Sentiment Analysis techniques are applied to popular blog articles written by domain experts and to user comments to find sentiment orientation, so that analysis can be further improved and better prediction accuracy can be achieved. The system makes a prediction for every trading day with these methods to forecast if next day will be a positive day or negative. Further, buy and sell calls for intra-day trading are also decided by the system thus achieving full automation in stock trading. \u00a9 2013 IEEE.",

    "Abstract": "The rapid development of information technology has changed the dynamics of financial markets. The main purpose of this study is laid on examining the role of IT based stock trading on financial market efficiency. This research specifically focused on algorithmic trading. Algorithmic trading enables investors to trade stocks through a computer program without the need for human interventions. Based on an empirical analysis of the Korean stock market, this study discovered the positive impact of algorithmic trading on stock market efficiency at three-fold. First, the study results indicate that algorithmic trading contributes to the reduction in asymmetric volatility, which causes inefficiency of information in a stock market. Second, an algorithmic trading also increases the operation efficiency of a stock market. Arbitrage trading contributes on the equilibrium between the spot market and futures market as well as on the price discovery. Third, algorithmic trading provides liquidity for market participants contributing to friction free transactions. The research results indicate that stock exchanges based on electronic communications networks (ECNs) without human intervention could augment a financial market quality by increasing trading share volumes and market efficiency so that it can eventually contribute to the welfare of market investors. \u00a9 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.",

    "Abstract": "In this paper, we consider using profit/loss histories of multiple automated trading systems (ATSs) as N input variables in portfolio management. By means of multivariate statistical analysis and simulation studies, we analyze the influences of sample size (L) and input dimensionality on the accuracy of determining the portfolio weights. We find that degradation in portfolio performance due to inexact estimation of N means and N(N - 1)/2 correlations is proportional to N/L; however, estimation of N variances does not worsen the result. To reduce unhelpful sample size/dimensionality effects, we perform a clustering of N time series and split them into a small number of blocks. Each block is composed of mutually correlated ATSs. It generates an expert trading agent based on a nontrainable 1/ N portfolio rule. To increase the diversity of the expert agents, we use training sets of different lengths for clustering. In the output of the portfolio management system, the regularized mean-variance framework-based fusion agent is developed in each walk-forward step of an out-of-sample portfolio validation experiment. Experiments with the real financial data (2003-2012) confirm the effectiveness of the suggested approach. \u00a9 2013 IEEE.",

    "Abstract": "In many investment banks and major fund-management companies, automated \"robot\" trading systems now do work that 20 years ago would have required large numbers of human traders to perform: the rise of robot traders is a major success-story for artificial intelligence (AI) research. Although the technical details of currently profitable automated trading systems are closely guarded commercial secrets, the rise of robot trading can be traced back to a sequence of key AI research papers. Each of these key papers relied on minimal abstract simulation models of real financial markets: the simulators provide test-beds for trials in which the performance of different trading strategies could be evaluated and compared. Recent studies have revisited these seminal results, using more realistic simulations of contemporary financial markets, and have cast major doubts on core conclusions drawn in the original publications. Therefore, it seems reasonable to argue that present-day simulation methods are exposing significant problems in past research on automated trading. This position paper presents no new empirical results but instead presents a review of key past papers and an argument, a manifesto, for establishing a shared market-simulator test-bed that adequately reflects current real-world financial markets, for use in future evaluation and comparison of trading strategies. \u00a9 Modeling and Applied Simulation, MAS 2019.All Rights Reserved.",

    "Abstract": "This chapter provides an overview of market microstructure research. Market microstructure research focuses on how, when, where, and why financial instruments transact in the marketplace. We trace the evolution of the equity markets from stocks trading on the floor of the NYSE exchange via specialists (for listed stocks) and via NASDAQ market makers (for OTC stocks) to a current environment where stocks trade on numerous exchanges, and with only limited intervention from specialists and market makers, and where buyers and sellers are matched via electronic trading algorithms. We evaluate the pros and cons of this new environment and investigate what it means to traders now executing orders via algorithms. We investigate the different exchanges (NYSE, AMEX, ARCA, and NASDAQ), alternative venues (such as Bats and Edge), and dark pools (independent dark pool crosses, broker dealer crossing venues, and enhanced liquidity providers). Additionally, we provide an overview of the new pricing structures in the market including liquidity rebates, maker-taker pricing models, and the effect of high frequency and algorithmic trading on the price discovery process. The chapter continues with an investigation into intraday trading patterns (volumes, volatility, and spreads), and concludes with an investigation into the May 2010 flash crash. \u00a9 2014 Elsevier Inc.

    "Abstract": "Recurrent reinforcement learning (RRL), a machine learning technique, is very successful in training high frequency trading systems. When trading analysis of RRL is done with lower frequency financial data, e.g. daily stock prices, the decrease of autocorrelation in prices may lead to a decrease in trading profit. In this paper, we propose a RRL trading system which utilizes the price information, jointly with the indicators from technical analysis, fundamental analysis and econometric analysis, to produce long/short signals for daily trading. In the proposed trading system, we use a genetic algorithm as a pre-screening tool to search suitable indicators for RRL trading. Moreover, we modify the original RRL parameter update scheme in the literature for out-of-sample trading. Empirical studies are conducted based on data sets of 238 S&P stocks. It is found that the trading performance concerning the out-of-sample daily Sharpe ratios turns better: the number of companies with a positive and significant Sharpe ratio increases after feeding the selected indicators jointly with prices information into the RRL system.",

    "Abstract": "We develop market timing strategies and trading systems to test the intra-day predictive power of Japanese candlesticks at the 5-minute interval on the 30 constituents of the DJIA index. Around a third of the candlestick rules outperform the buy-and-hold strategy at the conservative Bonferroni level. After adjusting for trading costs, however, just a few rules remain profitable. When we correct for data snooping by applying the SSPA test on double-or-out market timing strategies, no single candlestick rule beats the buy-and-hold strategy after transaction costs. We also design fully automated trading systems by combining the best-performing candlestick rules. No evidence of out-performance is found after transaction costs. Although Japanese candlesticks can somewhat predict intra-day returns on large US caps, we show that such predictive power is too limited for active portfolio management to outperform the buy-and-hold strategy when luck, risk, and trading costs are correctly measured. \u00a9 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",

    "Abstract": "This study explores the dynamics of the price discovery process between the regular and mini index futures traded on the Taiwan Futures Exchange (TAIFEX). In contrast to the US futures market, the TAIFEX operates under an automated electronic trading system for both types of contracts. After controlling for the differences in the trading mechanisms, we demonstrate that mini index futures make a greater contribution than regular index futures to the price discovery process within the TAIFEX. Regression analyses show that both relative liquidity and relative changes in liquidity between regular and mini index futures contribute to the price discovery of the mini index futures. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Johnson, Zhao, Hunsader, Meng, Ravindar, Carran, and Tivnan (2012) recently suggested the existence of a phase transition in the dynamics of financial markets in which there is free interaction between human traders and algorithmic trading systems ('robots'). Above a particular time-threshold, humans and robots trade with one another; below the threshold all transactions are robot-to-robot. We refer to this abrupt system transition as the 'robot phase transition'. Here, we conduct controlled experiments where human traders interact with 'robot' trading agents in minimal models of electronic financial markets to see if correlates of the two regimes suggested by Johnson et al. (2012) occur in such laboratory conditions. Our results indicate that when trading robots act on a super-human timescale, the market starts to fragment, with statistically lower human-robot interactions than we would expect from a fully mixed market. We tentatively conclude that this is the first empirical evidence for the robot phase transition occurring under controlled experimental conditions.",

    "Abstract": "Automated trading systems in the global financial markets are increasingly being deployed to do jobs previously done by skilled human traders: very often a human trader in the markets simply cannot tell whether the counter-party to a trade is another human, or a machine. Clearly, automated trading systems can easily be considered as \"intelligent\" software agents. In this paper we report on experiments with software trader-agents running the well-known \"AA\" and \"ZIP\" strategies, often used as reference benchmarks in previously published studies; here we suggest disambiguated standard implementations of these algorithms. Then, using Exchange Portal (ExPo), an open-source financial exchange simulation platform designed for real-time behavioural economic experiments involving human traders and/or trader-agents, we explore the impact of introducing a new method for assignment adaptation in ZIP. Results show that markets containing only assignment-adaptive (ASAD) agents equilibrate more quickly after market shocks than markets containing only \"standard\" ZIP agents. However, perhaps counter-intuitively, in mixed heterogeneous populations of ASAD agents and ZIP agents, ZIP agents outperform ASAD agents. Evidence suggests that the behaviour of ASAD agents act as a new signal in the market that ZIP agents then use to beneficially alter their own behaviour, to the detriment of the ASAD agents themselves.",

Complex Event Processing over dynamic data management systems and algorithmic trading systems poses huge challenges with regard to efficient, scalable execution as well as expressive models and languages that account for the dynamics in long-running queries. In this paper we discuss the characteristics that a data event processing service should have in order to support in the best way the complex event pattern detection functionality, and present an assessment of a number of technologies that can be used to dynamic data.

    "Abstract": "Modern companies must be able to react in a timely way to changes in production and financial information since quick responses provide advantages against competition. As a matter of example, in automated trading systems a delay of 1 ms may be worth $1M. In addition, nowadays business decisions are made on the basis of increasing volumes of information, complicating the adoption of decisions on time. These requirements are common to those found in other real-time application domains. Consequently, adapting certain tools used in such domains may be a solution for business applications too. This paper draws several scenarios where middleware based solutions are justified, with particular insight on real-time behavior and control of QoS (Quality of Service) needs. More specifically, we provide certain guidelines to use OMG DDS (Data Distribution Service) as communications backbone in soft real-time business applications. DDS is a recent publish/subscribe middleware specification which provides mechanisms aimed at easing the creation of complex distributed applications such as those allowing the definition of content filters or tuning QoS parameters. Unfortunately, DDS is a complex technology so the programmers of business applications may benefit from certain guidelines that help them in the identification of the topics as well as the values for the QoS parameters provided by DDS. \u00a9 2012 AISTI.",

The design of profitable automatic trading systems is becoming a challenging process. This requires a strong synergy of economists and computer scientists. Our aim is to provide an optimization framework for trading systems that starting from a generic strategy, enhances its performances by exploiting mathematical constraints. Moreover, the growth of new markets requires suitable solutions integrating computer science tools with economic analysis. In this work, we mainly refer to an emerging market known as Binary Options. Starting from basic strategies used every day in the stock markets by professional traders, we show how optimization issues enhance the outcoming performances.

    "Abstract": "Trend following (TF) is trading philosophy by which buying/selling decisions are made solely according to the observed market trend. For many years, many manifestations of TF such as a software program called Turtle Trader, for example, emerged in the industry. Surprisingly little has been studied in academic research about its algorithms and applications. Unlike financial forecasting, TF does not predict any market movement; instead it identifies a trend at early time of the day, and trades automatically afterwards by a pre-defined strategy regardless of the moving market directions during run time. Trend following trading has been popular among speculators. However it remains as a trading method where human judgment is applied in setting the rules (aka the strategy) manually. Subsequently the TF strategy is executed in pure objective operational manner. Finding the correct strategy at the beginning is crucial in TF. This usually involves human intervention in first identifying a trend, and configuring when to place an order and close it out, when certain conditions are met. In this paper, we evaluated and compared a collection of TF algorithms that can be programmed in a computer system for automated trading. In particular, a new version of TF called trend recalling model is presented. It works by partially matching the current market trend with one of the proven successful patterns from the past. Our experiments based on real stock market data show that this method has an edge over the other trend following methods in profitability. The results show that TF however is still limited by market fluctuation (volatility), and the ability to identify trend signal. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

    "Abstract": "We employ virtual generalized random access memory weightless neural networks, VG-RAM WNN, for predicting future stock returns. We evaluated our VG-RAM WNN stock predictor architecture in predicting future weekly returns of the Brazilian stock market and obtained the same error levels and properties of baseline autoregressive neural network predictors; however, our VG-RAM WNN predictor runs 5000 times faster than autoregressive neural network predictors. This allowed us to employ VG-RAM WNN predictors to build a high frequency trading system able to achieve a monthly return of approximately 35% in the Brazilian stock market.

    "Abstract": "Research and development of automatic trading systems are becoming more frequent, as they can reach a high potential for predicting market movements. The use of these systems allows to manage a huge amount of data related to the factors that affect investment performance (macroeconomic variables, company information, industry indicators, market variables, etc.), while avoiding psychological reactions of traders when investing in financial markets.Movements in stock markets are continuous throughout each day, which requires trading systems must be supported by more powerful engines, since the amount of data to process grows, while the response time required to support operations is shortened. In this chapter we present two parallel implementations of a GA based trading system. The first uses a Grid Volunteer System based on BOINC and the second one takes advantage of a Graphic Processing Unit implementation. \u00a9 2012 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.",

    "Abstract": "In this article we present a new method for the analysis of dependencies in case of multivariate time series. In this approach, we assume that the set of time series representing the various financial instruments creates a multidimensional variable. Such a multidimensional variable is decomposed into independent components which enable to analyze the morphology of given financial instruments and to identify the hidden interdependencies. We propose a new multiplicative version of the Natural Gradient ICA algorithm that could be used in automated trading systems or modeling environments. The presented method is tested on real stock markets data. \u00a9 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",

    "Abstract": "Algorithmic trading has been blamed for an increasing level of volatility in a number of financial markets. Adoption and deployment of algorithmic trading systems has increased and this is likely to continue, as regulation, competition and innovation drive the development of advanced technological tools. Expert and intelligent systems provide the mechanics for both reacting to and affecting a financial market that is now significantly faster and operating across multiple time zones and markets. Surprisingly, much of this innovation has escaped discussion within the Information Systems research community. This paper explores this growing arena by engaging with senior practitioners in the industry and using interviews and grounded theory (GT) analysis to uncover their adoption concerns. The paper generalises these issues within a framework and guidelines aimed at supporting algorithmic trading system adoption, deployment and development. \u00a9 2012 IEEE.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose-The purpose of this study is to discover and model the asymmetry in the price volatility of financial markets, in particular the foreign exchange markets as the first underlying applications. Design/methodology/approach-The volatility of the financial market price is usually defined with the standard deviation or variance of the price or price returns. This standard definition of volatility is split into the upper part and the lower one, which are termed here as Yang volatility and Yin volatility. However, the definition of yin-yang volatility depends on the scale of the time, thus the notion of scale space of price-time is also introduced. Findings-It turns out that the duality of yin-yang volatility expresses not only the asymmetry of price volatility, but also the information about the trend. The yin-yang volatilities in the scale space of price-time provide a complete representation of the information about the multi-level trends and asymmetric volatilities. Such a representation is useful for designing strategies in market risk management and technical trading. A trading robot (a complete automated trading system) was developed using yin-yang volatility, its performance is shown to be non-trivial. The notion and model of yin-yang volatility has opened up new possibilities to rewrite the option pricing formulas, the GARCH models, as well as to develop new comprehensive models for foreign exchange markets. Research limitations/implications-The asymmetry of price volatility and the magnitude of volatility in the scale space of price-time has yet to be united in a more coherent model. Practical implications-The new model of yin-yang volatility and scale space of price-time provides a new theoretical structure for financial market risk. It is likely to enable a new generation of core technologies for market risk management and technical trading strategies. Originality/value-This work is original. The new notion and model of yin-yang volatility in scale space of price-time has cracked up the core structure of the financial market risk. It is likely to open up new possibilities such as: A new portfolio theory with a new objective function to minimize the sum of the absolute yin-volatilities of the asset returns, a new option pricing theory using yin-yang volatility to replace the symmetric volatility, a new GARCH model aiming to model the dynamics of yin-yang volatility instead of the symmetric volatility, new technical trading strategies as are shown in the paper. \u00a9 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",

    "Abstract": "Technological innovations such as high frequency trading systems (HFT) and algorithmic trading systems have changed financial markets. We discuss technological and economic aspects of HFT and find that HFT have a major impact on all aspects of the internal market structure of exchanges. We use market quality measures on a unique dataset provided by NASDAQ in order to analyze the contribution of HFT to market quality. The empirical results are discussed in the context of external and internal factors of market quality. Our results indicate considerable differences in trading strategies: HFT engage in market making strategies and provide liquidity when it is expensive and demand liquidity when it is cheap. Their trades are more informed than non-HFT trades for stocks with a high market capitalization and therefore make prices more informative, but less informed across the entire sample.",

    "Abstract": "Stock market prediction and trading has attracted the effort of many researchers in several scientific areas because it is a challenging task due to the high complexity of the market. More investors put their effort to the development of a systematic approach, i.e., the so called \"Trading System (TS)\" for stocks pricing and trend prediction. The introduction of the Trading On-Line (TOL) has significantly improved the overall number of daily transactions on the stock market with the consequent increasing of the market complexity and liquidity. One of the most main consequence of the TOL is the \"automatic trading\", i.e., an ad-hoc algorithmic robot able to automatically analyze a lot of financial data with target to open/close several trading operations in such reduced time for increasing the profitability of the trading system. When the number of such automatic operations increase significantly, the trading approach is known as High Frequency Trading (HFT). In this context, recently, the usage of machine learning has improved the robustness of the trading systems including HFT sector. The authors propose an innovative approach based on usage of ad-hoc machine learning approach, starting from historical data analysis, is able to perform careful stock price prediction. The stock price prediction accuracy is further improved by using adaptive correction based on the hypothesis that stock price formation is regulated by Markov stochastic propriety. The validation results applied to such shares and financial instruments confirms the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed automatic trading algorithm. \u00a9 2019 by the authors.",

We propose an FPGA based accelerator for High Frequency Trading that is able to decrease latency by an order of magnitude and increase the data rate by the same rate compared to software based CPU approaches. In particular, we focus on the acceleration of FAST, the most commonly used protocol for distributing pricing information of stock and options over the network. As FPGAs are hard to program, we present a novel Domain Specific Language that enables our engine to be programmed via software. The code is compiled by our own compiler into binary microcode that is then executed on a microcode engine.

    "Abstract": "This study sheds light on the resiliency of competing electronic order-driven markets by investigating the time path of liquidity after a large endogenous shock by means of an intra-day event study. We confirm earlier results that large trades, which qualify as shocks for the purpose of this analysis, are timed as they occur when liquidity in the market is extraordinarily high. Moreover, we find that adverse liquidity effects peak within the first-minute interval after a large trade. In contrast to previous researchers' results, we discover that liquidity recovers not within minutes, but within a few seconds so that the adverse effect already diminishes significantly towards the end of the first post-event minute. Three minutes later, basically no residue from the liquidity shock remains observable. We attribute this finding to the fact that temporary order-book imbalances are immediately detected by algorithmic trading engines and high-frequency traders whose order management (IT-) systems are continuously eagle-eying the stock markets for such opportunities. Interestingly, our results differ depending on the market under scrutiny.",

    "Abstract": "Automatizing commodities' price negotiation was hard to achieve in practice, mainly because of logistical complications. The purpose of our work is to show that it is possible to automatize thoroughly commodities' trading in the futures market by replacing human traders with artificial agents. As a starting step, we designed a market institution, called producer-consumer, where only an automated seller and an automated buyer can trade on behalf of the producer and consumer, respectively. The producer and consumer periodically feed their trading agents with supply and demand (S&D) forecasts. We suggested a parameterizable trading strategy, called bands and frequencies, for the agents. To measure the overall efficiency of this trading system in terms of price stability and liquidity, we made some hypotheses on the benchmark price curve and its linkages to S&D curves and other relevant market variables. Then we proposed analytical tools to measure strategy performance. Finally, we conducted some computer simulations to prove the workability of this approach. \u00a9 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

    "Abstract": "A number of researchers have attempted to take successful GP trading systems and make them even better through the use of filters. We investigate the use of a linear genetic programming (LGP) system that combines GP signals provided over multiple intraday time frames to produce one trading action. Four combinations of time frames stretching further into the past are examined. Two different decision mechanisms for evaluating the overall signal given the GP signals over all time frames are also examined, one based on majority vote and another based on temporal proximity to the buying decision. Results indicated that majority vote outperformed emphasis on proximity of time frames to the current trading decision. Analyses also indicated that longer time frame combinations were more conservative and outperformed shorter combinations for both overall upward and downward price trends. Copyright 2011 ACM.",

    "Abstract": "Automated trading systems for financial markets can use data mining techniques for future price movement prediction. However, classifier accuracy is only one important component in such a system: the other is a decision procedure utilizing the prediction in order to be long, short or out of the market. In this paper, we investigate the use of technical indicators as a means of deciding when to trade in the direction of a classifier's prediction. We compare this \"hybrid\" technical/data stream mining-based system with a naive system that always trades in the direction of predicted price movement. We are able to show via evaluations across five financial market datasets that our novel hybrid technique frequently outperforms the naive system. To strengthen our conclusions, we also include in our evaluation several \"simple\" trading strategies without any data mining component that provide a much stronger baseline for comparison than traditional buy-and-hold or sell-and-hold strategies. \u00a9 2011 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",

    "Abstract": "In 2001, a team of researchers at IBM published a paper in IJCAI which reported on the first experiments that systematically studied the interactions of human traders and software-agent traders in electronic marketplaces running the continuous double auction (CDA) mechanism. IBM found that two software-agent strategies, known as GD and ZIP, consistently outperformed human traders. IBM 's results received international press coverage, probably because the CDA is the mechanism that is used in the main electronic trading systems that make up the global financial markets. In 2002, Tesauro & Bredin published details of an extension to GD, which they named GDX, for which they wrote: \"We suggest that this algorithm may offer the best performance of any published CDA bidding strategy\". To the best of our knowledge, GDX has never been tested against human traders under experimental conditions. In this paper, we report on the first such test: we present detailed analysis of the results from our own replications of IBM's human vs. ZIP experiments and from our world-first experiments that test humans vs. GDX. Our overall findings are that, both when competing against ZIP in pure agent vs. agent experiments and when competing against human traders, GDX's performance is significantly better than the performance of ZIP.",

    "Abstract": "Based on the principles of technical analysis, this paper proposes an artificial intelligence model, which employs the Adaptive Network Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) supplemented by the use of reinforcement learning (RL) as a non-arbitrage algorithmic trading system. The novel intelligent trading system is capable of identifying a change in a primary trend for trading and investment decisions. It dynamically determines the periods for momentum and moving averages using the RL paradigm and also appropriately shifting the cycle using ANFIS-RL to address the delay in the predicted cycle. This is used as a proxy to determine the best point in time to go LONG and visa versa for SHORT. When this is coupled with a group of stocks, we derive a simple form of \"riding the cycles - waves\". These are the derived features of the underlying stock movement. It provides a learning framework to trade on cycles. Initial experimental results are encouraging. Firstly, the proposed framework is able to outperform DENFIS and RSPOP in terms of true error and correlation. Secondly, based on the test trading with five US stocks, the proposed trading system is able to beat the market by about 50 percentage points over a period of 13 years. \u00a9 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

    "Abstract": "Financial volatility refers to the intensity of the fluctuations in the expected return on an investment or the pricing of a financial asset due to market uncertainties. Hence, volatility modeling and forecasting is imperative to financial market investors, as such projections allow the investors to adjust their trading strategies in anticipation of the impending financial market movements. Following this, financial volatility trading is the capitalization of the uncertainties of the financial markets to realize investment profits in times of rising, falling and side-way market conditions. In this paper, an intelligent straddle trading system (framework) that consists of a volatility projection module (VPM) and a trade decision module (TDM) is proposed for financial volatility trading via the buying and selling of option straddles to help a human trader capitalizes on the underlying uncertainties of the Hong Kong stock market. Three different measures, namely: (1) the historical volatility (HV), (2) implied volatility (IV) and (3) model-based volatility (MV) of the Hang Seng Index (HSI) are employed to quantify the implicit volatility of the Hong Kong stock market. The TDM of the proposed straddle trading system combines the respective volatility measures with the well-established moving-averages convergence/divergence (MACD) principle to recommend trading actions to a human trader dealing in HSI straddles. However, the inherent limitation of the MACD trading rule is that it generates time-delayed trading signals due to the use of moving averages, which are essentially lagging trend indicators. This drawback is intuitively addressed in the proposed straddle trading system by applying the VPM to compute future projections of the volatility measures of the HSI prior to the activation of the TDM. The VPM is realized by a self-organising neural-fuzzy semantic network named the evolving fuzzy semantic memory (eFSM) model. As compared to existing statistical and computational intelligence based modeling techniques currently employed for financial volatility modeling and forecasting, eFSM possesses several desirable attributes such as: (1) an evolvable knowledge base to continuously address the non-stationary characteristics of the Hong Kong stock market; (2) highly formalized human-like information computations; and (3) a transparent structure that can be interpreted via a set of linguistic IF-THEN semantic fuzzy rules. These qualities provide added credence to the computed HSI volatility projections. The volatility modeling and forecasting performances of the eFSM, when benchmarked to several established modeling techniques, as well as the observed trading returns of the proposed straddle trading system, are encouraging. \u00a9 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Owing to the high risk associated with option trading, investment on options is a knowledge-intensive industry. This study develops a novel decision support system for option trading. In the first stage, independent component analysis (ICA) is employed to uncover the independent hidden forces of the stock market that drive the price movement of an option. In the second stage, a dynamic kernel predictors are constructed for trading decisions. Comparing with convectional feature extractions and pure regression models, the performance improvement of the new method is significant and robust. The cumulated trading profits are substantialy increased.

    "Abstract": "Despite the long run of the Efficient Market Hypothesis, recent empirical evidences are raising questions about the effectiveness of such conceptual framework. Several studies seems to support the idea that the financial markets in general and the foreign exchanges ones in particular are exhibiting different forms of informational inefficiency, partial rational decision taken processes and hyper reactivity of the market participants behavior. Thus if the financial instruments prices cannot be completely accurate described as random walk processes, there is place for the involvement of different systematic structured technical analysis rules. The objective of this paper is to provide a synthetic test for the partial inefficiency of the USD / CAD exchange market as is this reveal by the employment of high frequency one minute data and also to estimate the \"excess\" returns generated by an adaptive MESA Moving Average based trading strategy. The paper combines the appliance of an Brock-Dechert-Scheinkman portmanteau test in order to evaluate the time dependence in the exchange rate series with such a trading rule and concludes that markets 'informational imperfections can be exploited by the usage of technical analysis indicators especially if these indicators are constructed in an adaptive manner. Such output opens large possibility for the construction and implementation of automatic trading systems based on the usage of large databases of high frequency markets data.",

    "Abstract": "This paper develops a matrix-variate adaptive Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methodology for Bayesian Cointegrated Vector Auto Regressions (CVAR). We replace the popular approach to sampling Bayesian CVAR models, involving griddy Gibbs, with an automated efficient alternative, based on the Adaptive Metropolis algorithm of Roberts and Rosenthal (2009). Developing the adaptive MCMC framework for Bayesian CVAR models allows for efficient estimation of posterior parameters in significantly higher dimensional CVAR series than previously possible with existing griddy Gibbs samplers. For a n-dimensional CVAR series, the matrix-variate posterior is in dimension 3n2 + n, with significant correlation present between the blocks of matrix random variables. Hence, utilizing a griddy Gibbs sampler for large n becomes computationally impractical as it involves approximating an n\u00d7n full conditional posterior using a spline over a high dimensional n\u00d7n grid. The adaptive MCMC approach is demonstrated to be ideally suited to learning on-line a proposal to reflect the posterior correlation structure, therefore improving the computational efficiency of the sampler. We also treat the rank of the CVAR model as a random variable and perform joint inference on the rank and model parameters. This is achieved with a Bayesian posterior distribution defined over both the rank and the CVAR model parameters, and inference is made via Bayes Factor analysis of rank. Practically the adaptive sampler also aids in the development of automated Bayesian cointegration models for algorithmic trading systems considering instruments made up of several assets, such as currency baskets. Previously the literature on financial applications of CVAR trading models typically only considers pairs trading (n=2) due to the computational cost of the griddy Gibbs. We are able to extend under our adaptive framework to n &gt;&gt; 2 and demonstrate an example with n = 10, resulting in a posterior distribution with parameters up to dimension 310. By also considering the rank as a random quantity we can ensure our resulting trading models are able to adjust to potentially time varying market conditions in a coherent statistical framework. \u00a9 2010 International Society for Bayesian Analysis.",

    "Abstract": "Deciding which alternative is the best out of a set of alternatives, where each has multiple attributes, can be a complicated task. In both practice and literature we find that the majority of decision making methods ignore the inherent dependencies that can exist between attributes. Doing so simplifies the task at hand but at the expense of reliability and effectiveness of the entire process. If we are to trust automated trading systems, we must have full trust in the ability of the software to understand and utilize our preferences. This paper presents a method for graphically structuring dependencies among attributes and defining the resulting utility function. An example of fund selection is then given, showing how the inclusion of such dependencies is essential in performing effective decision making. \u00a9 2010 IEEE.",

    "Abstract": "The principle objective of this paper is to obtain trading rules with a low risk level which are also capable of obtaining high returns. To that purpose a methodology has been defined, based on the design of a genetic algorithm GAP and an incremental training technique adapted to the learning of series of stock market values. The GAP technique consists in a fusion of GP and GA. In GAP a chromosome is composed of a tree with language operators and a vector with numeric values. The GAP algorithm implements the automatic search for trading rules taking as objectives of the training both the optimization of the return obtained and the minimization of the assumed risk. In order to diminish high over-fitting, a technique of incremental training has been used. Applying the proposed methodology, rules have been obtained for a period of eight years of the S&P500 index. The achieved adjustment of the relation return-risk has generated rules with returns very superior in the testing period to those obtained applying habitual methodologies and even clearly superior to Buy&Hold.

    "Abstract": "Profitability of a trading system based on the momentum-like effects of asset price jumps was tested on four currency markets (EUR/USD, GBP/USD, USD/CHF and USD/JPY) and three futures markets (Light Crude Oil, E-Mini S&P 500 and VIX), on 7 frequencies (1-minute to 1-day), over a period of more than 20 years. The proposed trading system entered long and short trades in the direction of asset price jumps and held the positions for a fixed horizon, optimized on the in-sample period. The system achieved statistically significant out-sample profits for the USD/CHF, EUR/USD and GBP/USD exchange rates, especially on the 15-minute, 30-minute and 1-hour frequencies, with expected returns of up to 20\u201330% p.a., including transaction costs. On the 1-day frequency, on the USD/JPY and on the three analysed futures markets, only insignificant profits or losses were achieved. On the 1-minute frequency, the system ended with a loss for all of the assets. \u00a9 2019, University of Economics - Prague. All rights reserved.",

    "Abstract": "Flash Crash, that occurred in May 6, 2010, when the US stock markets, suddenly decreased, is a disastrous consequence of computerized trading systems that hit the US in 2010. In Congressional hearings, SEC chair Mary Schapiro pointed to computerized trading as a potential driver for stock prices to drop to just one cent. Companies that use algorithmic trading and high-frequency trading strategies however argue that the core technologies are not the cause of such failures, pointing to the fact that markets have collapsed before without any assistance from computers. Software vendor Progress Software says that Flash Crash is a more of a market structure issue, but the recovery from the situation where valuable shares were offered for a penny each came equally quickly. London Stock Exchange, and regulators such as the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and the UK's Financial Services Agency, are aimed to use the same technology as the algorithmic traders to identify potential abuses.",

    "Abstract": "Automated trading is a novel field of study in which computer programs are put in charge of deciding when and how to trade financial instruments. Intelligent agents, with their ability to act autonomously and to adapt and interact with the environment, seem like an obvious choice for the development of automated trading systems. The aim of this article is to analyze how well intelligent agents suit this task. We implemented a set of autonomous currency trading agents, using an architecture that consists of an ensemble of classification and regression models, a case-based reasoning system and an expert system. A total of six trading agents were implemented, each being responsible for trading one of the following currency pair in the Forex market: EUR/USD, EUR/JPY, EUR/CHF, USD/JPY, USD/CHF and CHF/JPY. The agents simulated trades over a period of 23 months, having all achieved a reasonable profit trading independently. However, their strategies resulted in relatively high drawdows. In order to decrease the risk inherent to these high drawdowns, the same simulation was performed while making the agents share the monetary resources. As expected, this strategy of investment diversification originated better results. Still, when the trading costs were taken into consideration, the overall trading performance was less than impressive. That was due to the fact that each agent performed too many trades, and the cost associated with the trading commissions became prohibitively high. We were able to lessen the impact of the trading costs in the total profit by integrating the agents in a multi-agent system, in which the agents communicated with each other before opening new trades. This allowed them to calculate the intended exposure to the market, which in turn enabled them to avoid redundant trades. Under simulation and using low leverage, this multi-agent system obtained a 55.7% profit in 23 months of trading, with a 9.0% maximum drawdown. \u00a9 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",

    "Abstract": "This paper presents the threshold recurrent reinforcement learning (TRRL) model and describes its application in a simple automated trading system. The TRRL is a regime-switching extension of the recurrent reinforcement learning (RRL) algorithm. The basic RRL model was proposed by Moody and Wu (1997) and used for uncovering trading strategies. We argue that the RRL is not sufficiently equipped to capture the non-linearities and structural breaks present in financial data, and propose the TRRL model as a more suitable algorithm for such environments. This paper gives a detailed description of the TRRL and compares its performance with that of the basic RRL model in a simple automated trading framework using daily data from four well-known European indices. We assume a frictionless setting and use volatility as an indicator variable for switching between regimes. We find that the TRRL produces better trading strategies in all the cases studied, and demonstrate that it is more apt at finding structure in non-linear financial time series than the standard RRL. \u00a9 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",

    "Abstract": "We propose a multi-stock automated trading system that relies on a layered structure consisting of a machine learning algorithm, an online learning utility, and a risk management overlay. Alternating decision tree (ADT), which is implemented with Logitboost, was chosen as the underlying algorithm. One of the strengths of our approach is that the algorithm is able to select the best combination of rules derived from well-known technical analysis indicators and is also able to select the best parameters of the technical indicators. Additionally, the online learning layer combines the output of several ADTs and suggests a short or long position. Finally, the risk management layer can validate the trading signal when it exceeds a specified non-zero threshold and limit the application of our trading strategy when it is not profitable. We test the expert weighting algorithm with data of 100 randomly selected companies of the S & P 500 index during the period 2003-2005. We find that this algorithm generates abnormal returns during the test period. Our experiments show that the boosting approach is able to improve the predictive capacity when indicators are combined and aggregated as a single predictor. Even more, the combination of indicators of different stocks demonstrated to be adequate in order to reduce the use of computational resources, and still maintain an adequate predictive capacity. \u00a9 2010 Taylor & Francis.",

    "Abstract": "This study investigates the effects of the Malaysian futures - cash market relationship after the migration of Malaysian crude palm oil futures (FCPO) to automated system in December 2001 by employing EGARCH-t (p, q)model specifications. Specifically, it examines whether the introduction of the automated trading system has increased or decreased the volatility level of its underlying cash market and whether the asymmetric response of volatility differs between these two markets. In addition, it compares whether volatility level and volatility persistence before and after the introduction of the automated trading system differs in FCPO market. The study covers the period from January, 2000 until December 2006. Findings reveal that the volatility persistence is marginally higher under the automated trading system relative to the open outcry system for the FCPO market; asymmetric volatility parameters for the spot market are insignificant for both pre-and post-auto periods. It appears that converting the futures market has, in part, led to higher degree of information asymmetry. \u00a9 EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2010.",

    "Abstract": "Recent technological and regulatory advances have coalesced to usher in an era where both automated and algorithmic trading routinely characterize a wealth maximization process managed by the continuous trading of equity securities. Under this approach to wealth maximization, automated trading focuses on the process determining directional trades for individual securities based upon the receipt and interpretation of new data. This paper presents a stochastic price formation algorithm that implements a cognitive decision making system modeled by twin radial basis function artificial neural networks to produce a high frequency automated trading system for individual equity securities listed on U.S. exchanges. The overall effectiveness and efficiency of the automated trading system is calibrated by estimating non-parametric quasi elasticity coefficients for individual firm fundamental characteristics. We find that automation driven by cognitive science can effectively auto-trade securities and produce changes to individual wealth that equals or exceeds the performance generated by a simple buy-and-hold strategy. We also identify four fundamental firm factors that explain the ability of the automated trading algorithm to produce a measured level of percent-positive trades. \u00a9 Izmir University of Economics, Turkey, 2010.",

    "Abstract": "This paper examines linear correlations between six emerging European stock market indices and the world's most significant index Standard & Poor's (S & P) 500. Using a unique dataset within three years of data on the indices from the markets in Bulgaria, Croatia, Hungary, Romania, Serbia and Slovenia we compare movements of the indices, find out the influences on their regularity in day-to-day movements and calculate their unidirectional correlation. We introduce movement relative sensitivity to changes in S & P 500 values for each regional index, in order to better describe unidirectional changes. Results for unidirectional correlation and movement relative sensitivity show that these two indicators can be important factor in an investor decision making process. Furthermore, we explain how these two indicators can be used as practical tool in algorithmic trading system development. Finally, we show that average unidirectional sensitivity coefficient can be used as volatility indicator.",

    "Abstract": "We describe a new public-domain open-source simulator of an electronic financial exchange, and of the traders that interact with the exchange, which is a truly distributed and cloud-native system that been designed to run on widely available commercial cloud-computing services, and in which various components can be placed in specified geographic regions around the world, thereby enabling the study of planetary-scale latencies in contemporary automated trading systems. The speed at which a trader can react to changes in the market is a key concern in current financial markets but is difficult to study latency issues using conventional market simulators, and is extremely difficult to study \"in the wild\" because of the financial and regulatory barriers to entry in conducting experimental work on real financial exchanges. Our simulator allows an exchange server to be launched in the cloud, specifying a particular geographic zone for the cloud hosting service; automated-trading clients which attach to the exchange can then also be launched in the cloud, in the same geographic zone and/or in different zones anywhere else on the planet, and those clients are then subject to the real-world latencies introduced by planetary-scale cloud communication interconnections. In this paper we describe the design and implementation of our simulator, called DBSE, which is based on a previous public-domain simulator, extended in ways that are partly inspired by the architecture of the real-world Jane Street Exchange. DBSE relies fundamentally on UDP and TCP network communications protocols and implements a subset of the FIX de facto standard protocol for financial information exchange. We show results from an example in which the exchange server is remotely launched on a cloud facility located in London (UK), with trader clients running in Ohio (USA) and Sydney (Australia). We close with discussion of how our simulator could be further used to study planetary-scale latency arbitrage in financial markets. \u00a9 2019 Dime Universita di Genova, DIMEG University of Calabria.",

    "Abstract": "In this paper, automated trading systems for futures trading will be viewed from the perspective of software agents. The market environment plays an essential role in decision making process of such agents. Decisions and capabilities of such systems are heavily dependent on trading account size. Key factors affecting the account size will be described in this text. There are typical limitations to decision making in automated trading systems, e.g. in the form of money management (risk management) rules. These limitations will be discussed in context of environment perception and interaction. We will be focused mainly on trading with futures and commodities, but most principles are applicable to other, similar, domains as well, e.g. stock market trading.",

    "Abstract": "After exchanges and alternative trading venues have introduced electronic execution mechanisms worldwide, the focus of the securities trading industry shifted to the use of fully electronic trading engines by banks, brokers and their institutional customers. These Algorithmic Trading engines enable order submissions without human intervention based on quantitative models applying historical and real-time market data. Although there is a widespread discussion on the pros and cons of Algorithmic Trading and on its impact on market volatility and market quality, little is known on how algorithms actually place their orders in the market and whether and in which respect this differs form other order submissions. Based on a dataset that - for the first time - includes a specific flag to enable the identification of orders submitted by Algorithmic Trading engines, the paper investigates the extent of Algorithmic Trading activity and specifically their order placement strategies in comparison to human traders in the Xetra trading system. It is shown that Algorithmic Trading has become a relevant part of overall market activity and that Algorithmic Trading engines fundamentally differ from human traders in their order submission, modification and deletion behavior as they exploit real-time market data and latest market movements.",

    "Abstract": "The prediction of financial time series is a very complicated process. An initial look at financial time series gives the impression that they are random in nature. If true, this would make the forecast, and therefore the trading, of such series exceptionally difficult. The efficient market hypothesis states that the current price contains all available information in the market. This leads to the predictability of most financial time series as being a rather controversial issue. Experts have been forecasting and trading financial markets for decades, using their knowledge and expertise in recognizing patterns and interpreting current financial data. This paper extends the Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System to create an expert system that is capable of using fuzzy reasoning combined with the pattern recognition capability of neural networks to be used in financial forecasting and trading. The novelty of the approach lies in its application to the field of high frequency finance. Such an approach has not been used so far with high frequency trading or as a part of an automated trading strategy. This has produced an expert trading system which overcomes the physical limitations of human experts and traders in taking multiple decisions at extremely short time intervals. This means the system can perform predictions and trading decisions at a very high frequency using intra-day data. \u00a9 2009 IEEE.",

    "Abstract": "Trading automation is a hotspot in the field of financial research. The key to an automated trading system is the buy&sell rule. Various technical indicators have been studied and developed to generate the trading signal of buy and sell. Each indicator has its advantage and disadvantage. Single indicator often produces false signal which may cause loss.In order to promote quality and reliability of trading signal,this paper present a method to fuse multiple indicators based on D-S theory. Some classical indicators including MACD,RSI,CCI and are selected to be fused. A corresponding trading strategy backtesting on Euro vs US dollar in 2008s is done to validate the effectiveness of this method compared with using single indicator. \u00a9 2009 IEEE.",

    "Abstract": "Statistical arbitrage refers to a class of algorithmic trading systems implementing data mining strategies. In this chapter we describe a computational framework for statistical arbitrage based on support vector regression. The algorithm learns the fair price of the security under management by minimining a regularized \u03b5-insensitive loss function in an on-line fashion, using the most recent market information acquired by means of streaming financial data. The difficult issue of adaptive learning in non-stationary environments is addressed by adopting an ensemble learning approach, where a meta-algorithm strategically combines the opinion of a pool of experts. Experimental results based on nearly seven years of historical data for the iShare S&P 500 ETF demonstrate that satisfactory risk-adjusted returns can be achieved by the data mining system even after transaction costs. \u00a9 2009 Springer US.",

    "Abstract": "A number of studies compare the efficiency and transparency of floor trading with automated/electronic trading systems in the competition for order flow. Although most of these studies find that electronic systems lead price discovery, a few studies highlight the weaknesses of electronic trading in highly volatile market conditions. A series of unusual events in 2006, sparking extreme volatility in natural gas futures trading, provide an ideal setting to revisit the resilience of trading system price leadership in the face of high volatility. We estimate time-varying Hasbrouck-style information shares to investigate the intertemporal and cross-sectional dynamics in price discovery. The results strongly suggest that the information share is time-dependent and contract-dependent. Floor trading dominates price discovery in the less liquid longer-maturity contracts, whereas electronic trading dominates price discovery in the most liquid spot-month contract. We find that the floor trading information share increases significantly with realized volatility. \u00a9 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

Innovative streaming applications are being developed in areas ranging from scientific applications (for example, environment monitoring), to business intelligence (for example, fraud detection and trend analysis), to financial markets (for example, algorithmic trading systems). In this paper we describe Streamsight, a new visualization tool built to examine, monitor and help understand the dynamic behavior of streaming applications. Streamsight can handle the complex, distributed and large-scale nature of stream processing applications by using hierarchical graphs, multi-perspective visualizations, and de-cluttering strategies. To address the dynamic and adaptive nature of these applications, Streamsight also provides real-time visualization as well as the capability to record and replay. All these features are used for debugging, for performance optimization, and for management of resources, including capacity planning. More than 100 developers, both inside and outside IBM, have been using Streamsight to help design and implement large-scale stream processing applications. \u00a9 2009 Palgrave Macmillan.",

    "Abstract": "Automated trading systems play an increasingly important role in equity markets. The challenge of trading large order volumes and baskets is often met today with automated trading algorithms. An investment decision generally leads to orders with specifications such as security, size, and urgency but also specifications (e.g., expected profit), and constraints (e.g., dollar neutrality) may be given. The trader has to choose a trading strategy ensuring best execution under given marginal constraints. This review provides an overview of how such trading algorithms work. The ideas behind some standard strategies are presented, as well as approaches to enhance them. For developing automated trading strategies for stock markets, a deep understanding in market microstructure is necessary, so we review this topic as well. We have a look on the issue how market quality is affected by market designs of trading platforms and fragmentation of the market. Trading costs are the main attribute of market quality. Trading strategies are implemented to optimize trading costs and execution risk by taking market microstructure aspects into account. Empirical analyses of trading volume and order book characteristics help to adjust the trading strategies. \u00a9 Jan Fraenkle, Svetlozar T. Rachev, 2009.",

    "Abstract": "A number of recent emerging applications call for studying data streams, potentially infinite flows of information updated in real-time. When multiple co-evolving data streams are observed, an important task is to determine how these streams depend on each other, accounting for dynamic dependence patterns without imposing any restrictive probabilistic law governing this dependence. In this paper we argue that flexible least squares (FLS), a penalized version of ordinary least squares that accommodates for time-varying regression coefficients, can be deployed successfully in this context. Our motivating application is statistical arbitrage, an investment strategy that exploits patterns detected in financial data streams. We demonstrate that FLS is algebraically equivalent to the well-known Kalman filter equations, and take advantage of this equivalence to gain a better understanding of FLS and suggest a more efficient algorithm. Promising experimental results obtained from a FLS-based algorithmic trading system for the S&P 500 Futures Index are reported. \u00a9 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

    "Abstract": "Evaluating automated trading systems (using technical analysis) is sometimes difficult because of curve-fitting, survivorship bias, etc. In this paper, we report our use of random walk stocks (GARCH (1, 1) model) to evaluate automated trading systems. We created three conditions: an uptrend market, a downtrend market, and an oscillating market generating 10000 paths using the GARCH model. We applied the simple strategies using technical analysis to the random walk securities as future stock prices. We observed the approximate characteristics of the automated trading system in the three conditions. This approach has a possibility to evaluate the automated trading systems in the same scale regardless of the complexity of the algorithms.",

    "Abstract": "In practice, it is difficult to gain profit in the process of trading interest rate derivative commodities. This could be attributed to the complexity of existing pricing models, which are derived from the term structure and yield curve, both of which cannot adapt well to short-term market dynamics. In this study, we use the Extended Classifier System (XCS) to model the market behavior of interest rate futures, the purpose of which is to provide effective trading decision support. Several technical indicators and their first- and second-order derivatives are selected as the market descriptive variables, which are then used for XCS training. Finally, the adaptive rules of the classifiers, which consist of conditions with relative actions considered helpful for constructing the automatic trading system, are generated from the XCS knowledge discovery process. The market data of the 10-year government bond futures traded in Taiwan are chosen for empirical study to verify the accuracy and profitability of the XCS model. These were also used to conduct a comparative evaluation between the random walk and tendency following models and the XCS model. \u00a9 2008 IEEE.",

    "Abstract": "Two hypotheses have been advanced to explain why spreads on NASDAQ were substantially higher than those on the NYSE in the 1990s: \"collusion\" and \"preferencing and payment for order flow.\" We present data on all actively traded stocks in these markets of relative effective spreads (RES), aggregated monthly over 1987-1999 and advance a third hypothesis: NASDAQ \"SOES-day-trading.\" We estimate NASDAQ and NYSE informed-trade losses and gains to market makers and other liquidity providers on six trade sizes, and find that losses on trades we ascribe to SOES day traders were substantially greater than those on other trades, offset somewhat by gains from small-trade-size investors. NASDAQ market makers' response to these losses and additional operations costs incurred to reduce the losses resulted in greater RES and increased trading within the best quotes, predominantly on larger trade sizes. The data are consistent with the \"SOES-day-trading\" hypotheses, but not with the other two. Furthermore, the mandatory SOES \"experiment\" provides insights into the negative effects of automated trading systems (such as ECNs, which now dominate NASDAQ) when their design does not adequately consider opportunistic traders. \u00a9 2007 Elsevier B.V.

    "Abstract": "The financial markets industry is at the same crossroads as the automotive industry in the late 1970s. Margins are collapsing and customization is rapidly increasing. The automotive industry turned to quality and its no coincidence that in the money management industry many of the spectacular failures have been due largely to problems in quality control. The financial industry in on the verge of a quality revolution. New and old firms alike are creating new investment vehicles and new strategies that are radically changing the nature of the industry. To compete, mutual funds, hedge fund industries, banks and proprietary trading firms are being forced to quicklyy research, test and implement trade selection and execution systems. And, just as in the early stages of factory automation, quality suffers and leads to defects. Many financial firms fall short of quality, lacking processes and methodologies for proper development and evaluation of trading and investment systems. Authors Kumiega and Van Vliet present a new step-by-step methodology for such development. Their methodology (called K|V) has been presented in numerous journal articles and at academic and industry conferences and is rapidly being accepted as the preferred business process for the institutional trading and hedge fund industries for development, presentation, and evaluation of trading and investment systems. The K|V model for trading system development combines new product development, project management and software development methodologies into one robust system. After four stages, the methodology requires repeating the entire waterfall for continuous improvement. The discussion quality and its applications to the front office is presented using lessons learned by the authors after using the methodology in the real world. As a result, it is flexible and modifiable to fit various projects in finance in different types of firms. Their methodology works equally well for short-term trading systems, longer-term portfolio management or mutual fund style investment strategies as well as more sophisticated ones employing derivative instruments in hedge funds. Additionally, readers will be able to quickly modify the standard K|V methodology to meet their unique needs and to quickly build other quantitatively drive applications for finance. At the beginning and the end of the book the authors pose a key question: Are you willing to change and embrace quality for the 21st century or are willing to accept extinction? The real gem in this book is that the concepts give the reader a road map to avoid extinction. * Presents a robust framework for developing and evaluating automated trading systems based on the business problem at hand * Case studies illustrate the step-by-step process utilizing a mix of programming environments from Excel/VBA to Visual C++.Net * Chapters are supported by screenshots, equations, sample Excel spreadsheets, and programming code. \u00a9 2008 Elsevier Inc.

    "Abstract": "Portfolio management is a challenging task where humans have to make decisions under uncertainty. Since usually humans tend to avoid unknown risk, in general they don't maximize their utility function when managing a portfolio. This fact favours using an automated trading system for portfolio management. In this work, we propose an automated trading system using multiagent systems. We use fundamental and cluster analysis to select the stocks, and additionally we employ a financial distress prediction model to estimate companies financial health. We also optimize the portfolio for different investor's utility functions. Comparing our approach's results to a benchmark, we have obtained higher return values and lower risks; moreover, the approach was profitable even when we have added brokerage fees. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

    "Abstract": "Our project addresses the following problem: no platform exists allowing investors the ability to trade on international markets from a single location. The twelve leading online investment programs (by trade volume) provide access to U.S. security exchanges only. A second, related problem is the lack of a fully automated investment portal availing itself of new technologies. Many of these technologies are utilized by leading security exchanges. The electronic communications network (ECN) provides a widely used example of important new technology. ECN's allow both institutional and individual investors a network with automatic matching of buy and sell orders, excising any third party. Currently, NASDAQ ECNs handle more than 40% of trade volume, a number expected to increase. These streamlined trades show evidence of reduced fees resulting from lowered transaction costs. Also with ECN's, we see initial signs of increased individual order matching speed. This evidence demonstrates the good chances for developing a global, fully automated trading system. The GoTrade team objective is to develop the initial design, simulate, and conduct analysis of an online trading system that provides global market access to any potential investor with an internet connection. The team plans to design a system that is secure, fully automated, and situated to optimize connectivity to global markets based upon expected user population distributions and current global internet infrastructure. To keep the project manageable, we limit our research to the NASDAQ, London, and Hong Kong Exchanges. We plan to build a model of our system in Arena and test the performance versus cost of various design alternatives. The factors most important to our system are performance and cost. This determination was made after survey elicitation, interviews with online investors, and consultations with our sponsor and technical advisors. The trade-off analysis associated with these measures will aid in determining the final system configuration.",

    "Abstract": "Credit default swaps (CDSs) are among the most successful financial innovations of recent years, which is reflected in the rapidly expanding market. CDS trading occurs in the over-the-counter market, which relies heavily on broker intermediation to arrange trades. We provide empirical evidence that liquidity in the voice brokered market varies with the particulars of the CDS contracts and that the differences in market structure is reflected in the costs of liquidity. Moreover, the brokered and direct interdealer trading markets seem to be well integrated; thus the higher liquidity costs in the brokered market may reflect the value of intermediation. Hybrid market structures, which combine voice brokerage with an electronic platform, are discussed as a viable alternative to fully automated trading systems. \u00a9 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",

    "Abstract": "Investment strategies are usually based on forecasting models, and these are optimized with respect to past predictive performance. However, the main goal of most investors is the optimization of a risk-adjusted performance measure, such as the well-known Sharpe index. This issue has been approached by a few different studies within the area of Neurocomputing. The present paper briefly describes and empirically compares some of the models and methods proposed in those studies. Such adaptive methods can be computationally demanding, and convergence to high-quality solutions can be difficult to achieve, yet they can be very useful in automated trading systems, namely for portfolio management. In particular, the Q-learning algorithm, when combined with neural networks for value function approximation, seems to be a reasonably competitive approach, although not overall superior to alternative ones. \u00a9 2005 Elsevier B.V.

    "Abstract": "This paper examines the choice of trading venue by dealers in U.S. Treasury securities to determine when services provided by human intermediaries are difficult to replicate in fully automated trading systems. When Treasury securities go \"off the run\" their trading volume drops by more than 90%. This decline in trading volume allows us to test whether intermediaries' knowledge of the market and its participants can uncover hidden liquidity and facilitate better matching of customer orders in less active markets. Consistent with this hypothesis, the market share of electronic intermediaries falls from 81% to 12% when securities go off the run.",

    "Abstract": "This paper introduces adaptive reinforcement learning (ARL) as the basis for a fully automated trading system application. The system is designed to trade foreign exchange (FX) markets and relies on a layered structure consisting of a machine learning algorithm, a risk management overlay and a dynamic utility optimization layer. An existing machine-learning method called recurrent reinforcement learning (RRL) was chosen as the underlying algorithm for ARL. One of the strengths of our approach is that the dynamic optimization layer makes a fixed choice of model tuning parameters unnecessary. It also allows for a risk-return trade-off to be made by the user within the system. The trading system is able to make consistent gains out-of-sample while avoiding large draw-downs. \u00a9 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

    "Abstract": "Quantitative trading is an automated trading system in which the trading strategies and decisions are conducted by a set of mathematical models. Quantitative trading applies a wide range of computational approaches such as statistics, physics, or machine learning to analyze, predict, and take advantage of big data in finance for investment. This work studies core components of a quantitative trading system. Machine learning offers a number of important advantages over traditional algorithmic trading. With machine learning, multiple trading strategies are implemented consistently and able to adapt to real-time market. To demonstrate how machine learning techniques can meet quantitative trading, linear regression and support vector regression models are used to predict stock movement. In addition, multiple optimization techniques are used to optimize the return and control risk in trading. One common characteristic for both prediction models is they effectively performed in short-term prediction with high accuracy and return. However, in short-term prediction, the linear regression model is outperform compared to the support vector regression model. The prediction accuracy is considerably improved by adding technical indicators to dataset rather than adjusted price and volume. Despite the gap between prediction modeling and actual trading, the proposed trading strategy achieved a higher return than the S&P 500 ETF-SPY. \u00a9 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.",

    "Abstract": "A global trend towards automated trading systems encourages the appearances of different kinds of decision support systems (DSS) for securities trading. However, the efficiency and effectiveness of the trading decisions and investment strategies suggested by a computer based system are always being oppugned by researchers for abnegating the specialists' professional intermediary roles in traditional floor trading. Without proper validations, evaluations and comparisons, those valuable decision support systems can hardly be adopted trustily. This paper presents a Web-service-agents-based Securities Trading Simulation System (STSS) as a platform to validate, evaluate and compare the existing securities trading decision support systems by using the real world securities trading data from Chicago Stock Exchange. Agent technology is applied to deal with the complex, dynamic, and distributed securities trading processes. Web-services techniques are proposed for more interoperability and scalability in network-based business environment. By integrating agent technology with Web-services to make use of the advantages of both, this approach provides a more intelligent, flexible, and comprehensive platform to simulate the securities trading process. Performance of different decision support systems for securities trading can be validated, evaluated and compared either separately or simultaneously on a real time basis.",

    "Abstract": "The interaction of organizational setting with cognitive schemas provides the content for analyzing futures prices as outcome of organizational sensemaking instead of a priori inputs of markets. It defines the process by which information is transformed into an ontologically stable category of price. Reconstructing this sensemaking is a crucial task, since the settlement of prices for futures markets has significant organizational and economic consequences. And the recent emergence of electronic trading as an alternative to traditional ways of trading makes this issue more vivid. Futures exchanges have historically relied on a trading technology known as \"open outcry,\" where traders gather in a central physical location to buy and sell futures contracts on a range of physical and financial commodities. The organizational practices of open outcry produces prices deeply embedded in the interactions among these traders. Since the early 1990s, the technology of futures trading has been challenged by the introduction of electronic trading platforms. Automated trading systems shift the point of exchange from a centralized physical location to a decentralized network of terminals, located in investment banks and smaller boutique trading firms. With the elimination of the exchange trading floor and transformation of trading technology, the schemas and organizational settings that supported the creation of prices in open outcry have required renegotiation. This paper uses participant observation and interview data gathered on the trading floors of open outcry and electronic exchanges to investigate how sensemaking leads to the production of futures market prices.",

    "Abstract": "Realizing the benefits of stock markets in real economies, the Jordanian capital market - the Amman Stock Exchange (ASE) - was established in 1978. After more than two decades, the manual trading system of the market was replaced by a computerized trading mechanism on March 27,2000. The primary objective of the new system is to offer investors more protection and transparency. This paper examines the efficiency of the ASE vis-\u00e0-vis the date of its automation. Based on a multifactor model with time-varying coefficients, the results show that the moved to electronic trading system had no significant impact on the ASE's efficiency. For volatility, however, we found evidence that suggests there was an increase in volatility after the introduction of automated trading. \u00a9 2005 M.E. Sharpe, Inc. All rights reserved.",

    "Abstract": "Market transparency lies at the heart of debate about floor versus automated trading systems, the informational advantages of market makers, and inter-market competition between trading systems. Since changes in transparency regimes are rare, analysis of each event becomes more crucial in our ability to evaluate prevailing theory accurately. We examine the natural experiment affected by the Toronto Stock Exchange when it publicly disseminated the limit order book on both the traditional floor and on its automated trading system. This change in transparency regime allows us to isolate the effects of increased transparency while controlling for stock-specific factors and for type (floor or automated) of trading system. We find that the increase in transparency reduces liquidity. In particular, execution costs and volatility increase after the limit order book is publicly displayed. We also show that the reduction in liquidity is associated with significant declines in stock prices. \u00a9 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

Because they can opportunistically seize liquidity, using a floor broker is equivalent to placing a \"smart\" limit order. Overall, floor trades have a lower realized half-spread than PER trades (-3.06 bps vs. 4.43 bps). This finding holds for other measures of execution costs and is consistent across all order-size categories.

    "Abstract": "This study investigates high frequency currency trading with neural networks trained via recurrent reinforcement learning (RRL). We compare the performance of single layer networks with networks having a hidden layer and examine the impact of the fixed system parameters on performance. In general, we conclude that the trading systems may be effective, but the performance varies widely for different currency markets and this variability cannot be explained by simple statistics of the markets. Also we find that the single layer network outperforms the two layer network in this application. \u00a9 2003 IEEE.",

    "Abstract": "For building an automatic trading system one needs: a significant variable for characterizing the financial asset behaviours; a suitable algorithm for finding out the information hidden in such a variable; and a proper Trading Strategy for transforming these information in operative indications. Starting from recent results proposed in literature, we have conjectured that the Technical Analysis approach could reasonably extract the information present in prices and volumes. Like tool able to find out the relation existing between the Technical Analysis inputs and an output we properly defined, we use the Group Method of Data Handling, a soft-computing approach which gives back a polynomial approximation of the unknown relationship between the inputs and the output. The automatic Trading Strategy we implement is able both to work in real-time and to return operative signals. The system we create in such a way not only performs pattern recognition, but also generates its own patterns. The results obtained during an intraday operating simulation on the US T-Bond futures is satisfactory, particularly from the point of view of the trend direction detection, and from the net profit standpoint. \u00a9 2002 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",

    "Abstract": "Successful stock traders have been using support-resistance lines for their trading decisions for decades. At the same time, correctly identifying these imaginary lines is one of the greatest challenges that they constantly face due to the complex and mostly inconsistent nature of this phenomenon. Still, these lines are considered among one of the most important technical indicators for designating buy-sell points. It is very difficult, if not impossible to determine the best support-resistance lines for any given stock; hence most of the time, the traders manually draw these imaginary lines on stock charts and implement their trading strategies accordingly. In this study, our aim is automatically identifying these lines through an evolutionary optimization algorithm (PSO) and using these support-resistance points for deciding the optimum buy-sell points. The proposed strategy is compared against Buy Hold. The results indicate using optimized support-resistance lines can be used for identifying buy-sell points, meanwhile if we only decide to use these automatically-generated lines, no significant improvement was observed when compared to Buy Hold strategy. However, this is a preliminary study and more analyses need to be performed. If the model is used as one of the multiple inputs to a more comprehensive trading system along with other technical/fundamental indicators, better results might be achieved. \u00a9 2019 IEEE.",

    "Abstract": "In this paper, we investigated the profitability of technical analysis as applied to the stock markets of the BRICS member nations. In addition, we searched for evidence that technical analysis and fundamental analysis can complement each other in these markets. To implement this research, we created a comprehensive portfolio containing the assets traded in the markets of each BRICS member. We developed an automated trading system that simulated transactions in this portfolio using technical analysis techniques. Our assessment updated the findings of previous research by including more recent data and adding South Africa, the latest member included in BRICS. Our results showed that the returns obtained by the automated system, on average, exceeded the value invested. There were groups of assets from each country that performed well above the portfolio average, surpassing the returns obtained using a buy and hold strategy. The returns from the sample portfolio were very strong in Russia and India. We also found that technical analysis can help fundamental analysis identify the most dynamic companies in the stock market. \u00a9 2018, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "We have previously described trading systems based on unsupervised learning approaches such as reinforcement learning and genetic algorithms which take as input a collection of commonly used technical indicators and generate profitable trading decisions from them. This article demonstrates the advantages of applying evolutionary algorithms to the reinforcement learning problem using a hybrid credit assignment approach. In earlier work, the temporal difference reinforcement learning approach suffered from problems with overfitting the in-sample data. This motivated the present approach. Technical analysis has been shown previously to have predictive value regarding future movements of foreign exchange prices and this article presents methods for automated high-frequency FX trading based on evolutionary reinforcement learning about signals from a variety of technical indicators. These methods are applied to GBPUSD, USDCHF and USDJPY exchange rates at various frequencies. Statistically significant profits are made consistently at transaction costs of up to 4bp for the hybrid system while the standard RL is only able to trade profitably up to about 1bp slippage per trade. \u00a9 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2002.",

This paper compares the trade execution costs of similar stocks in an automated trading structure (Paris Bourse) and a floor-based trading structure (NYSE). Results indicate that execution costs are higher in Paris than in New York after controlling for differences in adverse selection, relative tick size, and economic attributes across samples. These results suggest that the present form of the automated trading system may not be able to fully replicate the benefits of human intermediation on a trading floor.",

Past and current approaches to the regulation of automated trading systems are described. Issues are identified that are common to a variety of international jurisdictions and to trading in financial instruments other than common stocks. The analysis emphasizes the use of the definition of an 'exchange' for the purpose of classification and regulation of automated trading systems. The main theme, however, is regulation of market structure, defined as comprising the rules and institutions that determine competition between trading platforms.",

We explore informational asymmetries across the trader population: Traders located outside Germany in non-German-speaking cities show lower proprietary trading profit. Their underperformance is not only statistically significant, it is also of economically significant magnitude and occurs for the 11 largest German blue-chip stocks. We also examine whether a trader location in Frankfurt as the financial center, or local proximity of the trader to the corporate headquarters of the traded stock, or affiliation with a large financial institution results in superior trading performance. The data provide no evidence for a financial center advantage or of increasing institutional scale economies in proprietary trading. However, we find evidence for an information advantage due to corporate headquarters proximity for high-frequency (intraday) trading.",

    "Abstract": "The past decade has been one of enormous change in the securities trading industry. Automation of trading systems, led by the continental European exchanges and US 'electronic communications networks' (ECNs), has resulted in significant declines in trading costs, massive increases in turnover, internationalization of trading and settlement system operations, and major reforms in exchange governance. Yet the policy advice given to developing country governments looking to create or expand securitized finance in their markets has been largely unaffected by these developments. This is unfortunate, as developing countries now have the opportunity to leapfrog the evolving infrastructure of the mature markets and to define the global efficient frontier in trading technology, exchange governance, investor access and market structure regulation. This paper analyses the technological and economic force driving change in the securities trading industry, and examines the implications for developing markets.",

    "Abstract": "This paper examines the impact of automated trading in the stock market on the information transmission between the stock and futures markets. This issue is of particular relevance given the trend of exchanges to introduce automated trading. We focus on the Australian market as its institutional features and recent changes in trading systems have created an ideal environment for examining this issue. We initially find evidence of a substantial bidirectional information flow between the stock and futures markets. The paper then focuses on the period surrounding the move by the Australian stock exchange to automated trading. After the introduction of automated trading, we find a significant change in the information transfer process between the two markets. The findings are consistent with the hypothesis that automated trading results in a richer and more timely information set which accelerates the price discovery process. However, the evidence is not overwhelming and alternative explanations exist. \u00a9 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",

    "Abstract": "This paper analyses the relative merits of an automated versus an open outcry trading system for a derivatives contract which is traded simultaneously at two competing exchanges. The only characterizing difference between these exchanges is the mode of operation. The domestic exchange (listing the underlying asset) operates by automated trading, the foreign exchange uses open outcry. Investigations are made to determine whether this operational competition supports a trading system segmentation hypothesis. First, quote setting is investigated to determine whether or not it is related to the transparency of the trading system. Second, analysis is carried out to determine whether the transparency of the trading system influences the lead/lag relationship in returns and volatility between the two markets. Both hypotheses are empirically tested for the Bund futures contract as it is traded in London (LIFFE) and Frankfurt (DTB).",

    "Abstract": "In order to smooth out the trading process and to offer customers real-time information, the \u2018electronic trading system\u2019 (ETS) on the Taiwan Futures Exchange (TAIFEX) has increased the frequency of market information updates and shortened the quote display time interval in the electronic open book on three separate occasions from the initial five-second period, to three seconds on 6 March 2006, one second on 28 January 2008, and a quarter of a second on 31 August 2009. According to the analyses of the around event without contamination by the sub-prime financial crisis and structure changes, our findings indicate a persistent decrease both in spread and transient volatility, and a persistent increase in depth in the period following the continuous reduction in the public latency. These results suggest that an increase pre-trade transparency by continuously updating order book information dissemination technology systems in millisecond trading environment can improve market quality. \u00a9 2018 Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois",

    "Abstract": "This study examines the effect of the adoption of an automated trading system for equity trading on the Vancouver Stock Exchange (VSE). We find that the VSE's automation of its order processing has a positive influence on its trading activity, with market liquidity increasing in the post-automation period. We find, however, no evidence to support the contention that automation of securities trading destabilizes the market by increasing its volatility. Our empirical results confirm the existence of a weak weekend effect as well as a significant January effect. We also find that the serial correlation structure of returns is essentially stationary compared across the pre- and post-automation periods. We conclude that automation of the VSE has increased the transparency of the market and consequently will enhance the level of investor participation and confidence in it. \u00a9 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Automated trading systems have been proved to be very helpful to traders and investors. However, most of the existing systems implemented with any statistical or neural network approaches are incapable to give accurate advice because they cannot capture the off-market information for which most of it is non-numeric. In this paper, an automated trading system which integrates the techniques from technical analysis, pattern recognition, and knowledge-based system is presented. The numeric data from the stock is processed by both the statistical method and feature extraction. The intermediate results are then used by the rule-based system which captures the off-market information in form of facts and rules. After that, the advice can be generated through the inference with the data stored in the database. For resolving the inconsistencies among the intermediate results from different components of the system. Concepts from the fuzzy set theories are employed. Further, some data from the past Hang Seng Index (HSI) is used for illustration.",

    "Abstract": "Pairs trading is a statistical arbitrage strategy, which selects a set of assets with similar performance and produces profits during these asset prices far away from rational equilibrium. Once this phenomenon exists, traders can earn the spread by longing the underperforming asset and shorting the outperforming asset. This paper proposed a novel intelligent high-frequency pairs trading system in Taiwan Stock Index Futures (TX) and Mini Index Futures (MTX) market based on deep learning techniques. This research utilized the improved time series visualization method to transfer historical volatilities with different time frames into 2D images which are helpful in capturing arbitrage signals. Moreover, this research improved convolutional neural networks (CNN) model by combining the financial domain knowledge and filterbank mechanism. We proposed Filterbank CNN to extract high-quality features by replacing the random-generating filters with the arbitrage knowledge filters. In summary, the accuracy is enhanced through the proposed method, and it proves that the integrated information technology and financial knowledge could create the better pairs trading system. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

    "Abstract": "Computational intelligence techniques for financial trading systems have always been quite popular. In the last decade, deep learning models start getting more attention, especially within the image processing community. In this study, we propose a novel algorithmic trading model CNN-TA using a 2-D convolutional neural network based on image processing properties. In order to convert financial time series into 2-D images, 15 different technical indicators each with different parameter selections are utilized. Each indicator instance generates data for a 15 day period. As a result, 15 \u00d7 15 sized 2-D images are constructed. Each image is then labeled as Buy, Sell or Hold depending on the hills and valleys of the original time series. The results indicate that when compared with the Buy & Hold Strategy and other common trading systems over a long out-of-sample period, the trained model provides better results for stocks and ETFs. \u00a9 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "In this study, we investigate ordering patterns of different types of market participants in Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) by examining order records of the listed stocks. Firstly, we categorize the virtual servers in the trading system of TSE, each of which is linked to a single trading participant, by the ratio of cancellation and execution in the order placement as well as the number of executions at the opening of the afternoon session. Then, we analyze ordering patterns of the servers in the categories in short intervals for the top 10 highest trading volume stocks. By classifying the intervals into four cases by returns, we observe how different types of market participants submit or execute orders in the market situations. Moreover, we investigate the shares of the executed volumes for the different types of servers in the swings and roundabouts of the Nikkei 225 index, which were observed in September in 2015. The main findings of this study are as follows: Server type A, which supposedly includes non-market making proprietary traders with high-speed algorithmic strategies, executes and places orders along with the direction of the market. The shares of the execution and order volumes along with the market direction increase when the stock price moves sharply. Server type B, which presumably includes servers employing a market making strategy with high cancellation and low execution ratio, shifts its market making price ranges in the rapid price movements. We observe that passive servers in Server type B have a large share and buy at low levels in the price falls. Also, Server type B, as well as Server type A, makes profit in the price falling days and particularly, the aggressive servers in the server type make most of the profit. Server type C, which is assumed to include servers receiving orders from small investors, constantly has a large share of execution and order volume. \u00a9 2018, Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.",

    "Abstract": "Automatic trading systems are typical complex systems, and a successful automatic trading system should be excellent at prediction and decision. Stock prices are affected by the information from various sources, while traditional automatic trading systems only consider the historical trading data. For this issue, we design an automatic trading framework by considering the signals from stock prices and new information based on artificial neural networks. Specifically, we first analyze various kinds of financial events and their corresponding effects on stock prices, and then extract the financial events that have prominent effects on stock prices. Next, we design an automatic trading model driven by stock prices and financial event data. Experiments on real world datasets show that the proposed ANN-News model outperforms the conventional machine learning models by about 4% in prediction precision and 7% in return, respectively.

    "Abstract": "In this paper a novel clustering-based system for automated stock market trading is introduced. It relies on interpolative Boolean algebra as underlying mathematical framework used to construct logical clustering method which is the central component of the system. The system uses fundamental analysis ratios, more precisely market valuation ratios, as clustering variables to differentiate between undervaluated and overvaluated stocks. To structure investment portfolio, the proposed system uses special weighting formulas which automatically diversify investment funds. Finally, a simple trading simulation engine is developed to test our system on real market data. The proposed system was tested on Belgrade Stock Exchange historical data and was able to achieve a high rate of return and to outperform the BelexLine market index as a benchmark variable. The paper has also provided in-depth analysis of the system\u2019s investment decision making process which reveals some exciting insights. \u00a9 2018, Strojarski Facultet. All Rights reserved.",

    "Abstract": "This paper presents an autonomous effective trading system devoted to the support of decision-making processes in the financial market domain. Genetic programming (GP) has been used effectively as an artificial intelligence technique in the financial field, especially for forecasting tasks in financial markets. In this paper, GP is employed as a means of automatically generating short-term trading rules on financial markets using technical indicators and fundamental parameters. The majority of forecasting tools use a fixed physical timescale, which makes the flow of price fluctuations discontinuous. Therefore, using a fixed physical timescale may expose investors to risks, due to their ignorance of some significant activities. Instead of using fixed timescales for this purpose, the trading rules are generated under a directional-change (DC) event framework. We examine the profitability of the trading systems for the Saudi Stock Exchange, and evaluate the GP forecasting performance under a DC framework through agent-based simulation market index trading. The performance of the forecasting model is compared with a number of benchmark forecasts, namely the buy-and-hold and technical analysis trading strategies. Our numerical results show that the proposed GP model under a DC framework significantly outperforms other traditional models based on fixed physical timescales in terms of portfolio return. \u00a9 2018 Infopro Digital Risk (IP) Limited.",

There is a plethora of trading systems, which include technical indicators, trend following indicators, oscillators, control indicators of price level, etc. It is common nowadays for calculations of technical indicator values to be used along with the prices of securities or shares, as training data in fuzzy, hybrid and support vector machine/regression (SVM/SVR) systems. Whether the data are used in fuzzy systems, or for SVM and SVR systems training, the historical data period selection on most occasions is devoid of validation (In this research we designate historical data as training data). We substantiate that such an expert trading system, has a profitability edge\u2014with regard to future transactions\u2014over currently applied trading strategies that merely implement parameters\u2019 optimization. Thus not profitable trading systems can be turned into profitable. To that end, first and foremost, an optimal historical data period must be determined, secondarily a parameters optimization computation must be completed and finally the right conditions of parameters must be applied for optimal parameters\u2019 selection. In this new approach, we develop an integrated dynamic computation algorithm, called the \u201cd-BackTest PS Method\u201d, for selection of optimal historical data period, periodically. In addition, we test conditions of parameters and values via back-testing, using multi agent technology, integrated in an automated trading expert system based on Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) technical indicator. This dynamic computation algorithm can be used in Technical indicators, Fuzzy, SVR and SVM and hybrid forecasting systems. The outcome crystalizes in an autonomous intelligent trading system. \u00a9 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",

    "Abstract": "The chapter discusses algorithmic trading, which refers to any automated process, consisting of a number of interconnected components, whose main aim is to perform financial transactions of any kind. Its chief advantage lies in the fact that human intervention is minimized to an acceptable extent. This is quite desirable because nowadays numerous factors affect financial decisions. Financial managers are able to deal with a limited amount of information. There are many ways to implement algorithmic trading systems. This chapter aims to highlight the efficiency of biologically inspired methodologies when incorporated in such systems. Biologically inspired intelligence comprises a range of algorithms whose common philosophy is based on the behavior of real-world, natural systems and networks. What is more, the performance of the applied nature-inspired intelligence (NII) methodologies is compared to traditional benchmark approaches such as the random portfolio construction. \u00a9 Oxford University Press 2018.

    "Abstract": "This research seeks to design, implement, and test a fully automatic high-frequency trading system that operates on the Chilean stock market, so that it is able to generate positive net returns over time. A system that implements high-frequency trading (HFT) is presented through advanced computer tools as an NP-Complete type problem in which it is necessary to optimize the profitability of stock purchase and sale operations. The research performs individual tests of the algorithms implemented, reviewing the theoretical net return (profitability) that can be applied on the last day, month, and semester of real market data. Finally, the research determines which of the variants of the implemented system performs best, using the net returns as a basis for comparison. The use of particle swarm optimization as an optimization algorithm is shown to be an effective solution since it is able to optimize a set of disparate variables but is bounded to a specific domain, resulting in substantial improvement in the final solution. \u00a9 2018 Broderick Crawford et al.",

    "Abstract": "Trading the financial markets is a common idea nowadays. Millions of market participants, individuals, companies or public funds are buying and selling different equities in order to obtain profit from the buy and sell price difference. Once the equity was established, the main question marks are when to buy, when to sell and how long to keep the opened positions. This paper will present a mathematical model for the cyclicality of the price evolution. The model can be applied for any equity in any financial market, using any timeframe. The method will gives us information about when is good to buy and when is better to sell. The price cyclicality model is also a method to establish when the price is approaching to change its behavior in order to build limit conditions to stay away the market and to minimize the risk. The fundamental news is already included in the price behavior. Being exclusively a mathematical model based on the price evolution, this method can be easily implemented in algorithmic trading. The paper will also reveal how the cyclicality model can be applied in automated trading systems and will present comparative results obtained in real-time trading environment. \u00a9 2018, Bucharest University of Economic Studies.

    "Abstract": "This paper describes the design, implementation, and successful use of the Bristol Stock Exchange (BSE) a novel minimal simulation of a centralized financial market, based on a Limit Order Book (LOB) such as is commonly in major stock exchanges. Construction of BSE was motivated by the fact that most of the world's major financial markets have automated, with trading activity that previously was the responsibility of human traders now being performed by high-speed autonomous automated trading systems. Research aimed at understanding the dynamics of this new style of financial market is hampered by the fact that no operational real-world financial exchange is ever likely to allow experimental probing of that market while it is open and running live, forcing researchers to work primarily from time-series of past trading data. Similarly, university-level education of the engineers who can create next-generation automated-trading systems requires that they have hands-on learning experiences in a sufficiently realistic teaching environment. BSE as described here addresses both needs: it has been successfully used for teaching and research in a leading UK university since 2012, and the BSE program code is freely available as open-source on GitHub. \u00a9 Institute of Information Science.

    "Abstract": "Modern trading systems are mechanic, run automatically on computers inside trading platforms and decide their position against the market through optimized parameters and algorithmic strategies. These systems now, in most cases, comprise high frequency traders, especially in the Forex market. In this research, a piece of software of an automatic high frequency trading system was developed, based on the technical indicator PIVOT (price level breakthrough). The system made transactions on hourly closing prices with weekly parameters optimization period, using the d-Backtest PS method. Through the search and checking of the results, two findings for optimization of trading strategy were found. These findings with the order they were examined and are presented in this paper are as follows: (1) the simultaneous use of \"long and short\" positions, with different parameters in a hedging account, acts as a hedging strategy, minimizing losses, in relation to a \"long or short\" in a non-hedging account for the same time period and (2) there is weak correlation of past backtesting periods between the same systems, if they are configured for \"long and short\" trades, or for just \"long\" or for just \"short\". \u00a9 Dimitrios Th.

    "Abstract": "This study presents the implementation of an automated trading system that uses three critical analyses to determine time-decisions and portfolios for investment. The approach is based on a meta-grammatical evolution methodology that combines technical, fundamental and macroeconomic analysis on a hybrid top-down paradigm. First, the method provides a low-risk portfolio by analyzing countries and industries. Next, aiming to focus on the most robust companies, the system filters the portfolio by analyzing their economic variables. Finally, the system analyzes prices and volumes to optimize investment decisions during a given period. System validation involves a series of experiments in the European financial markets, which are reflected with a data set of over nine hundred companies. The final solutions have been compared with static strategies and other evolutionary implementations and the results show the effectiveness of the proposal. \u00a9 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",

    "Abstract": "In current times, trading success depends on choosing a correct strategy. Algorithmic trading is often based on technical analysis - an approach where the values of one or several technical indicators are translated into buy or sell signals. Thus, every trader's main challenge is the choice and use of the most fitting trading rules. In our work, we suggest an evolutionary algorithm for generating and selecting the most fitting trading rules for interday trading, which are presented in the form of binary decision trees. A distinctive feature of this approach is the interpretation of the evaluation of the current state of technical indicators with the help of dynamic ranges that are recalculated on a daily basis. This allows to create long-term trading rules. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this system for the Top-5 stocks of the United States IT sector and discuss the ways to improve it. \u00a9 2017 FRUCT.",

    "Abstract": "Over the last decade, the task of liquidity provision in many markets has shifted from traditional market makers to autonomous, computerized trading systems. These automated systems collect, process, and react to market-wide information quicker and more comprehensively than the humans they have replaced. Here, we update the model of Glosten and Milgrom (1985) to analyze how the automation of liquidity provision affects market quality, the transaction costs of market participants, and volatility. To Glosten and Milgrom's original model, we add multiple securities and introduce an automated market maker who prices order flow for all securities contemporaneously. We find that the automated market maker transacts the majority of orders, sets prices that are more efficient, increases informed and decreases uninformed traders' transaction costs, and has no effect on volatility. The model's predictions match very well with recent empirical findings and are difficult to replicate with alternative models. \u00a9 2016",

    "Abstract": "In this paper we propose and validate a trading rule based on flag pattern recognition, incorporating important innovations with respect to the previous research. Firstly, we propose a dynamic window scheme that allows the stop loss and take profit to be updated on a quarterly basis. In addition, since the flag pattern is a trend-following pattern, we have added the EMA indicator to filter trades. This technical analysis indicator is calculated both for 15-min and 1-day timeframes, which enables short and medium terms to be considered simultaneously. We also filter the flags according to the price range on which they are developed and have limited the maximum loss of each trade to 100 points. The proposed methodology was applied to 91,309 intraday observations of the DJIA index, considerably improving the results obtained in the previous proposals and those obtained by the buy & hold strategy, both for profitability and risk, and also after taking into account the transaction costs. These results seem to challenge market efficiency in line with other similar studies, in the specific analysis carried out on the DJIA index and is also limited to the setup considered. \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Nowadays, with the rapid development of information technology, many business fields gradually usher in the era of big data. Extracting valuable information from the large data is very urgent. However, because of some limitations such as memory restrictions, data complexity or time complexity, the majority of traditional data mining methods are time consuming and low efficiency working on big data. In contrast, parallel computing is a common and reliable choice to solve that problem. In this paper, we propose a fuzzy rule discovery algorithm - fuzzy rule based classification system in the framework of MapReduce (FRBCS-MR). The proposed FRBCS-MR algorithm applies parallel computing technology to extract fuzzy rules and build fuzzy rule-base, which combines the advantage of dealing with uncertainty of fuzzy system and the ability of MapReduce in parallel computing. Future goods trading has been gradually transformed from the original manual trading to stylized trading and the stylized trading is considered to be the forefront and the most scientific mode of investment. In the experimental studies, the rules extracted by FRBCS-MR algorithm using future goods data are turned into trading strategies which are to be used in the real automated trading platform TradeBlazer (TB) to compute the profit and loss situation. The result shows that the FRBCS-MR algorithm has good profit ability and possesses a certain guiding significance for investors. \u00a9 2017 Technical Committee on Control Theory, CAA.",

    "Abstract": "Many existing Algorithmic Trading Systems (ATS) use a large number of parameters to improve the results (i.e. accurate market forecasting and maximisation of profit). However, the use of superfluous parameters can often mask underlying trends leading to result instability and an excessive risk. This paper proposes a method for choosing the minimum number of parameters that are necessary and sufficient for the ATS to demonstrate a more reliable outcome. An ATS system is implemented and tested with the method and is shown to be successful for a number of case data scenarios. \u00a9 2017 IEEE.",

The model developed first converts the financial time series data into a series of buy-sell-hold trigger signals using the most commonly preferred technical analysis indicators. Then, a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) artificial neural network (ANN) model is trained in the learning stage on the daily stock prices between 1997 and 2007 for all of the Dow30 stocks. Apache Spark big data framework is used in the training stage. The trained model is then tested with data from 2007 to 2017. The results indicate that by choosing the most appropriate technical indicators, the neural net- work model can achieve comparable results against the Buy and Hold strategy in most of the cases. Furthermore, fine tuning the technical indicators and/or optimization strategy can enhance the overall trading performance. Copyright 2017 ACM.",

The proposed system takes advantage from the flexibility of grammars for introducing and testing novel characteristics. The ATS introduces the self-generation of new technical indicators and multi-strategies for stopping unforeseen losses. Additionally, this work copes with a novel optimization method combining multi-objective optimization with a grammatical evolution methodology. We implemented the ATS testing three different fitness functions under three mono-objective approaches and also two multi-objective ATSs. Experimental results test and compare them to the Buy and Hold strategy and a previous approach, beating both in returns and in number of positive operations. In particular, the multi-objective approach demonstrated returns up to 20 in very volatile periods, proving that the combination of fitness functions is beneficial for the ATS. \u00a9 2017 IOS Press and the authors.

    "Abstract": "Conventional food trading platforms face several issues, such as quickly to find trading objects and protect the reliability of transaction information. With e-commerce developing rapidly, food trading has also recently shifted to the online domain. Blockchain has changed many industries owing to its robustness, decentralization and end-to-end credibility. This paper proposes a novel Food Trading System with COnsortium blockchaiN (FTSCON) to improve trust and security issues in transactions. It uses consortium blockchain technology to set permission and authentication for different roles in food transaction, which meet the challenge of the privacy protection of multi-stakeholders. The algorithm of optimized transaction combination is designed for the purpose of helping users find suitable transaction objects. It can choose the optimized trading portfolio for buyers. The online double auction mechanism is used to eliminate competition. And the improved PBFT (iPBFT) is used to enhance efficiency of system. Moreover, a smart-contract life- cycle management method is introduced, and security analysis shows that FTSCON improves transaction security and privacy protection. Experiment results based on a series of data indicate that the proposed algorithm can achieve profit improvement of merchants. \u00a9 2018, King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals.",

    "Abstract": "The present paper investigates informational efficiency and changes in conditional volatility of the TSX before and after the implementation of an automated trading system on April 23, 1997. Using a battery of unit root, stationarity, as well as linear tests, we find that the introduction of electronic trading led to an increase in linearity dependence in TSX daily returns. In addition, when we examined the nonlinearity dependences using powerful econometric tests, we find that electronic trading has increased nonlinear dependencies in return series, which is the main cause of rejecting the Random Walk Hypothesis (RWH). Our results suggest that the automated trading system has negatively affected informational efficiency of the TSX. We also find evidence of long memory following automation which suggests that the introduction of electronic trading has increased the level of persistence of information and trading shocks. \u00a9 2015 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "The development of computational intelligence based trading strategies for financial markets has been the focus of research over the last few years. To develop efficient and effective automated trading strategies, we need to understand the workings of the market and the patterns emerging as a result of the traders interactions. In this paper, we develop an adaptive Genetic Programming (GP) agent-based trading system under Intraday Seasonality Model (ISM), which is abbreviated as GP-ISM trading system. ISM is used for creating maps and visualizing the dynamic price evolution of the asset during the day. This new model permits the recognition of periodic patterns and seasonalities in the price time series and hence eliminates any unnecessary data input. We use a high-frequency dataset of historical price data from Saudi Stock Market, which enables us to run multiple market simulation runs and draw comparisons and conclusions for the developed trading strategies. The goal of our work is to develop automated computational intelligence-based strategies for real markets, and this study facilitates a more thorough understanding of a specific market's workings and constitutes the basis for further exploration into such strategies designed for the stock market. We evaluate the intelligence of the GP-ISM trading system through agent-based simulation market index trading. For comparison, we also include four other types of trading agents in this contest, namely, zero-intelligence agents, Buy-and-Hold agents, fundamental agents and technical analysis agents. As a result, GP-ISM performs the best, which provides a general framework for the further development of automated trading strategies and decision support systems. \u00a9 2017 IOS Press and the authors.

    "Abstract": "Our aim consists in developing a software which can recognize M trading patterns in real time using Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). A trading pattern is a predefined figure indicating a specific behavior of prices. We trained M + 1 HMMs using Baum-Welch Algorithm combined with Genetic Algorithm. In particular, with HMMs we describe M trading patterns while the other one, called threshold model, can recognize all the not predefined patterns. The classification algorithm correctly recognizes 93% of the provided patterns. Thanks to the analysis of the false positive examples, we finally designed some more filters to reduce them. \u00a9 2017, University of Tartu. All rights reserved.",

National Stock Exchange is widest and full automatic trading system in India. Nifty 50 is one of the stock price investor and 50 companies were invested in the traders. Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average model is one of the most accepted forecasting models and a vital area of the Box-Jenkins approach to time series modeling. In this paper, the Nifty 50 stock market prices were evaluated and predicted the trend of upcoming trading days stock market fluctuations using Box-Jenkins methodology. From the results, it can be observed that influence R-Square value is (94%) high and Mean Absolute Percentage Error is very small for the fitted model. Thus the prediction accuracy is more suitable of Nifty 50 closing stock price. It is concluded that closing stock price of Nifty 50 taken in the present study shows slow decreasing fluctuations trend for upcoming trading days.",

    "Abstract": "In Complex Event Processing (CEP), complex events are detected according to a set of rules that are defined by domain experts. However, it makes the reliability of the system decreased as dynamic changes occur in the domain environment or domain experts make mistakes. To address such problem, this study proposes a Sequence Clustering-based Automated Rule Generation (SCARG) that can automatically generate rules by mining decision-making history of domain experts based on sequence clustering and probabilistic graphical modeling. Furthermore, based on a two-way learning approach, the proposed method is able to support automated regular or occasional rule updates. It makes self-adaptive CEP system possible by combining the rule generation method and the existing dynamic CEP systems. This technique is verified by establishing an automated stock trading system, and the performance of the system is measured in terms of the rate of return. The study solves the aforementioned problems and shows excellent results with an increase of 19.32% in performance when compared to the existing dynamic CEP technique. \u00a9 2016 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "This is an introductory work to the field of automatizing futures markets, related to commodities, so far operated by human traders. First, we build a mathematical framework for a futures market with many producers and consumers represented by automated traders in the market platform. Then we suggest an automatic trading strategy for the automatons. This strategy takes into account the forecasts of supply and demand streams as well as the evolution of nominal price. Later, we recall a set of analytical criteria used to measure the performance of a trading strategy. Next, we illustrate our approach by showing a price pattern generated by the automatic strategy and calculate its performances. Finally, we exhibit a heuristic based on simulation allowing to compute a quasi-optimal parameters matrix for this automatic trading system. \u00a9 2017 by IGI Global. All rights reserved.",

    "Abstract": "Many technical indicators have been selected as input variables in order to develop an automated trading system that determines buying and selling trading decision using optimal trading rules within the futures market. However, optimal technical trading rules alone may not be sufficient for real-world application given the endlessly changing futures market. In this study, a rule change trading system (RCTS) that consists of numerous trading rules generated using rough set analysis is developed in order to cover diverse market conditions. To change the trading rules, a rule change mechanism based on previous trading results is proposed. Simultaneously, a genetic algorithm is employed with the objective function of maximizing the payoff ratio to determine the thresholds of market timing for both buying and selling in the futures market. An empirical study of the proposed system was conducted in the Korea Composite Stock Price Index 200 (KOSPI 200) futures market. The proposed trading system yields profitable results as compared to both the buy-and-hold strategy, and a system not utilizing a genetic algorithm for maximizing the payoff ratio. \u00a9 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

    "Abstract": "Under non-parametric market conditions, investors usually become more concerned about the return of their money than about the return on their money. Protecting assets under management (AUM) becomes the surest, if not the only, path to survival and growth. High-frequency trading systems, over leveraged shadow entities, flashcrashes, and stealth central bank actions, just to name a few, contribute to create a \"Rumsfeldian\" type of world in which decision makers have to cope with a whole spectrum of \"unknowns\". This chapter explores such a conceptual model and derives from it a concise and coherent set of battle-tested heuristics aimed at designing effective investment strategies to protect assets. Over the years, exchange traded funds (ETFs) and exchange traded notes (ETNs) have become dominant investment vehicles. ETFs are synthetic or virtual assets that give investors direct access to the real-time performance of an underlying basket of assets. \u00a9 2017 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc. All rights reserved.",

    "Abstract": "The continuing economic boom has seen that many people become interested in automated trading systems with timing constraints and quality of service, called real-time trading systems. In order to realize such real-time trading systems, multi-/many-core processors are required. However, real-time trading systems are somewhat complex, and real-time operating systems struggle to offer continuous support because of their customization, robustness, maintainability, and portability compared with real-time middleware. An imprecise computation model is employed to support these trading systems, and semi-fixed-priority scheduling is a representative imprecise real-time scheduling technique for multi-/many-core processors. Unfortunately, there is no real-time middleware that supports semi-fixed-priority scheduling. This paper presents the RT-Seed real-time middleware, which implements a semi-fixed-priority scheduling algorithm, called Partitioned Rate Monotonic with Wind-up Part (P-RMWP), on Linux. P-RMWP supports the parallel-extended imprecise computation model that executes optional parts in parallel, called parallel optional parts. This paper also describes how to terminate parallel optional parts in the user space. The performance of P-RMWP is evaluated using Intel's Xeon Phi many-core system. \u00a9 2016 IEEE.",

    "Abstract": "We study trading systems using reinforcement learning with three newly proposed methods to maximize total profits and reflect real financial market situations while overcoming the limitations of financial data. First, we propose a trading system that can predict the number of shares to trade. Specifically, we design an automated system that predicts the number of shares by adding a deep neural network (DNN) regressor to a deep Q-network, thereby combining reinforcement learning and a DNN. Second, we study various action strategies that use Q-values to analyze which action strategies are beneficial for profits in a confused market. Finally, we propose transfer learning approaches to prevent overfitting from insufficient financial data. We use four different stock indices\u2014the S&P500, KOSPI, HSI, and EuroStoxx50\u2014to experimentally verify our proposed methods and then conduct extensive research. The proposed automated trading system, which enables us to predict the number of shares with the DNN regressor, increases total profits by four times in S&P500, five times in KOSPI, 12 times in HSI, and six times in EuroStoxx50 compared with the fixed-number trading system. When the market situation is confused, delaying the decision to buy or sell increases total profits by 18% in S&P500, 24% in KOSPI, and 49% in EuroStoxx50. Further, transfer learning increases total profits by twofold in S&P500, 3 times in KOSPI, twofold in HSI, and 2.5 times in EuroStoxx50. The trading system with all three proposed methods increases total profits by 13 times in S&P500, 24 times in KOSPI, 30 times in HSI, and 18 times in EuroStoxx50, outperforming the market and the reinforcement learning model. \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Recurrent reinforcement learning (RRL) has been found to be a successful machine learning technique for building financial trading systems. In this paper, we use a genetic algorithm (GA) to improve the trading results of a RRL-type equity trading system. The proposed trading system takes the advantage of GA\u2019s capability to select an optimal combination of technical indicators, fundamental indicators and volatility indicators for improving out-of-sample trading performance. In our experiment, we use the daily data of 180 S&P stocks (from the period January 2009 to April 2014) to examine the profitability and the stability of the proposed GA-RRL trading system. We find that, after feeding the indicators selected by the GA into the RRL trading system, the out-of-sample trading performance improves as the number of companies with a significantly positive Sharpe ratio increases. \u00a9 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",

    "Abstract": "This paper introduces a new probabilistic graphical model called gated Bayesian network (GBN). This model evolved from the need to represent processes that include several distinct phases. In essence, a GBN is a model that combines several Bayesian networks (BNs) in such a manner that they may be active or inactive during queries to the model. We use objects called gates to combine BNs, and to activate and deactivate them when predefined logical statements are satisfied. In this paper we also present an algorithm for semi-automatic learning of GBNs. We use the algorithm to learn GBNs that output buy and sell decisions for use in algorithmic trading systems. We show how the learnt GBNs can substantially lower risk towards invested capital, while they at the same time generate similar or better rewards, compared to the benchmark investment strategy buy-and-hold. We also explore some differences and similarities between GBNs and other related formalisms. \u00a9 2015 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "To satisfy the ever-increasing performance demand of Big Data and critical applications the data management needs to offer the flexible schema, high availability, light weight replica, high volume and high scalability features so as to facilitate the transaction. The in memory database (IMDB) eliminates the I/O bottleneck by storing data in main memory. We give a deeper analysis of current main-stream IMDB systems performance which focuses on the data structure, architecture, volume, concurrency, availability and scalability. The V3 performance model is proposed to evaluate the Velocity, Volume and Varity of the 19 IMDB systems, in order to highlight the candidates with realtime transaction and high volume processing capacity coordinately. Test results clearly demonstrate that NewSQL is better at dealing with high-frequency trading models. To fully utilize the advantages of the multi-core and many-core processors capability improvements, a three-level optimization design strategy, which includes the memory-access level, the kernel-speedup level and the data-partition level also be proposed using the hardware parallelism for achieving task-level and data-level parallelism of IMDB programs, guarantees the IMDB could accelerate the real-time transaction in an efficient way. We believe that IMDB should become a compulsive option for enterprise users. \u00a9 2015 IEEE.",

We look at automated financial trading systems, a domain with variable degrees of automation (DOA). We give examples of modelling a financial trading task for two DOAs: basket trading (a low DOA) and trend following trading (a high DOA). On the resulting DLs, both human and automated information-processing activities are presented. The steps and states of knowledge allocated to automation are first categorized by the commonly known four stages of automation, and then shaded to represent the level of automation in each stage. This work advances the understanding of automated trading, and automation in general, and may provide a deeper representation of human-automation interactions and thus better understanding of design requirements.

    "Abstract": "This work presents the Intelligent Trading Architecture (ITA), which is a new automated trading system architecture that supports multiple strategies for multiple market conditions through hierarchical trading signals generation. The central idea of the proposed system architecture is decomposing the trading problem into a set of tasks that are handled by distributed autonomous agents under a minimal central coordination. With this kind of architecture, we can take advantage of currently available and future high-performance computing systems. These systems, due to the way computer architecture has evolved in the recent past and foreseeable future, are composed of multiple processor cores. We are implementing the ITA software architecture employing the Carnegie Mellon Navigation (CARMEN) robot control software and using a publish/subscribe communication model. Together, CARMEN and this communication model allow the implementation of high-performance, scalable parallel computing systems that leverage the architecture of multi-core systems. For this work, we evaluated the data structures and algorithms employed by the symbol module of the ITA software architecture, which is responsible for maintaining the synchronized local copies of exchanges limit order books (LOB) for the instruments traded by the system. Our LOB implementation strongly outperformed a reference implementation in all evaluated parameters by more than one order of magnitude in some cases, achieving average throughputs of 4 million orders/s when creating new orders, 3 million orders/s when changing existing orders, and 17 million orders/s when querying orders.

In our experimental study we have used three different types of neural networks based on Hebb, daline and backpropagation training rules.

    "Abstract": "Many of the world's major financial markets are electronic, in the sense that all communication among traders and internal record-keeping at exchanges is entirely mediated and executed by digital computer systems and associated communications networks; and many such markets are also highly automated, in the sense that they are heavily populated by automatic algorithmic trading system which have largely replaced human traders at the point of execution in many spot markets. This has created significant demand for people skilled in writing and managing algorithmic trading systems. To provide a complete education and training in this field it is highly desirable to allow students/trainees to study the operation of their own algorithmic trading systems running live on a real financial exchange, interacting dynamically with other automated traders. This paper describes the Bristol Stock Exchange (BSE), a simulator designed and developed to meet that need. BSE provides a full implementation of the Limit Order Book (LOB) at the heart of modern financial exchanges, and includes reference implementations of several well-known leading algorithmic trading systems. BSE allows users to submit a variety of order-types including market, limit, fill-or-kill, time-to-live, immediate-or-cancel, iceberg; orders for specific actions at market-open and market-close; and linked pairs of contingent orders. BSE can be configured to allow empirical studies of issues in order routing between multiple exchanges and the performance of cross-market arbitrage trading algorithms. BSE also has provision for varying the exchange's fee structure, including implementing maker-taker and taker-maker pricing models, The Python source-code for BSE, which has been under ongoing development and extension since 2012, along with extensive documentation, is freely available on the GitHub online public repository, and can be used as a public-domain platform for teaching and research. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

    "Abstract": "The financial industry has witnessed an exceptionally fast progress of incorporating information processing techniques in designing knowledge-based automated systems for high-frequency trading (HFT). This paper proposes a sparse coding-inspired optimal trading (SCOT) system for real-time high-frequency financial signal representation and trading. Mathematically, SCOT simultaneously learns the dictionary, sparse features, and the trading strategy in a joint optimization, yielding optimal feature representations for the specific trading objective. The learning process is modeled as a bilevel optimization and solved by the online gradient descend method with fast convergence. In this dynamic context, the system is tested on the real financial market to trade the index futures in the Shanghai exchange center. \u00a9 2005-2012 IEEE.",

    "Abstract": "In this paper, we describe practical results of an algorithmic trading prototype and performance optimization related experiments for end-user code generation from customized UML models. Our prototype includes high-performance computing solutions for algorithmic trading systems. The performance prediction feature can help the traders to understand how powerful the machine they need when they have a very diverse portfolio or help hem to define the max size of their portfolio for a given machine. The traders can use our Watch Monitor for supervising the PNL (Profit and Loss) of the portfolio and other information so far. A portfolio management module could be added later for aggregating all strategies information together in order to maintain the risk level of the portfolio automatically. The prototype can be modified by end-users on the UML model level and then used with automatic Java code generation and execution within the Eclipse IDE. An advanced coding environment was developed for providing a visual and declarative approach to trading algorithms development. We learned exact and quantitative conditions under which the system can adapt to varying data and hardware parameters. \u00a9 2015 IEEE.",

    "Abstract": "Like all trading systems, high-frequency trading systems work by exploiting inefficiencies in the pricing process. Before embarking on designing a high-frequency trading system, it is important to confirm that the price data for the instrument you intend to trade exhibits inefficiencies at the time frame you intend to exploit. Tests for randomness and market efficiency should be conducted at the required time frame to confirm that the instrument is not efficient at that time frame. The results of these tests also give some direction to the future style of trading system that is likely to be successful in the required time frame. \u00a9 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

    "Abstract": "Gated Bayesian networks (GBNs) are an extension of Bayesian networks that aim to model systems that have distinct phases. In this paper, we aim to use GBNs to output buy and sell decisions for use in algorithmic trading systems. These systems may have several parameters that require tuning, and assessing the performance of these systems as a function of their parameters cannot be expressed in closed form, and thus requires simulation. Bayesian optimisation has grown in popularity as a means of global optimisation of parameters where the objective function may be costly or a black box. We show how algorithmic trading using GBNs, supported by Bayesian optimisation, can lower risk towards invested capital, while at the same time generating similar or better rewards, compared to the benchmark investment strategy buy-and-hold.",

    "Abstract": "In 1997, Moody and Wu presented recurrent reinforcement learning (RRL) as a viable machine learning method within algorithmic trading. Subsequent research has shown a degree of controversy with regards to the benefits of incorporating technical indicators in the recurrent reinforcement learning framework. In 1991, Nison introduced Japanese candlesticks to the global research community as an alternative to employing traditional indicators within the technical analysis of financial time series. The literature accumulated over the past two and a half decades of research contains conflicting results with regards to the utility of using Japanese candlestick patterns to exploit inefficiencies in financial time series. In this paper, we combine features based on Japanese candlesticks with recurrent reinforcement learning to produce a high-frequency algorithmic trading system for the E-mini S&P 500 index futures market. Our empirical study shows a statistically significant increase in both return and Sharpe ratio compared to relevant benchmarks, suggesting the existence of exploitable spatio-Temporal structure in Japanese candlestick patterns and the ability of recurrent reinforcement learning to detect and take advantage of this structure in a high-frequency equity index futures trading environment. \u00a9 2015 IEEE.",

Modern financial trading systems involve a variety of coupled socio-technical systems (e.g. humans and technologies) and have become highly automated. Recent stock market crashes, such as the well-known Flash Crash, show automation-initiated dynamics. This suggests that a human factors understanding of this environment may be useful. In this article, we report an initial attempt to model buyer-side Automated Trading (AT) systems using a Cognitive Work Analysis (CWA) approach. A Work Domain Analysis (WDA) model is presented to describe the automated financial trading domain. This work has implications for applying CWA to finance but also advances the understanding of how to model a highly automated domain. Copyright 2015 Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.",

    "Abstract": "We report successful results from using deep learning neural networks (DLNNs) to learn, purely by observation, the behavior of profitable traders in an electronic market closely modelled on the limit-order-book (LOB) market mechanisms that are commonly found in the real-world global financial markets for equities (stocks shares), currencies, bonds, commodities, and derivatives. Successful real human traders, and advanced automated algorithmic trading systems, learn from experience and adapt over time as market conditions change; our DLNN learns to copy this adaptive trading behavior. A novel aspect of our work is that we do not involve the conventional approach of attempting to predict time-series of prices of tradeable securities. Instead, we collect large volumes of training data by observing only the quotes issued by a successful sales-trader in the market, details of the orders that trader is executing, and the data available on the LOB (as would usually be provided by a centralized exchange) over the period that the trader is active. In this paper we demonstrate that suitably configured DLNNs can learn to replicate the trading behavior of a successful adaptive automated trader, an algorithmic system previously demonstrated to outperform human traders. We also demonstrate that DLNNs can learn to perform better (i.e., more profitably) than the trader that provided the training data. We believe that this is the first ever demonstration that DLNNs can successfully replicate a human-like, or super-human, adaptive trader operating in a realistic emulation of a real-world financial market. Our results can be considered as proof-of-concept that a DLNN could, in principle, observe the actions of a human trader in a real financial market and over time learn to trade equally as well as that human trader, and possibly better. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

    "Abstract": "In the past decade there has been a rapid growth of the use of adaptive automated trading systems, commonly referred to in the finance industry as \"robot traders\": AI applications replacing highly-paid human traders in the global financial markets. The academic roots of this industry-changing deployment of AI technologies can be traced back to research published by a team of researchers at IBM at IJCAI 2001, which was subsequently replicated and extended by De Luca and Cliff at IJCAI 2011 and ICAART 2011. Here, we focus on the order management policy enforced by Open Exchange (OpEx), the open source algorithmic trading system designed by De Luca, for both human and robot traders: while humans are allowed to manage multiple orders simultaneously, robots only deal with one order at the time. We hypothesise that such unbalance may have strongly influenced the victory of human traders over robot traders, reported in past studies by De Luca et al., and by Cartlidge and Cliff. We employed OpEx to implement a multiple-order policy for robots as well as humans, and ran several human vs. robot trading experiments. Using aggregated market metrics and time analysis, we reached two important conclusions. First, we demonstrated that, in mixed human-robot markets, robots dealing multiple simultaneous orders consistently outperform robots dealing one order at a time. And second, we showed that while human traders outperform single-order robot traders under specific circumstances, multiple-order robot traders are never outperformed by human traders. We thus conclude that the performance of robot traders in a human-robot mixed market is strongly influenced by the order management policy they employ.

    "Abstract": "We examine London Stock Exchange trading around information releases and link market quality dimensions with market structure during periods with heightened interaction between informed and uninformed traders. We find support for both the hypothesis that automated electronic markets minimise trading costs for liquid stocks and the hypothesis that adverse selection costs are minimised with intermediated trading. We examine how news affects both dealer and electronic systems and find that electronic markets are prone to greater stealth trading and post-trade volatility, both consistent with the proliferation of algorithmic trading and short-term volatility events such as the May 6, 2010 \u2018flash crash.\u2019. \u00a9 2012 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",

    "Abstract": "This paper proposes a performance-driven gradient boosting model (pdGBM) which predicts short-horizon price movements by combining nonlinear response functions of selected predictors. This model performs gradient descent in a constrained functional space by directly minimizing loss functions customized with different trading performance measurements. To demonstrate its practical applications, a simple trading system was designed with trading signals constructed from pdGBM predictions and fixed holding period in each trade. We tested this trading system on the high-frequency data of SPDR S&P 500 index ETF (SPY). In the out-of-sample period, it generated an average of 0.045% return per trade and an annualized Sharpe ratio close to 20 after transaction costs. Various empirical results also showed the model robustness to different parameters. These superior performances confirm the predictability of short-horizon price movements in the US equity market. We also compared the performance of this trading system with similar trading systems based on other predictive models like the gradient boosting model with L2 loss function and the penalized linear model. Results showed that pdGBM substantially outperformed all other models by higher returns in each month of the testing period. Additionally, pdGBM has many advantages including its capability of automatic predictor selection and nonlinear pattern recognition, as well as its simply structured and interpretable output function. \u00a9 2015 Taylor & Francis.",

    "Abstract": "Complex Event Processing (CEP) detects complex events or patterns of event sequences based on a set of rules defined by a domain expert. However, it lowers the reliability of a system as the set of rules defined by an expert changes along with dynamic changes in the domain environment. A human error made by an expert is another factor that may undermine the reliability of the system. In an effort to address such problems, this study introduces Collaborative Rule Mining Engine (CRME) designed to automatically mine rules based on the history of decisions made by a domain expert by adopting a collaborative filtering approach, which is effective in mimicking and predicting human decision-making in an environment where there are sufficient data or information to do so. Furthermore, this study suggests an adaptive CEP technique, which does not hamper the reliability since it prevents potential errors caused by mistakes of domain experts and adapts to changes in the domain environment on its own as it is linked to the system proposed by Bharagavi [10]. In a bid to verify this technique, an automated stocks trading system will be established and its performance will be measured using the rate of return. \u00a9 Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",

    "Abstract": "Seasonality effects and empirical regularities in financial data have been well documented in the financial economics literature for over seven decades. This paper proposes an expert system that uses novel machine learning techniques to predict the price return over these seasonal events, and then uses these predictions to develop a profitable trading strategy. While simple approaches to trading these regularities can prove profitable, such trading leads to potential large drawdowns (peak-to-trough decline of an investment measured as a percentage between the peak and the trough) in profit. In this paper, we introduce an automated trading system based on performance weighted ensembles of random forests that improves the profitability and stability of trading seasonality events. An analysis of various regression techniques is performed as well as an exploration of the merits of various techniques for expert weighting. The performance of the models is analysed using a large sample of stocks from the DAX. The results show that recency-weighted ensembles of random forests produce superior results in terms of both profitability and prediction accuracy compared with other ensemble techniques. It is also found that using seasonality effects produces superior results than not having them modelled explicitly. \u00a9 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

In this paper we consider Reinforcement Learning (RL) type algorithms, that is algorithms that real-time optimize their behavior in relation to the responses they get from the environment in which they operate, without the need for a supervisor. In particular, first we introduce the essential aspects of RL which are of interest for our purposes, second we present some original automatic FTSs based on differently configured RL-based algorithms, then we apply such FTSs to artificial and real time series of daily stock prices. Finally, we compare our FTSs with a classical one based on Technical Analysis indicators.

Automated trading systems assist the aforementioned process to a great extent. In this paper, a basic type of such a system is presented. The aim of the study focuses on the behavior of this system in changes to its parameter settings. A number of independent simulations have been conducted, for the various parameter settings, and distributions of profits/losses have been acquired, leading to interesting concluding remarks. \u00a9 2014 Springer International Publishing.",

    "Abstract": "In the last few years, the financial industry has witnessed a growing demand for an integrated multi-asset, multi-strategy trading system that allows traders to simultaneously trade different types of assets, and provides real-time risk assessments, status, and performance of the diversified portfolio. However, many factors contribute to the complexity of developing such integrated decision-making systems. Some of these factors include: the inherent diversity of financial assets, the heterogeneity of trading and risk assessment strategies, and the highly dynamic nature of financial markets. Moreover, the large volume of data to be analyzed severely affects the system's ability to make timely decisions, especially, for high-frequency trading. This paper proposes a novel Holonic Intelligent Multi-Agent Algorithmic Trading System (HIMAATS) to address the software functional requirements (multi-asset, multi-strategy, real-time risk assessment, etc.), and non-functional requirements (autonomy, high-throughput, low-latency, modularity, scalability, etc.).

    "Abstract": "Automated trading, which is also known as algorithmic trading, is a method of using a predesigned computer program to submit a large number of trading orders to an exchange. It is substantially a real-time decision-making system which is under the scope of Enterprise Information System (EIS). With the rapid development of telecommunication and computer technology, the mechanisms underlying automated trading systems have become increasingly diversified. Considerable effort has been exerted by both academia and trading firms towards mining potential factors that may generate significantly higher profits. In this paper, we review studies on trading systems built using various methods and empirically evaluate the methods by grouping them into three types: technical analyses, textual analyses and high-frequency trading. Then, we evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of each method and assess their future prospects. \u00a9 2018, \u00a9 2018 The Author(s).

    "Abstract": "Professional fund managers, investment banks and regulatory authorities raise the question about the impact of algorithmic trading on trading businesses, economy and market efficiency. The questions rise if high frequency trading (HFT) provides more efficient, liquid markets and is economically beneficial. In this paper an algorithm based on statistical arbitrage is tested. Statistical arbitrage is a well-known trading strategy where profit arises from pricing inefficiencies between correlated financial instruments. An algorithm of statistical arbitrage tries to find a pair of correlated instruments that move together and take long/short positions when they diverge abnormally, hoping that the prices will converge in the near future. Recent computational expansion in financial modeling and the ever increasing demand for order execution speed is moving market making and price discovery strategies into high frequency trading (HFT) or the milliseconds realm, where HFT already generates nearly 2/3 of the overall trading volume. In this report we apply high frequency data from NYMEX exchange to test a trading system based on statistical arbitrage in one of the most liquid futures market, i.e. natural gas futures. The overall results suggest that statistical arbitrage in HFT environment significantly outperforms traditional trading strategies, provides liquidity to the markets and denies the efficient market hypothesis. \u00a9 Vilnius University, 2002-2014 \u00a9 Brno University of Technology, 2002-2014 \u00a9 University of Latvia, 2002-2014.",

    "Abstract": "Gated Bayesian networks (GBNs) are a recently introduced extension of Bayesian networks that aims to model dynamical systems consisting of several distinct phases. In this paper, we present an algorithm for semi-automatic learning of GBNs. We use the algorithm to learn GBNs that output buy and sell decisions for use in algorithmic trading systems. We show how using the learnt GBNs can substantially lower risks towards invested capital, while at the same time generating similar or better rewards, compared to the benchmark investment strategy buy-and-hold. \u00a9 Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.",

    "Abstract": "Recent growth in algorithmic trading has caused a demand for lowering the latency of systems for electronic trading. FPGA cards are widely used to reduce latency and accelerate market data processing. To create a low latency trading system, it is crucial to effectively build a representation of the market state (book) in hardware. Thus, we have designed a new hardware architecture, which updates the book with the best bid/offer prices based on the incoming messages from the exchange. For each message a corresponding financial instrument needs to be looked up and its record needs to be updated. Proposed architecture is utilizing cuckoo hashing for the book handling, which enables low latency symbol lookup and high memory utilization. In this paper we discuss a trade-off between lookup latency and memory utilization. With average latency of 253 ns the proposed architecture is able to handle 119 275 instruments while using only 144 Mbit QDR SRAM. \u00a9 2014 IEEE.",

    "Abstract": "Recurrent reinforcement learning (RRL) is a machine learning algorithm which has been proposed by researchers for constructing financial trading platforms. When an analysis of RRL trading performance is conducted using low frequency financial data (e.g. daily data), the weakening autocorrelation in price changes may lead to a decrease in trading profits as compared to its applications in high frequency trading. There therefore is a need to improve RRL for the purposes of daily equity trading. This paper presents two parameter update schemes (the 'average elitist' and the 'multiple elitist') for RRL. The purpose of the first scheme is to improve out-of-sample performance of RRL-type trading systems. The second scheme aims to exploit serial dependence in stock returns to improve trading performance, when traders deal with highly correlated stocks. Profitability and stability of the trading system are examined by using four groups of S&P stocks for the period January 2009 to December 2012. It is found that the Sharpe ratios of the stocks increase after we use the two parameter update schemes in the RRL trading system. \u00a9 2014 IEEE.",

    "Abstract": "In this paper, we develop a formal model to specify a stock investment strategy. Based on an extensive review of investment literature, we identify determinants for portfolio performance - such as risk attitude, rebalancing interval or number of portfolio positions - and formalize them as model components. With this model, we aim to bridge the gap between pure decision support and algorithmic trading systems by enabling the implementation of investment approaches into an executable specification which forms the foundation of an automated portfolio management system. Such a system helps researchers and practitioners to specify, test, compare and execute investment approaches with strong automation support. To ensure the technical applicability of our model, we implement a prototype and use it to show the effectiveness of the model components on portfolio performance by running several investment scenarios.",

    "Abstract": "Some major financial markets are currently reporting that 50% or more of all transactions are now executed by automated trading systems (ATS). To understand the impact of ATS proliferation on the global financial markets, academic studies often use standard reference strategies, such as \u201cAA\u201d and \u201cZIP\u201d, to model the behaviour of real trading systems. Disturbingly, we show that the reference algorithms presented in the literature are ambiguous, thus reducing the validity of strict comparative studies. As a remedy, we suggest disambiguated standard implementations of AA and ZIP. Using Exchange Portal (ExPo), an open-source financial exchange simulation platform designed for realtime behavioural economic experiments involving human traders and/or trader-agents, we study the effects of disambiguating AA and ZIP, before introducing a novel method of assignment-adaptation (ASAD). Experiments show that introducing ASAD agents into a market with shocks can produce counter-intuitive market dynamics. \u00a9 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014.",

    "Abstract": "Modern financial markets are dominated by the algorithmic trading tools, which essentially changed previously observed regularities in the investment data sets. In order to develop robust and reliable trading algorithms new approaches have to be employed. In this paper we investigate how to (i) model spread of self-excited oscillations in social mediums and (ii) simulate data series of rare events' (e.g. crises). We proposed a novel multi-agent investment simulation system, composed from a multitude of artificial investing agents. Consequently, we developed a simulation tool, which can deal with self-excited oscillations and high dimensionality small sample size problems arising in the modern financial markets. The novel multi-agent system was tested with real market ant synthetic data for the period between 2007 and 2013. In an out-of-sample regime, the novel approach outperformed benchmark trading strategies. \u00a9 University of Lativia, 2002-2014.",

    "Abstract": "Knowing the characteristics of news in numerical indices one can use them in mathematical and statistical models and automated trading systems. Currently, the tools of the news analytics have been increasingly used by traders in the U.S. and Europe. The interest in news analytics is related to the ability to predict changes of prices, volatility and trading volume on the stock market. The emphasis of the paper is on assessing the added value of using news analytics data in improving the explanatory power of the GARCH-Jump model. Based on empirical evidences for some of FTSE100 companies, the paper examines two GARCH models with jumps. First we consider the well-known GARCH model with autoregressive conditional jump intensity proposed in [1]. Then we introduce the GARCH-Jumps model augmented with news intensity and obtain some empirical results. The main assumption of the model is that jump intensity might change over time and that jump intensity depends linearly on the number of news (the news intensity). The comparison of the values of log likelihood supports the hypothesis of impact of news on the jump intensity of volatility.",

    "Abstract": "In this paper, we present steps towards a model-driven financial decision support system (FDSS) to pricing options on currency futures, which can be embedded in a high-frequency trading process. Due to the difficulty of option valuation, we provide an alternative heuristic option pricing approach with neural networks. We show that the use of neural networks is not only suitable in generating accurate trading signals, but also in generating automated fast run-time trading signals for the decision taker. To achieve this, we conduct an experiment with an empirical tick data set of EUR/USD options on currency futures of four weeks. An essential advantage of our approach is the simultaneous pricing across different strike prices and parsimonious use of input variables. Nevertheless, we also have to take particular limitations into account, which give us useful hints for further research and steps. Copyright \u00a9 2014 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",
