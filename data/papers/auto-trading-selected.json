    "Abstract": "Historical financial data are frequently used in technical analysis to identify patterns that can be exploited to achieve trading profits. Although technical analysis using a variety of technical indicators has proven to be useful for the prediction of price trends, it is difficult to use them to formulate trading rules that could be used in an automatic trading system due to the vague nature of the rules. Moreover, it is challenging to determine a specified combination of technical indicators that can be used to detect good trading points and trading rules since different stock may be affected by different set of factors. In this paper, we propose a novel trading point forecasting framework that incorporates a bicluster mining technique to discover significant trading patterns, a method to establish the fuzzy rule base, and a fuzzy inference system optimized for trading point prediction. The proposed method (called BM-FM) was tested on several historical stock datasets and the average performance was compared with the conventional buy-And-hold strategy and five previously reported intelligent trading systems. Experimental results demonstrated the superior performance of the proposed trading system. \u00a9 1993-2012 IEEE.",

    "Abstract": "Ever since the advent of the financial industry, experts have attempted to create systems to track and analyze trends in the stock market. These systems have not suitably predicted future trends, limiting the advice given to consumers. Expert opinions are subject to human error and personal bias, which can potentially lead to financial losses to the consumer. Thus, a system devoid of personal bias, providing an accurate prediction is highly beneficial to the consumer, the broker and the corporations involved in financial markets. Such a system, coupled with the automatic trading system, will optimize transactions leading to overall economic growth. The proposed system performs as a basic I/O system. The input is the historical market data, and the stock to be predicted. The output is the recommendation on whether to buy or sell the stock and supplemental graphs to aid the consumer. The key modules of the system are the capture, analysis, search and visualisation modules. These feed into the prediction module, which uses the concept of mining based Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to provide a reliable recommendation. Finally, all these modules represented to the consumer with webpage based convenient format via home screen. \u00a9 2019 IEEE.",

    "Abstract": "Trading strategies intended for high frequency trading in Forex markets are executed by cutting-edge automated trading systems. Such systems implement algorithmic trading strategies and are configured with predefined optimized parameters in order to generate entry and exit orders and execute trades on trading platforms. Three high-frequency automated trading systems were developed in the current research, using the MACD (oscillator), the SMA (moving average) and the PIVOT points (price crossover) technical indicators. The systems traded on hourly time frames, employing historical data of closing prices and the parameter optimization for each system was done using the d-Backtest PS method over weekly periods. With this work we intend to extend the methods of parameter selection for automated trading systems in high frequency trading. Through this research and the interpretation and evaluation of its results, we conclude that backtesting parameters\u2019 optimization, especially through the d-Backtest PS method, is much more profitable than the default values of the parameters and that the optimization of parameters yields the highest profits through the implementation of restrictive relationships among them. It is also observed that the selection of the most profitable parameters of a trading system can be unrestricted, rendering the validation of the minor divergence occurring among slightly varying prices redundant. Meanwhile, other conclusions that can be drawn are that the most profitable classification system employed by the d-Backtest PS method is calibrated by means of two validation periods and that the most efficient profitability ratio between historical data period and validation period is 6:1 (in- and out-of-the-sample ratio). \u00a9 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",

    "Abstract": "The aim of this study is to predict automatic trading decisions in stock markets. Comprehensive features (CF) for predicting future trend are very difficult to generate in a complex environment, especially in stock markets. According to related work, the relevant stock information can help investors formulate objects that may result in better profits. With this in mind, we present a framework of an intelligent stock trading system using comprehensive features (ISTSCF) to predict future stock trading decisions. The ISTSCF consists of stock information extraction, prediction model learning and stock trading decision. We apply three different methods to generate comprehensive features, including sentiment analysis (SA) that provides sensitive market events from stock news articles for sentiment indices (SI), technical analysis (TA) that yields effective trading rules based on trading information on the stock exchange for technical indices (TI), as well as the trend-based segmentation method (TBSM) that raises trading decisions from stock price for trading signals (TS). Experiments on the Taiwan stock market show that the results of employing comprehensive features are significantly better than traditional methods using numeric features alone (without textual sentiment features). \u00a9 2014 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "In the last few years, the financial industry has witnessed a growing demand for an integrated multi-asset, multi-strategy trading system that allows traders to simultaneously trade different types of assets, and provides real-time risk assessments, status, and performance of the diversified portfolio. However, many factors contribute to the complexity of developing such integrated decision-making systems. Some of these factors include: the inherent diversity of financial assets, the heterogeneity of trading and risk assessment strategies, and the highly dynamic nature of financial markets. Moreover, the large volume of data to be analyzed severely affects the system's ability to make timely decisions, especially, for high-frequency trading. This paper proposes a novel Holonic Intelligent Multi-Agent Algorithmic Trading System (HIMAATS) to address the software functional requirements (multi-asset, multi-strategy, real-time risk assessment, etc.), and non-functional requirements (autonomy, high-throughput, low-latency, modularity, scalability, etc.).",

The central idea of the proposed system architecture is to decompose the trading problem into a set of tasks handled by distributed autonomous agents under a minimal central coordination. We implemented the proposed ATS using a software architecture that employed a publish/subscribe communication model. In the current stage of development, we are able to run our ATS in back-test mode with moving-average crossover strategies on minute-by-minute market databases.

    "Abstract": "For the better part of the last four decades academic research has focused on stock return predictability explained by asset pricing models. Financial economists approach finance theory by focusing on whether to reject a pricing model based on hypothesis tests. However, this approach often fails to capture aspects of the model and latent information in the data that could be potentially useful to the investor. Owing to these limitations, investors have increasingly turned to high-frequency trading as a means of achieving risk-mitigated wealth appreciation. High frequency trading is a strategy that relies on professional proprietary formula-driven trading algorithms to execute millisecond trades using high-speed computers that are placed near or in the proximity of the exchanges to reduce order latency time. The contemporary impact of this new approach has increased the speed and complexity of trading, and has had an impact on market liquidity and transparency. In turn, this has attracted the attention of regulators who are \"Clamping Down on Rapid Trades in the Stock Market\" [3] and the risk of such trades to create volatility by flooding the market with orders before canceling these same orders in fractions of seconds. Facing the possibility of regulatory oversight, many highfrequency automated traders are now turning to the alternative of near high-frequency trading. Instead of focusing on strategies to implement strategic runs in the millisecondenvironment, using the highest resolution data available, near high-frequency trading solves complex econometric models on an instrument by instrument basis to predict the profitability of a future trade. In this paper we present a theory of stochastic price formation to form a behavioral near high frequency automated trading system. The new system is actuated by a combining dual radial basis function artificial neural networks and two fundamental trading metrics. Additionally, because the trading signals are generated by cognitive models, the research calibrates a nonparametric behavioral production function to estimate the quasi elasticity coefficients of a four factor model. \u00a9 2013 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

    "Abstract": "This chapter proposes a hybrid high-frequency trading application based on a Type-2 Fuzzy Logic approach combined with Hilbert transforms for the detection of periodicities in high-frequency FX data. Most trading systems have concentrated on using common analytic waveforms and have not taken into consideration phasors and complex variables. The Hilbert transform, often employed to convert signal variables in analytic waveforms to complex variables, will be used for the measurement of market cycles, rather than measurement of market trends. The main objective is to investigate how the periods of the dominant cycle in a cycle mode can be quantified in order to create an amplitude compensation of the In-Phase and Quadrature components, alongside methods of smoothing and de-trending the analytic signal. The subsequent output can be defuzzified using Type 2 Fuzzy-Logic techniques, which will in turn refine the implementation of trading strategies. Type-2 Fuzzy Logic systems are becoming more popular as they account for uncertainties that are not captured within a Type-1 Fuzzy Logic system. These Type-2 systems outperform traditional Fuzzy Logic systems in forecasting problems since they can account for more variables in a more efficient way. \u00a9 2013 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

    "Abstract": "Recurrent reinforcement learning (RRL), a machine learning technique, is very successful in training high frequency trading systems. When trading analysis of RRL is done with lower frequency financial data, e.g. daily stock prices, the decrease of autocorrelation in prices may lead to a decrease in trading profit. In this paper, we propose a RRL trading system which utilizes the price information, jointly with the indicators from technical analysis, fundamental analysis and econometric analysis, to produce long/short signals for daily trading. In the proposed trading system, we use a genetic algorithm as a pre-screening tool to search suitable indicators for RRL trading. Moreover, we modify the original RRL parameter update scheme in the literature for out-of-sample trading. Empirical studies are conducted based on data sets of 238 S&P stocks. It is found that the trading performance concerning the out-of-sample daily Sharpe ratios turns better: the number of companies with a positive and significant Sharpe ratio increases after feeding the selected indicators jointly with prices information into the RRL system.",

    "Abstract": "We develop market timing strategies and trading systems to test the intra-day predictive power of Japanese candlesticks at the 5-minute interval on the 30 constituents of the DJIA index. Around a third of the candlestick rules outperform the buy-and-hold strategy at the conservative Bonferroni level. After adjusting for trading costs, however, just a few rules remain profitable. When we correct for data snooping by applying the SSPA test on double-or-out market timing strategies, no single candlestick rule beats the buy-and-hold strategy after transaction costs. We also design fully automated trading systems by combining the best-performing candlestick rules. No evidence of out-performance is found after transaction costs. Although Japanese candlesticks can somewhat predict intra-day returns on large US caps, we show that such predictive power is too limited for active portfolio management to outperform the buy-and-hold strategy when luck, risk, and trading costs are correctly measured. \u00a9 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",

The design of profitable automatic trading systems is becoming a challenging process. This requires a strong synergy of economists and computer scientists. Our aim is to provide an optimization framework for trading systems that starting from a generic strategy, enhances its performances by exploiting mathematical constraints. Moreover, the growth of new markets requires suitable solutions integrating computer science tools with economic analysis. In this work, we mainly refer to an emerging market known as Binary Options. Starting from basic strategies used every day in the stock markets by professional traders, we show how optimization issues enhance the outcoming performances.

    "Abstract": "Trend following (TF) is trading philosophy by which buying/selling decisions are made solely according to the observed market trend. For many years, many manifestations of TF such as a software program called Turtle Trader, for example, emerged in the industry. Surprisingly little has been studied in academic research about its algorithms and applications. Unlike financial forecasting, TF does not predict any market movement; instead it identifies a trend at early time of the day, and trades automatically afterwards by a pre-defined strategy regardless of the moving market directions during run time. Trend following trading has been popular among speculators. However it remains as a trading method where human judgment is applied in setting the rules (aka the strategy) manually. Subsequently the TF strategy is executed in pure objective operational manner. Finding the correct strategy at the beginning is crucial in TF. This usually involves human intervention in first identifying a trend, and configuring when to place an order and close it out, when certain conditions are met. In this paper, we evaluated and compared a collection of TF algorithms that can be programmed in a computer system for automated trading. In particular, a new version of TF called trend recalling model is presented. It works by partially matching the current market trend with one of the proven successful patterns from the past. Our experiments based on real stock market data show that this method has an edge over the other trend following methods in profitability. The results show that TF however is still limited by market fluctuation (volatility), and the ability to identify trend signal. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

    "Abstract": "Stock market prediction and trading has attracted the effort of many researchers in several scientific areas because it is a challenging task due to the high complexity of the market. More investors put their effort to the development of a systematic approach, i.e., the so called \"Trading System (TS)\" for stocks pricing and trend prediction. The introduction of the Trading On-Line (TOL) has significantly improved the overall number of daily transactions on the stock market with the consequent increasing of the market complexity and liquidity. One of the most main consequence of the TOL is the \"automatic trading\", i.e., an ad-hoc algorithmic robot able to automatically analyze a lot of financial data with target to open/close several trading operations in such reduced time for increasing the profitability of the trading system. When the number of such automatic operations increase significantly, the trading approach is known as High Frequency Trading (HFT). In this context, recently, the usage of machine learning has improved the robustness of the trading systems including HFT sector. The authors propose an innovative approach based on usage of ad-hoc machine learning approach, starting from historical data analysis, is able to perform careful stock price prediction. The stock price prediction accuracy is further improved by using adaptive correction based on the hypothesis that stock price formation is regulated by Markov stochastic propriety. The validation results applied to such shares and financial instruments confirms the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed automatic trading algorithm. \u00a9 2019 by the authors.",

Two different decision mechanisms for evaluating the overall signal given the GP signals over all time frames are also examined, one based on majority vote and another based on temporal proximity to the buying decision. Results indicated that majority vote outperformed emphasis on proximity of time frames to the current trading decision.

    "Abstract": "Automated trading systems for financial markets can use data mining techniques for future price movement prediction. However, classifier accuracy is only one important component in such a system: the other is a decision procedure utilizing the prediction in order to be long, short or out of the market. In this paper, we investigate the use of technical indicators as a means of deciding when to trade in the direction of a classifier's prediction. We compare this \"hybrid\" technical/data stream mining-based system with a naive system that always trades in the direction of predicted price movement. We are able to show via evaluations across five financial market datasets that our novel hybrid technique frequently outperforms the naive system. To strengthen our conclusions, we also include in our evaluation several \"simple\" trading strategies without any data mining component that provide a much stronger baseline for comparison than traditional buy-and-hold or sell-and-hold strategies. \u00a9 2011 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",

    "Abstract": "Based on the principles of technical analysis, this paper proposes an artificial intelligence model, which employs the Adaptive Network Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) supplemented by the use of reinforcement learning (RL) as a non-arbitrage algorithmic trading system. The novel intelligent trading system is capable of identifying a change in a primary trend for trading and investment decisions. It dynamically determines the periods for momentum and moving averages using the RL paradigm and also appropriately shifting the cycle using ANFIS-RL to address the delay in the predicted cycle. This is used as a proxy to determine the best point in time to go LONG and visa versa for SHORT. When this is coupled with a group of stocks, we derive a simple form of \"riding the cycles - waves\". These are the derived features of the underlying stock movement. It provides a learning framework to trade on cycles. Initial experimental results are encouraging. Firstly, the proposed framework is able to outperform DENFIS and RSPOP in terms of true error and correlation. Secondly, based on the test trading with five US stocks, the proposed trading system is able to beat the market by about 50 percentage points over a period of 13 years. \u00a9 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

    "Abstract": "Financial volatility refers to the intensity of the fluctuations in the expected return on an investment or the pricing of a financial asset due to market uncertainties. Hence, volatility modeling and forecasting is imperative to financial market investors, as such projections allow the investors to adjust their trading strategies in anticipation of the impending financial market movements. Following this, financial volatility trading is the capitalization of the uncertainties of the financial markets to realize investment profits in times of rising, falling and side-way market conditions. In this paper, an intelligent straddle trading system (framework) that consists of a volatility projection module (VPM) and a trade decision module (TDM) is proposed for financial volatility trading via the buying and selling of option straddles to help a human trader capitalizes on the underlying uncertainties of the Hong Kong stock market. Three different measures, namely: (1) the historical volatility (HV), (2) implied volatility (IV) and (3) model-based volatility (MV) of the Hang Seng Index (HSI) are employed to quantify the implicit volatility of the Hong Kong stock market. The TDM of the proposed straddle trading system combines the respective volatility measures with the well-established moving-averages convergence/divergence (MACD) principle to recommend trading actions to a human trader dealing in HSI straddles. However, the inherent limitation of the MACD trading rule is that it generates time-delayed trading signals due to the use of moving averages, which are essentially lagging trend indicators. This drawback is intuitively addressed in the proposed straddle trading system by applying the VPM to compute future projections of the volatility measures of the HSI prior to the activation of the TDM. The VPM is realized by a self-organising neural-fuzzy semantic network named the evolving fuzzy semantic memory (eFSM) model. As compared to existing statistical and computational intelligence based modeling techniques currently employed for financial volatility modeling and forecasting, eFSM possesses several desirable attributes such as: (1) an evolvable knowledge base to continuously address the non-stationary characteristics of the Hong Kong stock market; (2) highly formalized human-like information computations; and (3) a transparent structure that can be interpreted via a set of linguistic IF-THEN semantic fuzzy rules. These qualities provide added credence to the computed HSI volatility projections. The volatility modeling and forecasting performances of the eFSM, when benchmarked to several established modeling techniques, as well as the observed trading returns of the proposed straddle trading system, are encouraging. \u00a9 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

    "Abstract": "Traders make trade decisions specifying entry, exit, and stop loss prices. Technicians often decide on entry, exit, and stop loss prices based on a predefined set of technical rules. In this paper, we employ a method based on grammatical evolution to coevolve technical rules for entry, exit, and stop loss for trading a London Stock Exchange (LSE) based stock in high frequency. We consider the case of two class of investors with risk averse, and loss preferences and build a partial trading frontier given the preferences considered. The performance of the rules evolved is compared to a publicly available trading system called the turtle trading system (TTS) and the best rules produced by our method outperforms TTS.",

    "Abstract": "Options are highly non-linear and complicated products in financial markets. Owing to the high risk associated with option trading, investment on options is a knowledge-intensive industry. This study develops a novel decision support system for option trading. In the first stage, independent component analysis (ICA) is employed to uncover the independent hidden forces of the stock market that drive the price movement of an option. In the second stage, a dynamic kernel predictors are constructed for trading decisions. Comparing with convectional feature extractions and pure regression models, the performance improvement of the new method is significant and robust. The cumulated trading profits are substantialy increased. The resultant intelligent investment decision support system can help investors, fund managers and investment decision-makers make profitable decisions. \u00a9 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2010.",

    "Abstract": "The principle objective of this paper is to obtain trading rules with a low risk level which are also capable of obtaining high returns. To that purpose a methodology has been defined, based on the design of a genetic algorithm GAP and an incremental training technique adapted to the learning of series of stock market values. The GAP technique consists in a fusion of GP and GA. In GAP a chromosome is composed of a tree with language operators and a vector with numeric values. The GAP algorithm implements the automatic search for trading rules taking as objectives of the training both the optimization of the return obtained and the minimization of the assumed risk. In order to diminish high over-fitting, a technique of incremental training has been used. Applying the proposed methodology, rules have been obtained for a period of eight years of the S&P500 index. The achieved adjustment of the relation return-risk has generated rules with returns very superior in the testing period to those obtained applying habitual methodologies and even clearly superior to Buy&Hold.

    "Abstract": "Profitability of a trading system based on the momentum-like effects of asset price jumps was tested on four currency markets (EUR/USD, GBP/USD, USD/CHF and USD/JPY) and three futures markets (Light Crude Oil, E-Mini S&P 500 and VIX), on 7 frequencies (1-minute to 1-day), over a period of more than 20 years. The proposed trading system entered long and short trades in the direction of asset price jumps and held the positions for a fixed horizon, optimized on the in-sample period. The system achieved statistically significant out-sample profits for the USD/CHF, EUR/USD and GBP/USD exchange rates, especially on the 15-minute, 30-minute and 1-hour frequencies, with expected returns of up to 20\u201330% p.a., including transaction costs. On the 1-day frequency, on the USD/JPY and on the three analysed futures markets, only insignificant profits or losses were achieved. On the 1-minute frequency, the system ended with a loss for all of the assets. \u00a9 2019, University of Economics - Prague. All rights reserved.",

    "Abstract": "Automated trading is a novel field of study in which computer programs are put in charge of deciding when and how to trade financial instruments. Intelligent agents, with their ability to act autonomously and to adapt and interact with the environment, seem like an obvious choice for the development of automated trading systems. The aim of this article is to analyze how well intelligent agents suit this task. We implemented a set of autonomous currency trading agents, using an architecture that consists of an ensemble of classification and regression models, a case-based reasoning system and an expert system. A total of six trading agents were implemented, each being responsible for trading one of the following currency pair in the Forex market: EUR/USD, EUR/JPY, EUR/CHF, USD/JPY, USD/CHF and CHF/JPY. The agents simulated trades over a period of 23 months, having all achieved a reasonable profit trading independently. However, their strategies resulted in relatively high drawdows. In order to decrease the risk inherent to these high drawdowns, the same simulation was performed while making the agents share the monetary resources. As expected, this strategy of investment diversification originated better results. Still, when the trading costs were taken into consideration, the overall trading performance was less than impressive. That was due to the fact that each agent performed too many trades, and the cost associated with the trading commissions became prohibitively high. We were able to lessen the impact of the trading costs in the total profit by integrating the agents in a multi-agent system, in which the agents communicated with each other before opening new trades. This allowed them to calculate the intended exposure to the market, which in turn enabled them to avoid redundant trades. Under simulation and using low leverage, this multi-agent system obtained a 55.7% profit in 23 months of trading, with a 9.0% maximum drawdown. \u00a9 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",

    "Abstract": "This paper presents the threshold recurrent reinforcement learning (TRRL) model and describes its application in a simple automated trading system. The TRRL is a regime-switching extension of the recurrent reinforcement learning (RRL) algorithm. The basic RRL model was proposed by Moody and Wu (1997) and used for uncovering trading strategies. We argue that the RRL is not sufficiently equipped to capture the non-linearities and structural breaks present in financial data, and propose the TRRL model as a more suitable algorithm for such environments. This paper gives a detailed description of the TRRL and compares its performance with that of the basic RRL model in a simple automated trading framework using daily data from four well-known European indices. We assume a frictionless setting and use volatility as an indicator variable for switching between regimes. We find that the TRRL produces better trading strategies in all the cases studied, and demonstrate that it is more apt at finding structure in non-linear financial time series than the standard RRL. \u00a9 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",

    "Abstract": "We propose a multi-stock automated trading system that relies on a layered structure consisting of a machine learning algorithm, an online learning utility, and a risk management overlay. Alternating decision tree (ADT), which is implemented with Logitboost, was chosen as the underlying algorithm. One of the strengths of our approach is that the algorithm is able to select the best combination of rules derived from well-known technical analysis indicators and is also able to select the best parameters of the technical indicators. Additionally, the online learning layer combines the output of several ADTs and suggests a short or long position. Finally, the risk management layer can validate the trading signal when it exceeds a specified non-zero threshold and limit the application of our trading strategy when it is not profitable. We test the expert weighting algorithm with data of 100 randomly selected companies of the S & P 500 index during the period 2003-2005. We find that this algorithm generates abnormal returns during the test period. Our experiments show that the boosting approach is able to improve the predictive capacity when indicators are combined and aggregated as a single predictor. Even more, the combination of indicators of different stocks demonstrated to be adequate in order to reduce the use of computational resources, and still maintain an adequate predictive capacity. \u00a9 2010 Taylor & Francis.",

    "Abstract": "Recent technological and regulatory advances have coalesced to usher in an era where both automated and algorithmic trading routinely characterize a wealth maximization process managed by the continuous trading of equity securities. Under this approach to wealth maximization, automated trading focuses on the process determining directional trades for individual securities based upon the receipt and interpretation of new data. This paper presents a stochastic price formation algorithm that implements a cognitive decision making system modeled by twin radial basis function artificial neural networks to produce a high frequency automated trading system for individual equity securities listed on U.S. exchanges. The overall effectiveness and efficiency of the automated trading system is calibrated by estimating non-parametric quasi elasticity coefficients for individual firm fundamental characteristics. We find that automation driven by cognitive science can effectively auto-trade securities and produce changes to individual wealth that equals or exceeds the performance generated by a simple buy-and-hold strategy. We also identify four fundamental firm factors that explain the ability of the automated trading algorithm to produce a measured level of percent-positive trades. \u00a9 Izmir University of Economics, Turkey, 2010.",

    "Abstract": "The prediction of financial time series is a very complicated process. An initial look at financial time series gives the impression that they are random in nature. If true, this would make the forecast, and therefore the trading, of such series exceptionally difficult. The efficient market hypothesis states that the current price contains all available information in the market. This leads to the predictability of most financial time series as being a rather controversial issue. Experts have been forecasting and trading financial markets for decades, using their knowledge and expertise in recognizing patterns and interpreting current financial data. This paper extends the Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System to create an expert system that is capable of using fuzzy reasoning combined with the pattern recognition capability of neural networks to be used in financial forecasting and trading. The novelty of the approach lies in its application to the field of high frequency finance. Such an approach has not been used so far with high frequency trading or as a part of an automated trading strategy. This has produced an expert trading system which overcomes the physical limitations of human experts and traders in taking multiple decisions at extremely short time intervals. This means the system can perform predictions and trading decisions at a very high frequency using intra-day data. \u00a9 2009 IEEE.",

    "Abstract": "Statistical arbitrage refers to a class of algorithmic trading systems implementing data mining strategies. In this chapter we describe a computational framework for statistical arbitrage based on support vector regression. The algorithm learns the fair price of the security under management by minimining a regularized \u03b5-insensitive loss function in an on-line fashion, using the most recent market information acquired by means of streaming financial data. The difficult issue of adaptive learning in non-stationary environments is addressed by adopting an ensemble learning approach, where a meta-algorithm strategically combines the opinion of a pool of experts. Experimental results based on nearly seven years of historical data for the iShare S&P 500 ETF demonstrate that satisfactory risk-adjusted returns can be achieved by the data mining system even after transaction costs. \u00a9 2009 Springer US.",

    "Abstract": "In algorithmic trading applications, a large number of coevolving financial data streams are observed and analyzed. A recurrent and important task is to determine how a given stream depends on others, over time, accounting for dynamic dependence patterns and without imposing any probabilistic law governing this dependence. We demonstrate how Flexible Least Squares (FLS), a penalized version of ordinary least squares that accommodates for dynamic regression coefficients, can be deployed successfully in this context. We describe a market-neutral algorithmic trading system based on a combined use of on-line feature extraction and recursive regression. The system has been proved to perform successfully when trading the S&P 500 Futures Index. Copyright 2008 ACM.",

    "Abstract": "In practice, it is difficult to gain profit in the process of trading interest rate derivative commodities. This could be attributed to the complexity of existing pricing models, which are derived from the term structure and yield curve, both of which cannot adapt well to short-term market dynamics. In this study, we use the Extended Classifier System (XCS) to model the market behavior of interest rate futures, the purpose of which is to provide effective trading decision support. Several technical indicators and their first- and second-order derivatives are selected as the market descriptive variables, which are then used for XCS training. Finally, the adaptive rules of the classifiers, which consist of conditions with relative actions considered helpful for constructing the automatic trading system, are generated from the XCS knowledge discovery process. The market data of the 10-year government bond futures traded in Taiwan are chosen for empirical study to verify the accuracy and profitability of the XCS model. These were also used to conduct a comparative evaluation between the random walk and tendency following models and the XCS model. \u00a9 2008 IEEE.",

    "Abstract": "Portfolio management is a challenging task where humans have to make decisions under uncertainty. Since usually humans tend to avoid unknown risk, in general they don't maximize their utility function when managing a portfolio. This fact favours using an automated trading system for portfolio management. In this work, we propose an automated trading system using multiagent systems. We use fundamental and cluster analysis to select the stocks, and additionally we employ a financial distress prediction model to estimate companies financial health. We also optimize the portfolio for different investor's utility functions. Comparing our approach's results to a benchmark, we have obtained higher return values and lower risks; moreover, the approach was profitable even when we have added brokerage fees. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

    "Abstract": "Investment strategies are usually based on forecasting models, and these are optimized with respect to past predictive performance. However, the main goal of most investors is the optimization of a risk-adjusted performance measure, such as the well-known Sharpe index. This issue has been approached by a few different studies within the area of Neurocomputing. The present paper briefly describes and empirically compares some of the models and methods proposed in those studies. Such adaptive methods can be computationally demanding, and convergence to high-quality solutions can be difficult to achieve, yet they can be very useful in automated trading systems, namely for portfolio management. In particular, the Q-learning algorithm, when combined with neural networks for value function approximation, seems to be a reasonably competitive approach, although not overall superior to alternative ones. \u00a9 2005 Elsevier B.V.

    "Abstract": "This paper introduces adaptive reinforcement learning (ARL) as the basis for a fully automated trading system application. The system is designed to trade foreign exchange (FX) markets and relies on a layered structure consisting of a machine learning algorithm, a risk management overlay and a dynamic utility optimization layer. An existing machine-learning method called recurrent reinforcement learning (RRL) was chosen as the underlying algorithm for ARL. One of the strengths of our approach is that the dynamic optimization layer makes a fixed choice of model tuning parameters unnecessary. It also allows for a risk-return trade-off to be made by the user within the system. The trading system is able to make consistent gains out-of-sample while avoiding large draw-downs. \u00a9 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

    "Abstract": "Quantitative trading is an automated trading system in which the trading strategies and decisions are conducted by a set of mathematical models. Quantitative trading applies a wide range of computational approaches such as statistics, physics, or machine learning to analyze, predict, and take advantage of big data in finance for investment. This work studies core components of a quantitative trading system. Machine learning offers a number of important advantages over traditional algorithmic trading. With machine learning, multiple trading strategies are implemented consistently and able to adapt to real-time market. To demonstrate how machine learning techniques can meet quantitative trading, linear regression and support vector regression models are used to predict stock movement. In addition, multiple optimization techniques are used to optimize the return and control risk in trading. One common characteristic for both prediction models is they effectively performed in short-term prediction with high accuracy and return. However, in short-term prediction, the linear regression model is outperform compared to the support vector regression model. The prediction accuracy is considerably improved by adding technical indicators to dataset rather than adjusted price and volume. Despite the gap between prediction modeling and actual trading, the proposed trading strategy achieved a higher return than the S&P 500 ETF-SPY. \u00a9 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.",

    "Abstract": "For building an automatic trading system one needs: a significant variable for characterizing the financial asset behaviours; a suitable algorithm for finding out the information hidden in such a variable; and a proper Trading Strategy for transforming these information in operative indications. Starting from recent results proposed in literature, we have conjectured that the Technical Analysis approach could reasonably extract the information present in prices and volumes. Like tool able to find out the relation existing between the Technical Analysis inputs and an output we properly defined, we use the Group Method of Data Handling, a soft-computing approach which gives back a polynomial approximation of the unknown relationship between the inputs and the output. The automatic Trading Strategy we implement is able both to work in real-time and to return operative signals. The system we create in such a way not only performs pattern recognition, but also generates its own patterns. The results obtained during an intraday operating simulation on the US T-Bond futures is satisfactory, particularly from the point of view of the trend direction detection, and from the net profit standpoint. \u00a9 2002 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",

    "Abstract": "Successful stock traders have been using support-resistance lines for their trading decisions for decades. At the same time, correctly identifying these imaginary lines is one of the greatest challenges that they constantly face due to the complex and mostly inconsistent nature of this phenomenon. Still, these lines are considered among one of the most important technical indicators for designating buy-sell points. It is very difficult, if not impossible to determine the best support-resistance lines for any given stock; hence most of the time, the traders manually draw these imaginary lines on stock charts and implement their trading strategies accordingly. In this study, our aim is automatically identifying these lines through an evolutionary optimization algorithm (PSO) and using these support-resistance points for deciding the optimum buy-sell points. The proposed strategy is compared against Buy Hold. The results indicate using optimized support-resistance lines can be used for identifying buy-sell points, meanwhile if we only decide to use these automatically-generated lines, no significant improvement was observed when compared to Buy Hold strategy. However, this is a preliminary study and more analyses need to be performed. If the model is used as one of the multiple inputs to a more comprehensive trading system along with other technical/fundamental indicators, better results might be achieved. \u00a9 2019 IEEE.",

    "Abstract": "In this paper, we investigated the profitability of technical analysis as applied to the stock markets of the BRICS member nations. In addition, we searched for evidence that technical analysis and fundamental analysis can complement each other in these markets. To implement this research, we created a comprehensive portfolio containing the assets traded in the markets of each BRICS member. We developed an automated trading system that simulated transactions in this portfolio using technical analysis techniques. Our assessment updated the findings of previous research by including more recent data and adding South Africa, the latest member included in BRICS. Our results showed that the returns obtained by the automated system, on average, exceeded the value invested. There were groups of assets from each country that performed well above the portfolio average, surpassing the returns obtained using a buy and hold strategy. The returns from the sample portfolio were very strong in Russia and India. We also found that technical analysis can help fundamental analysis identify the most dynamic companies in the stock market. \u00a9 2018, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "We have previously described trading systems based on unsupervised learning approaches such as reinforcement learning and genetic algorithms which take as input a collection of commonly used technical indicators and generate profitable trading decisions from them. This article demonstrates the advantages of applying evolutionary algorithms to the reinforcement learning problem using a hybrid credit assignment approach. In earlier work, the temporal difference reinforcement learning approach suffered from problems with overfitting the in-sample data. This motivated the present approach. Technical analysis has been shown previously to have predictive value regarding future movements of foreign exchange prices and this article presents methods for automated high-frequency FX trading based on evolutionary reinforcement learning about signals from a variety of technical indicators. These methods are applied to GBPUSD, USDCHF and USDJPY exchange rates at various frequencies. Statistically significant profits are made consistently at transaction costs of up to 4bp for the hybrid system while the standard RL is only able to trade profitably up to about 1bp slippage per trade. \u00a9 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2002.",

    "Abstract": "Automated trading systems have been proved to be very helpful to traders and investors. However, most of the existing systems implemented with any statistical or neural network approaches are incapable to give accurate advice because they cannot capture the off-market information for which most of it is non-numeric. In this paper, an automated trading system which integrates the techniques from technical analysis, pattern recognition, and knowledge-based system is presented. The numeric data from the stock is processed by both the statistical method and feature extraction. The intermediate results are then used by the rule-based system which captures the off-market information in form of facts and rules. After that, the advice can be generated through the inference with the data stored in the database. For resolving the inconsistencies among the intermediate results from different components of the system. Concepts from the fuzzy set theories are employed. Further, some data from the past Hang Seng Index (HSI) is used for illustration.",

    "Abstract": "Pairs trading is a statistical arbitrage strategy, which selects a set of assets with similar performance and produces profits during these asset prices far away from rational equilibrium. Once this phenomenon exists, traders can earn the spread by longing the underperforming asset and shorting the outperforming asset. This paper proposed a novel intelligent high-frequency pairs trading system in Taiwan Stock Index Futures (TX) and Mini Index Futures (MTX) market based on deep learning techniques. This research utilized the improved time series visualization method to transfer historical volatilities with different time frames into 2D images which are helpful in capturing arbitrage signals. Moreover, this research improved convolutional neural networks (CNN) model by combining the financial domain knowledge and filterbank mechanism. We proposed Filterbank CNN to extract high-quality features by replacing the random-generating filters with the arbitrage knowledge filters. In summary, the accuracy is enhanced through the proposed method, and it proves that the integrated information technology and financial knowledge could create the better pairs trading system. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

    "Abstract": "Computational intelligence techniques for financial trading systems have always been quite popular. In the last decade, deep learning models start getting more attention, especially within the image processing community. In this study, we propose a novel algorithmic trading model CNN-TA using a 2-D convolutional neural network based on image processing properties. In order to convert financial time series into 2-D images, 15 different technical indicators each with different parameter selections are utilized. Each indicator instance generates data for a 15 day period. As a result, 15 \u00d7 15 sized 2-D images are constructed. Each image is then labeled as Buy, Sell or Hold depending on the hills and valleys of the original time series. The results indicate that when compared with the Buy & Hold Strategy and other common trading systems over a long out-of-sample period, the trained model provides better results for stocks and ETFs. \u00a9 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "In this paper a novel clustering-based system for automated stock market trading is introduced. It relies on interpolative Boolean algebra as underlying mathematical framework used to construct logical clustering method which is the central component of the system. The system uses fundamental analysis ratios, more precisely market valuation ratios, as clustering variables to differentiate between undervaluated and overvaluated stocks. To structure investment portfolio, the proposed system uses special weighting formulas which automatically diversify investment funds. Finally, a simple trading simulation engine is developed to test our system on real market data. The proposed system was tested on Belgrade Stock Exchange historical data and was able to achieve a high rate of return and to outperform the BelexLine market index as a benchmark variable. The paper has also provided in-depth analysis of the system\u2019s investment decision making process which reveals some exciting insights. \u00a9 2018, Strojarski Facultet. All Rights reserved.",

This article develops a method based on an automated trading system (ATS) applied to the Brazilian stock market, and investigates the relevance of small caps to the investor. The study indicates that, in the case of the Brazilian stock exchange, although there is a possibility of high returns the profitability of technical analysis of small caps is similar to strategies using blue chips. \u00a9 2018 Africagrowth Institute",

    "Abstract": "This paper presents an autonomous effective trading system devoted to the support of decision-making processes in the financial market domain. Genetic programming (GP) has been used effectively as an artificial intelligence technique in the financial field, especially for forecasting tasks in financial markets. In this paper, GP is employed as a means of automatically generating short-term trading rules on financial markets using technical indicators and fundamental parameters. The majority of forecasting tools use a fixed physical timescale, which makes the flow of price fluctuations discontinuous. Therefore, using a fixed physical timescale may expose investors to risks, due to their ignorance of some significant activities. Instead of using fixed timescales for this purpose, the trading rules are generated under a directional-change (DC) event framework. We examine the profitability of the trading systems for the Saudi Stock Exchange, and evaluate the GP forecasting performance under a DC framework through agent-based simulation market index trading. The performance of the forecasting model is compared with a number of benchmark forecasts, namely the buy-and-hold and technical analysis trading strategies. Our numerical results show that the proposed GP model under a DC framework significantly outperforms other traditional models based on fixed physical timescales in terms of portfolio return. \u00a9 2018 Infopro Digital Risk (IP) Limited.",

    "Abstract": "The chapter discusses algorithmic trading, which refers to any automated process, consisting of a number of interconnected components, whose main aim is to perform financial transactions of any kind. Its chief advantage lies in the fact that human intervention is minimized to an acceptable extent. This is quite desirable because nowadays numerous factors affect financial decisions. Financial managers are able to deal with a limited amount of information. There are many ways to implement algorithmic trading systems. This chapter aims to highlight the efficiency of biologically inspired methodologies when incorporated in such systems. Biologically inspired intelligence comprises a range of algorithms whose common philosophy is based on the behavior of real-world, natural systems and networks. What is more, the performance of the applied nature-inspired intelligence (NII) methodologies is compared to traditional benchmark approaches such as the random portfolio construction. \u00a9 Oxford University Press 2018.

    "Abstract": "This research seeks to design, implement, and test a fully automatic high-frequency trading system that operates on the Chilean stock market, so that it is able to generate positive net returns over time. A system that implements high-frequency trading (HFT) is presented through advanced computer tools as an NP-Complete type problem in which it is necessary to optimize the profitability of stock purchase and sale operations. The research performs individual tests of the algorithms implemented, reviewing the theoretical net return (profitability) that can be applied on the last day, month, and semester of real market data. Finally, the research determines which of the variants of the implemented system performs best, using the net returns as a basis for comparison. The use of particle swarm optimization as an optimization algorithm is shown to be an effective solution since it is able to optimize a set of disparate variables but is bounded to a specific domain, resulting in substantial improvement in the final solution. \u00a9 2018 Broderick Crawford et al.",

    "Abstract": "Trading the financial markets is a common idea nowadays. Millions of market participants, individuals, companies or public funds are buying and selling different equities in order to obtain profit from the buy and sell price difference. Once the equity was established, the main question marks are when to buy, when to sell and how long to keep the opened positions. This paper will present a mathematical model for the cyclicality of the price evolution. The model can be applied for any equity in any financial market, using any timeframe. The method will gives us information about when is good to buy and when is better to sell. The price cyclicality model is also a method to establish when the price is approaching to change its behavior in order to build limit conditions to stay away the market and to minimize the risk. The fundamental news is already included in the price behavior. Being exclusively a mathematical model based on the price evolution, this method can be easily implemented in algorithmic trading. The paper will also reveal how the cyclicality model can be applied in automated trading systems and will present comparative results obtained in real-time trading environment. \u00a9 2018, Bucharest University of Economic Studies.

The system made transactions on hourly closing prices with weekly parameters optimization period, using the d-Backtest PS method. Through the search and checking of the results, two findings for optimization of trading strategy were found. These findings with the order they were examined and are presented in this paper are as follows: (1) the simultaneous use of \"long and short\" positions, with different parameters in a hedging account, acts as a hedging strategy, minimizing losses, in relation to a \"long or short\" in a non-hedging account for the same time period and (2) there is weak correlation of past backtesting periods between the same systems, if they are configured for \"long and short\" trades, or for just \"long\" or for just \"short\". \u00a9 Dimitrios Th.

    "Abstract": "This study presents the implementation of an automated trading system that uses three critical analyses to determine time-decisions and portfolios for investment. The approach is based on a meta-grammatical evolution methodology that combines technical, fundamental and macroeconomic analysis on a hybrid top-down paradigm. First, the method provides a low-risk portfolio by analyzing countries and industries. Next, aiming to focus on the most robust companies, the system filters the portfolio by analyzing their economic variables. Finally, the system analyzes prices and volumes to optimize investment decisions during a given period. System validation involves a series of experiments in the European financial markets, which are reflected with a data set of over nine hundred companies. The final solutions have been compared with static strategies and other evolutionary implementations and the results show the effectiveness of the proposal. \u00a9 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",

    "Abstract": "In current times, trading success depends on choosing a correct strategy. Algorithmic trading is often based on technical analysis - an approach where the values of one or several technical indicators are translated into buy or sell signals. Thus, every trader's main challenge is the choice and use of the most fitting trading rules. In our work, we suggest an evolutionary algorithm for generating and selecting the most fitting trading rules for interday trading, which are presented in the form of binary decision trees. A distinctive feature of this approach is the interpretation of the evaluation of the current state of technical indicators with the help of dynamic ranges that are recalculated on a daily basis. This allows to create long-term trading rules. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this system for the Top-5 stocks of the United States IT sector and discuss the ways to improve it. \u00a9 2017 FRUCT.",

    "Abstract": "In this paper we propose and validate a trading rule based on flag pattern recognition, incorporating important innovations with respect to the previous research. Firstly, we propose a dynamic window scheme that allows the stop loss and take profit to be updated on a quarterly basis. In addition, since the flag pattern is a trend-following pattern, we have added the EMA indicator to filter trades. This technical analysis indicator is calculated both for 15-min and 1-day timeframes, which enables short and medium terms to be considered simultaneously. We also filter the flags according to the price range on which they are developed and have limited the maximum loss of each trade to 100 points. The proposed methodology was applied to 91,309 intraday observations of the DJIA index, considerably improving the results obtained in the previous proposals and those obtained by the buy & hold strategy, both for profitability and risk, and also after taking into account the transaction costs. These results seem to challenge market efficiency in line with other similar studies, in the specific analysis carried out on the DJIA index and is also limited to the setup considered. \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Nowadays, with the rapid development of information technology, many business fields gradually usher in the era of big data. Extracting valuable information from the large data is very urgent. However, because of some limitations such as memory restrictions, data complexity or time complexity, the majority of traditional data mining methods are time consuming and low efficiency working on big data. In contrast, parallel computing is a common and reliable choice to solve that problem. In this paper, we propose a fuzzy rule discovery algorithm - fuzzy rule based classification system in the framework of MapReduce (FRBCS-MR). The proposed FRBCS-MR algorithm applies parallel computing technology to extract fuzzy rules and build fuzzy rule-base, which combines the advantage of dealing with uncertainty of fuzzy system and the ability of MapReduce in parallel computing. Future goods trading has been gradually transformed from the original manual trading to stylized trading and the stylized trading is considered to be the forefront and the most scientific mode of investment. In the experimental studies, the rules extracted by FRBCS-MR algorithm using future goods data are turned into trading strategies which are to be used in the real automated trading platform TradeBlazer (TB) to compute the profit and loss situation. The result shows that the FRBCS-MR algorithm has good profit ability and possesses a certain guiding significance for investors. \u00a9 2017 Technical Committee on Control Theory, CAA.",

    "Abstract": "Many existing Algorithmic Trading Systems (ATS) use a large number of parameters to improve the results (i.e. accurate market forecasting and maximisation of profit). However, the use of superfluous parameters can often mask underlying trends leading to result instability and an excessive risk. This paper proposes a method for choosing the minimum number of parameters that are necessary and sufficient for the ATS to demonstrate a more reliable outcome. An ATS system is implemented and tested with the method and is shown to be successful for a number of case data scenarios. \u00a9 2017 IEEE.",

    "Abstract": "In this paper, a neural network-based stock price prediction and trading system using technical analysis indicators is presented. The model developed first converts the financial time series data into a series of buy-sell-hold trigger signals using the most commonly preferred technical analysis indicators. Then, a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) artificial neural network (ANN) model is trained in the learning stage on the daily stock prices between 1997 and 2007 for all of the Dow30 stocks. Apache Spark big data framework is used in the training stage. The trained model is then tested with data from 2007 to 2017. The results indicate that by choosing the most appropriate technical indicators, the neural net- work model can achieve comparable results against the Buy and Hold strategy in most of the cases. Furthermore, fine tuning the technical indicators and/or optimization strategy can enhance the overall trading performance. Copyright 2017 ACM.",

    "Abstract": "This paper describes a hybrid automated trading system (ATS) based on grammatical evolution and microeconomic analysis. The proposed system takes advantage from the flexibility of grammars for introducing and testing novel characteristics. The ATS introduces the self-generation of new technical indicators and multi-strategies for stopping unforeseen losses. Additionally, this work copes with a novel optimization method combining multi-objective optimization with a grammatical evolution methodology. We implemented the ATS testing three different fitness functions under three mono-objective approaches and also two multi-objective ATSs. Experimental results test and compare them to the Buy and Hold strategy and a previous approach, beating both in returns and in number of positive operations. In particular, the multi-objective approach demonstrated returns up to 20 in very volatile periods, proving that the combination of fitness functions is beneficial for the ATS. \u00a9 2017 IOS Press and the authors.

    "Abstract": "The development of computational intelligence based trading strategies for financial markets has been the focus of research over the last few years. To develop efficient and effective automated trading strategies, we need to understand the workings of the market and the patterns emerging as a result of the traders interactions. In this paper, we develop an adaptive Genetic Programming (GP) agent-based trading system under Intraday Seasonality Model (ISM), which is abbreviated as GP-ISM trading system. ISM is used for creating maps and visualizing the dynamic price evolution of the asset during the day. This new model permits the recognition of periodic patterns and seasonalities in the price time series and hence eliminates any unnecessary data input. We use a high-frequency dataset of historical price data from Saudi Stock Market, which enables us to run multiple market simulation runs and draw comparisons and conclusions for the developed trading strategies. The goal of our work is to develop automated computational intelligence-based strategies for real markets, and this study facilitates a more thorough understanding of a specific market's workings and constitutes the basis for further exploration into such strategies designed for the stock market. We evaluate the intelligence of the GP-ISM trading system through agent-based simulation market index trading. For comparison, we also include four other types of trading agents in this contest, namely, zero-intelligence agents, Buy-and-Hold agents, fundamental agents and technical analysis agents. As a result, GP-ISM performs the best, which provides a general framework for the further development of automated trading strategies and decision support systems. \u00a9 2017 IOS Press and the authors.

    "Abstract": "In Complex Event Processing (CEP), complex events are detected according to a set of rules that are defined by domain experts. However, it makes the reliability of the system decreased as dynamic changes occur in the domain environment or domain experts make mistakes. To address such problem, this study proposes a Sequence Clustering-based Automated Rule Generation (SCARG) that can automatically generate rules by mining decision-making history of domain experts based on sequence clustering and probabilistic graphical modeling. Furthermore, based on a two-way learning approach, the proposed method is able to support automated regular or occasional rule updates. It makes self-adaptive CEP system possible by combining the rule generation method and the existing dynamic CEP systems. This technique is verified by establishing an automated stock trading system, and the performance of the system is measured in terms of the rate of return. The study solves the aforementioned problems and shows excellent results with an increase of 19.32% in performance when compared to the existing dynamic CEP technique. \u00a9 2016 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "This is an introductory work to the field of automatizing futures markets, related to commodities, so far operated by human traders. First, we build a mathematical framework for a futures market with many producers and consumers represented by automated traders in the market platform. Then we suggest an automatic trading strategy for the automatons. This strategy takes into account the forecasts of supply and demand streams as well as the evolution of nominal price. Later, we recall a set of analytical criteria used to measure the performance of a trading strategy. Next, we illustrate our approach by showing a price pattern generated by the automatic strategy and calculate its performances. Finally, we exhibit a heuristic based on simulation allowing to compute a quasi-optimal parameters matrix for this automatic trading system. \u00a9 2017 by IGI Global. All rights reserved.",

    "Abstract": "Many technical indicators have been selected as input variables in order to develop an automated trading system that determines buying and selling trading decision using optimal trading rules within the futures market. However, optimal technical trading rules alone may not be sufficient for real-world application given the endlessly changing futures market. In this study, a rule change trading system (RCTS) that consists of numerous trading rules generated using rough set analysis is developed in order to cover diverse market conditions. To change the trading rules, a rule change mechanism based on previous trading results is proposed. Simultaneously, a genetic algorithm is employed with the objective function of maximizing the payoff ratio to determine the thresholds of market timing for both buying and selling in the futures market. An empirical study of the proposed system was conducted in the Korea Composite Stock Price Index 200 (KOSPI 200) futures market. The proposed trading system yields profitable results as compared to both the buy-and-hold strategy, and a system not utilizing a genetic algorithm for maximizing the payoff ratio. \u00a9 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

    "Abstract": "We study trading systems using reinforcement learning with three newly proposed methods to maximize total profits and reflect real financial market situations while overcoming the limitations of financial data. First, we propose a trading system that can predict the number of shares to trade. Specifically, we design an automated system that predicts the number of shares by adding a deep neural network (DNN) regressor to a deep Q-network, thereby combining reinforcement learning and a DNN. Second, we study various action strategies that use Q-values to analyze which action strategies are beneficial for profits in a confused market. Finally, we propose transfer learning approaches to prevent overfitting from insufficient financial data. We use four different stock indices\u2014the S&P500, KOSPI, HSI, and EuroStoxx50\u2014to experimentally verify our proposed methods and then conduct extensive research. The proposed automated trading system, which enables us to predict the number of shares with the DNN regressor, increases total profits by four times in S&P500, five times in KOSPI, 12 times in HSI, and six times in EuroStoxx50 compared with the fixed-number trading system. When the market situation is confused, delaying the decision to buy or sell increases total profits by 18% in S&P500, 24% in KOSPI, and 49% in EuroStoxx50. Further, transfer learning increases total profits by twofold in S&P500, 3 times in KOSPI, twofold in HSI, and 2.5 times in EuroStoxx50. The trading system with all three proposed methods increases total profits by 13 times in S&P500, 24 times in KOSPI, 30 times in HSI, and 18 times in EuroStoxx50, outperforming the market and the reinforcement learning model. \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Recurrent reinforcement learning (RRL) has been found to be a successful machine learning technique for building financial trading systems. In this paper, we use a genetic algorithm (GA) to improve the trading results of a RRL-type equity trading system. The proposed trading system takes the advantage of GA\u2019s capability to select an optimal combination of technical indicators, fundamental indicators and volatility indicators for improving out-of-sample trading performance. In our experiment, we use the daily data of 180 S&P stocks (from the period January 2009 to April 2014) to examine the profitability and the stability of the proposed GA-RRL trading system. We find that, after feeding the indicators selected by the GA into the RRL trading system, the out-of-sample trading performance improves as the number of companies with a significantly positive Sharpe ratio increases. \u00a9 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",

    "Abstract": "This paper introduces a new probabilistic graphical model called gated Bayesian network (GBN). This model evolved from the need to represent processes that include several distinct phases. In essence, a GBN is a model that combines several Bayesian networks (BNs) in such a manner that they may be active or inactive during queries to the model. We use objects called gates to combine BNs, and to activate and deactivate them when predefined logical statements are satisfied. In this paper we also present an algorithm for semi-automatic learning of GBNs. We use the algorithm to learn GBNs that output buy and sell decisions for use in algorithmic trading systems. We show how the learnt GBNs can substantially lower risk towards invested capital, while they at the same time generate similar or better rewards, compared to the benchmark investment strategy buy-and-hold. We also explore some differences and similarities between GBNs and other related formalisms. \u00a9 2015 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Gated Bayesian networks (GBNs) are an extension of Bayesian networks that aim to model systems that have distinct phases. In this paper, we aim to use GBNs to output buy and sell decisions for use in algorithmic trading systems. These systems may have several parameters that require tuning, and assessing the performance of these systems as a function of their parameters cannot be expressed in closed form, and thus requires simulation. Bayesian optimisation has grown in popularity as a means of global optimisation of parameters where the objective function may be costly or a black box. We show how algorithmic trading using GBNs, supported by Bayesian optimisation, can lower risk towards invested capital, while at the same time generating similar or better rewards, compared to the benchmark investment strategy buy-and-hold.",

    "Abstract": "In 1997, Moody and Wu presented recurrent reinforcement learning (RRL) as a viable machine learning method within algorithmic trading. Subsequent research has shown a degree of controversy with regards to the benefits of incorporating technical indicators in the recurrent reinforcement learning framework. In 1991, Nison introduced Japanese candlesticks to the global research community as an alternative to employing traditional indicators within the technical analysis of financial time series. The literature accumulated over the past two and a half decades of research contains conflicting results with regards to the utility of using Japanese candlestick patterns to exploit inefficiencies in financial time series. In this paper, we combine features based on Japanese candlesticks with recurrent reinforcement learning to produce a high-frequency algorithmic trading system for the E-mini S&P 500 index futures market. Our empirical study shows a statistically significant increase in both return and Sharpe ratio compared to relevant benchmarks, suggesting the existence of exploitable spatio-Temporal structure in Japanese candlestick patterns and the ability of recurrent reinforcement learning to detect and take advantage of this structure in a high-frequency equity index futures trading environment. \u00a9 2015 IEEE.",

    "Abstract": "We report successful results from using deep learning neural networks (DLNNs) to learn, purely by observation, the behavior of profitable traders in an electronic market closely modelled on the limit-order-book (LOB) market mechanisms that are commonly found in the real-world global financial markets for equities (stocks shares), currencies, bonds, commodities, and derivatives. Successful real human traders, and advanced automated algorithmic trading systems, learn from experience and adapt over time as market conditions change; our DLNN learns to copy this adaptive trading behavior. A novel aspect of our work is that we do not involve the conventional approach of attempting to predict time-series of prices of tradeable securities. Instead, we collect large volumes of training data by observing only the quotes issued by a successful sales-trader in the market, details of the orders that trader is executing, and the data available on the LOB (as would usually be provided by a centralized exchange) over the period that the trader is active. In this paper we demonstrate that suitably configured DLNNs can learn to replicate the trading behavior of a successful adaptive automated trader, an algorithmic system previously demonstrated to outperform human traders. We also demonstrate that DLNNs can learn to perform better (i.e., more profitably) than the trader that provided the training data. We believe that this is the first ever demonstration that DLNNs can successfully replicate a human-like, or super-human, adaptive trader operating in a realistic emulation of a real-world financial market. Our results can be considered as proof-of-concept that a DLNN could, in principle, observe the actions of a human trader in a real financial market and over time learn to trade equally as well as that human trader, and possibly better. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

    "Abstract": "This paper proposes a performance-driven gradient boosting model (pdGBM) which predicts short-horizon price movements by combining nonlinear response functions of selected predictors. This model performs gradient descent in a constrained functional space by directly minimizing loss functions customized with different trading performance measurements. To demonstrate its practical applications, a simple trading system was designed with trading signals constructed from pdGBM predictions and fixed holding period in each trade. We tested this trading system on the high-frequency data of SPDR S&P 500 index ETF (SPY). In the out-of-sample period, it generated an average of 0.045% return per trade and an annualized Sharpe ratio close to 20 after transaction costs. Various empirical results also showed the model robustness to different parameters. These superior performances confirm the predictability of short-horizon price movements in the US equity market. We also compared the performance of this trading system with similar trading systems based on other predictive models like the gradient boosting model with L2 loss function and the penalized linear model. Results showed that pdGBM substantially outperformed all other models by higher returns in each month of the testing period. Additionally, pdGBM has many advantages including its capability of automatic predictor selection and nonlinear pattern recognition, as well as its simply structured and interpretable output function. \u00a9 2015 Taylor & Francis.",

    "Abstract": "Seasonality effects and empirical regularities in financial data have been well documented in the financial economics literature for over seven decades. This paper proposes an expert system that uses novel machine learning techniques to predict the price return over these seasonal events, and then uses these predictions to develop a profitable trading strategy. While simple approaches to trading these regularities can prove profitable, such trading leads to potential large drawdowns (peak-to-trough decline of an investment measured as a percentage between the peak and the trough) in profit. In this paper, we introduce an automated trading system based on performance weighted ensembles of random forests that improves the profitability and stability of trading seasonality events. An analysis of various regression techniques is performed as well as an exploration of the merits of various techniques for expert weighting. The performance of the models is analysed using a large sample of stocks from the DAX. The results show that recency-weighted ensembles of random forests produce superior results in terms of both profitability and prediction accuracy compared with other ensemble techniques. It is also found that using seasonality effects produces superior results than not having them modelled explicitly. \u00a9 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

    "Abstract": "The construction of automated financial trading systems (FTSs) is a subject of high interest for both the academic environment and the financial one due to the potential promises by self-learning methodologies. In this paper we consider Reinforcement Learning (RL) type algorithms, that is algorithms that real-time optimize their behavior in relation to the responses they get from the environment in which they operate, without the need for a supervisor. In particular, first we introduce the essential aspects of RL which are of interest for our purposes, second we present some original automatic FTSs based on differently configured RL-based algorithms, then we apply such FTSs to artificial and real time series of daily stock prices. Finally, we compare our FTSs with a classical one based on Technical Analysis indicators. All the results we achieve are generally quite satisfactory. \u00a9 Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.",

    "Abstract": "In the last few years, the financial industry has witnessed a growing demand for an integrated multi-asset, multi-strategy trading system that allows traders to simultaneously trade different types of assets, and provides real-time risk assessments, status, and performance of the diversified portfolio. However, many factors contribute to the complexity of developing such integrated decision-making systems. Some of these factors include: the inherent diversity of financial assets, the heterogeneity of trading and risk assessment strategies, and the highly dynamic nature of financial markets. Moreover, the large volume of data to be analyzed severely affects the system's ability to make timely decisions, especially, for high-frequency trading. This paper proposes a novel Holonic Intelligent Multi-Agent Algorithmic Trading System (HIMAATS) to address the software functional requirements (multi-asset, multi-strategy, real-time risk assessment, etc.), and non-functional requirements (autonomy, high-throughput, low-latency, modularity, scalability, etc.).

    "Abstract": "Automated trading, which is also known as algorithmic trading, is a method of using a predesigned computer program to submit a large number of trading orders to an exchange. It is substantially a real-time decision-making system which is under the scope of Enterprise Information System (EIS). With the rapid development of telecommunication and computer technology, the mechanisms underlying automated trading systems have become increasingly diversified. Considerable effort has been exerted by both academia and trading firms towards mining potential factors that may generate significantly higher profits. In this paper, we review studies on trading systems built using various methods and empirically evaluate the methods by grouping them into three types: technical analyses, textual analyses and high-frequency trading. Then, we evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of each method and assess their future prospects. \u00a9 2018, \u00a9 2018 The Author(s).

    "Abstract": "Professional fund managers, investment banks and regulatory authorities raise the question about the impact of algorithmic trading on trading businesses, economy and market efficiency. The questions rise if high frequency trading (HFT) provides more efficient, liquid markets and is economically beneficial. In this paper an algorithm based on statistical arbitrage is tested. Statistical arbitrage is a well-known trading strategy where profit arises from pricing inefficiencies between correlated financial instruments. An algorithm of statistical arbitrage tries to find a pair of correlated instruments that move together and take long/short positions when they diverge abnormally, hoping that the prices will converge in the near future. Recent computational expansion in financial modeling and the ever increasing demand for order execution speed is moving market making and price discovery strategies into high frequency trading (HFT) or the milliseconds realm, where HFT already generates nearly 2/3 of the overall trading volume. In this report we apply high frequency data from NYMEX exchange to test a trading system based on statistical arbitrage in one of the most liquid futures market, i.e. natural gas futures. The overall results suggest that statistical arbitrage in HFT environment significantly outperforms traditional trading strategies, provides liquidity to the markets and denies the efficient market hypothesis. \u00a9 Vilnius University, 2002-2014 \u00a9 Brno University of Technology, 2002-2014 \u00a9 University of Latvia, 2002-2014.",

    "Abstract": "Recurrent reinforcement learning (RRL) is a machine learning algorithm which has been proposed by researchers for constructing financial trading platforms. When an analysis of RRL trading performance is conducted using low frequency financial data (e.g. daily data), the weakening autocorrelation in price changes may lead to a decrease in trading profits as compared to its applications in high frequency trading. There therefore is a need to improve RRL for the purposes of daily equity trading. This paper presents two parameter update schemes (the 'average elitist' and the 'multiple elitist') for RRL. The purpose of the first scheme is to improve out-of-sample performance of RRL-type trading systems. The second scheme aims to exploit serial dependence in stock returns to improve trading performance, when traders deal with highly correlated stocks. Profitability and stability of the trading system are examined by using four groups of S&P stocks for the period January 2009 to December 2012. It is found that the Sharpe ratios of the stocks increase after we use the two parameter update schemes in the RRL trading system. \u00a9 2014 IEEE.",

    "Abstract": "In this paper, we present steps towards a model-driven financial decision support system (FDSS) to pricing options on currency futures, which can be embedded in a high-frequency trading process. Due to the difficulty of option valuation, we provide an alternative heuristic option pricing approach with neural networks. We show that the use of neural networks is not only suitable in generating accurate trading signals, but also in generating automated fast run-time trading signals for the decision taker. To achieve this, we conduct an experiment with an empirical tick data set of EUR/USD options on currency futures of four weeks. An essential advantage of our approach is the simultaneous pricing across different strike prices and parsimonious use of input variables. Nevertheless, we also have to take particular limitations into account, which give us useful hints for further research and steps. Copyright \u00a9 2014 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",
