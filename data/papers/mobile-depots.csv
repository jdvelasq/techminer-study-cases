However, most decision support models in location studies of consolidation facilities are limited to numerical computation or multi-criteria analysis while ignoring spatial factors in location selection. This study aims to characterise suitable locations for an inner-city consolidation facility based on spatial aspects, operational requirements, and societal concerns. Accordingly, this study presents an integrated spatial multi-criteria location framework to identify and rank optimal sites for a proposed freight consolidation facility in an inner-city area using 11 decision criteria identified from key stakeholders. Real geographic data from Inner Melbourne, Australia, are used to identify 20 candidate sites which are then evaluated and ranked using the TOPSIS method. The suitability analysis confirms that the most suitable locations are in zones with affordable industrial land with excellent accessibility to major roads and goods receivers. Sensitivity analysis indicates that assigning more significance to the operational requirements and decreasing the priority weight for proximity to residential areas tip favourability towards areas with low real estate costs and more industrially-zoned parts. The multi-criteria spatial modelling allows decision-makers and transport researchers to apply value-decisions at the onset of the process, and it also allows for improved understanding and visualisation of the results and of the significance of the chosen criteria in the evaluation process. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Inner-city; Last Mile Delivery; Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM); Spatial Analysis; Stakeholder Engagement; Urban Consolidation Center","Decision making; Decision support systems; Sensitivity analysis; Decision criterions; Decision support models; Freight consolidations; Melbourne , Australia; Multi Criteria Analysis; Numerical computations; Operational requirements; Suitability analysis; Location; decision making; freight transport; inner city area; multicriteria analysis; spatial data; stakeholder; transportation planning; Australia; Melbourne; Victoria [Australia]","Aljohani, K., Thompson, R.G., Optimizing the Establishment of a Central City Transshipment Facility to Ameliorate Last‐Mile Delivery: a Case Study in Melbourne CBD (2018) City Logistics 3: Towards Sustainable and Liveable Cities, pp. 23-46. , Eiichi Taniguchi Eiichi Thompson John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

The methodology was a multiple case study approach, comparing cases in Sweden and Scotland, two countries that are more/less advanced in their approach to UFT policy. The key finding reveals that while UFT policies such as time window restrictions can support successful UCCs, they cannot be considered in isolation from the collaborative UFT policy setting established by the local authority. A successful development also requires a commitment to financially support the UCC over at least the medium term, allowing time for the system to mature and collaborative service offerings to be developed. The findings of this study can be used by local authorities to establish a supportive UFT policy setting, as well as specifically designing policy packages in conjunction with UCC business models. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","collaboration; logistics; policy; urban consolidation centre; Urban freight transport",,"Aastrup, J., Gammelgaard, B., Prockl, G., (2012), 3PL Services City Logistics: A User’s Perspective.

In this paper, we propose a methodology for evaluating the performance of a parcel distribution network in city logistics. This methodology encompasses the main entities of a two-tier distribution system made up of carriers, huge shopping centers (multi-tenant buildings) and intermediate depots (urban consolidation centers), as well as the parcel flows between them. This methodology aims to optimize the transport flows (distance traveled) of a given distribution network while also quantifying the impact in terms of sustainable development by measuring gas emissions. Two different states of the network with different connectivity degrees are evaluated and compared: the current state of the network as well as its future state. The transport network modeling is based on a network flow, which is expressed in linear programming and implemented with an optimization solver. The validation of this methodology is based on the parcel distribution of the Multi-tenant Buildings of the city of Tokyo. The findings are that the network with greater connectivity between the entities brings significant traveled distance reduction as well as a reduction of emissions of CO2. Another finding is that the grouping of the parcels (i.e., pooling) brings a reduction of the distance traveled compared to the transport organization without grouping and contributes to a reduction in the number of trucks. © 2020 by the author.","City logistics; Freight distribution network; Linear programming; Multi-tenant buildings; Network flow problem; Urban consolidation centers","building; distribution system; flow modeling; methodology; optimization; sustainability; urban area; Tokyo","Taniguchi, E., Thompson, R.G., Yamada, T., New opportunities and challenges for city logistics (2016) Transp.

The specificity of such logistics and the multiple limitations led to particular solutions. However, they all share one common feature-the flow consolidation in different variants. This study considers the flow consolidation at the boundary of urban congested areas, through horizontal collaboration between logistic platforms. This way, the urban distribution centers (UDCs) receive all the goods according to the orders addressed to each producer (or group in case of ""on-going consolidations""). Deliveries are addressed to a single logistic platform. Thus, the flow consolidation is achieved. Each logistic platform receives part of the consumer goods intended for commercialization, but through collaboration between them (freight exchanges), all the warehouses of the producers have all the ordered goods. Dedicated management of logistics platforms and warehouses within each UDC ensures the confidentiality of distributor data. Three scenarios are presented concerning the same pattern of flow addressed to each UDC. These scenarios differ by the accessibility of the logistics platforms and by the connection between them (due to infrastructure development). The methodology of choosing the variants for composing the flow sent from each logistics platform considered the minimization of transfer times to UDC warehouses. Synthetic indicators allow for comparison between the analyzed scenarios. © 2020 by the authors.","Collaborative logistics; Flow consolidation schemes; Urban distribution centers","accessibility; commercialization; consolidation; freight transport; logistics; planning method; traffic congestion; urban area","Taniguchi, E., Thompson, R.T., Yamada, T., New Opportunities and Challenges for City Logistics (2016) Transp.

The amount of successful UCCs in the long run were, and are, very scarce, though. Little is published on the practical issues and experiences of running a UCC and offering UCC-services. In the Netherlands, Binnenstadservice (BSS) has run UCCs and UCC services for over a decade now. This contribution discusses development and the experiences of running a UCC in practice in the form of seven lessons, including the evolvement of the business model and organisation model, as well as the development from offering 'only' the cross-dock of physical flows, to that of the full triple cross-dock, including financial and information flows. Next, UCCs can be the answer to future challenges, such as zero emission city logistics and fit perfectly into the Physical Internet vision. © 2020 The Authors.

However, such operations cause several problems such as traffic congestion and environmental deterioration. Urban Consolidation Centers (UCC) are logistic platforms aiming to rationalize goods distribution by minimizing the above impacts, satisfying at the same time stakeholders’ interests, such as public authorities, supply chain stakeholders (retailers, carriers and suppliers), consumers and civilians. This paper proposes establishment of a UCC in the vicinity of the city of Volos, where trucks unload their cargo and cross-docking activities take place before goods are directed to the urban area for final distribution. Urban distribution is undertaken by green vehicles, which are assumed to replace conventional delivery trucks, in order to reduce operational costs and impacts in the city from urban distribution movements. As Volos is a medium sized city, delivery of goods by cargo bikes and green vehicles is foreseen. Traffic and system performance impacts that result from the operation of the new system are compared with the case before the UCC establishment. All impacts are combined in a sole index (Logistics Sustainability Index) which comprises the comparison of the two cases. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.","Impact assessment; Social cost benefit analysis; Sustainability disciplines; Sustainability enablers",,"Taniguchi, E., Kakimoto, Y., Modelling effects of e-commerce on urban freight transport (2004) Logistics Systems for Sustainable Cities, pp. 135-146. , https://doi.org/10.1108/9780080473222-010, Emerald Group Publishing Limited; Clos, J., (2016) Urbanization and Development.

Determining the location of the logistics center is an important decision regarding cost and benefit analysis. A three-stage methodology has been applied for presenting a framework for logistics center location selection in the context of Kayseri’s logistics development plan. The first stage includes the determination of criteria through literature review and interviews with experts. The second stage includes the weighting of determined criteria using linear BWM (best–worst method). The third stage includes the ranking of locations using the evaluation based on distance from average solution (EDAS) method with different distance measures. Our proposed methodology BWM–EDAS and also EDAS with different distance measures, which are applied for the first time in the literature, provides helpful findings to rank the logistics center locations. Lastly, sensitivity analysis is conducted to validate the robustness. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","BWM; City logistics centers; Distance measures; EDAS; Location selection; Sensitivity analysis","Cost benefit analysis; Decision making; Sensitivity analysis; City logistics; Cost and benefit analysis; Distance measure; EDAS; Literature reviews; Location selection; Logistics development; Multi criteria decision making; Location","Awasthi, A., Chauhan, S.S., Goyal, S.K., A multi-criteria decision making approach for location planning for urban distribution centers under uncertainty (2011) Math Comput Modell, 53 (1), pp. 98-109; Bamyacı, M., (2008) Modern Lojistik Yönetimi: Organize Lojistik Bölgeleri için Bir Yer Seçimi Modeli, , İstanbul Üniversitesi Fen Bilimleri Enstitüsü, Doktora Tezi; Cha, S.H., Taxonomy of nominal type histogram distance measures (2008) City, 1 (2), p. 1; Chen, C.T., A fuzzy approach to select the location of the distribution center (2001) Fuzzy Sets Syst, 118 (1), pp. 65-73; Chen, B., Wang, B., Location selection of logistics center in e-commerce network environments (2017) Am J Neural Netw Appl, 3 (4), p. 40; Chen, K.H., Liao, C.N., Wu, L.C., A selection model to logistic centers based on TOPSIS and MCGP methods: the case of airline industry (2014) J Appl Math, 2014, pp. 1-10; Elgün, M.N., Ulusal Ve Uluslararasi Taşima Ve Ticarette Lojistik Köylerin Yapilanma Esaslari Ve Uygun Kuruluş Yeri Seçimi (2011) Afyon Kocatepe Üniversitesi İktisadi ve İdari Bilimler Fakültesi Dergisi, 13 (2), pp. 203-226; Erkayman, B., Gundogar, E., Akkaya, G., Ipek, M., A fuzzy TOPSIS approach for logistics center location selection (2011) J Bus Case Stud, 7 (3), p. 49; Ghorabaee, M.K., Amiri, M., Zavadskas, E.K., Turskis, Z., Multi-criteria group decision-making using an extended EDAS method with interval type-2 fuzzy sets (2017) E + M Ekon Manag, 20 (1), p. 48; Ghorabaee, M.K., Amiri, M., Zavadskas, E.K., Turskis, Z., Antucheviciene, J., A new multi-criteria model based on interval type-2 fuzzy sets and EDAS method for supplier evaluation and order allocation with environmental considerations (2017) Comput Ind Eng, 112, pp. 156-174; Hong, L., Xiaohua, Z., Study on location selection of multi-objective emergency logistics center based on AHP (2011) Proced Eng, 15, pp. 2128-2132; Kahraman, C., Keshavarz Ghorabaee, M., Zavadskas, E.K., Cevik Onar, S., Yazdani, M., Oztaysi, B., Intuitionistic fuzzy EDAS method: an application to solid waste disposal site selection (2017) J Environ Eng Landsc Manag, 25 (1), pp. 1-12; Kayikci, Y., A conceptual model for intermodal freight logistics centre location decisions (2010) Proced Soc Behav Sci, 2 (3), pp. 6297-6311; Keshavarz Ghorabaee, M., Zavadskas, E.K., Olfat, L., Turskis, Z., Multi-criteria inventory classification using a new method of evaluation based on distance from average solution (EDAS) (2015) Informatica, 26 (3), pp. 435-451; Keshavarz Ghorabaee, M., Zavadskas, E.K., Olfat, L., Turskis, Z., Multi-criteria inventory classification using a new method of evaluation based on distance from average solution (EDAS) (2015) Informatica, 26 (3), pp. 435-451; Kuo, M.S., Optimal location selection for an international distribution center by using a new hybrid method (2011) Expert Syst Appl, 38 (6), pp. 7208-7221; Li, Y., Liu, X., Chen, Y., Selection of logistics center location using Axiomatic Fuzzy Set and TOPSIS methodology in logistics management (2011) Expert Syst Appl, 38 (6), pp. 7901-7908; Li, Y.Y., Wang, J.Q., Wang, T.L., A linguistic neutrosophic multi-criteria group decision-making approach with EDAS method (2019) Arab J Sci Eng, 44 (3), pp. 2737-2749; Mi, X., Tang, M., Liao, H., Shen, W., Lev, B., The state-of-the-art survey on integrations and applications of the best worst method in decision making: why, what, what for and what’s next?

The rising number of initiatives to establish and operate urban consolidation centers and their low success rates signal the need for better mechanisms to manage cooperation in this context. We introduce and study cooperative situations comprising a set of carriers with time sensitive deliveries who can consolidate their cargo to obtain savings. We introduce the class of Dispatch Consolidation (DC) games and search for ways to fairly allocate the obtained savings among the participating carriers. When delivery capacities are not restrictive, i.e. when waiting costs trigger truck dispatches, we show that stable allocations in the core always exist and can, in their entirety, be found by solving a compact linear program. With restrictive capacities, however, the core of a DC game may become empty. We introduce the notion of component-wise core for DC games to preserve stability first and foremost among the carriers whose deliveries are dispatched together in the chosen optimal solutions. The novelty of our approach is to link the stability requirements of an allocation rule with the structure of selected solutions for the underlying optimization problems. We characterize the component-wise cores of DC games, prove their non-emptiness, and suggest proportionally calculated allocations therein. Finally, we discuss a refinement of component-wise core allocations that minimizes envy among the carriers who are dispatched separately. © 2019 The Author(s)","Core; Gain-sharing; Game theory; Last mile logistics; Urban consolidation centers","Game theory; Linear programming; Trucks; Core; Gain-sharing; Last mile; Less-than-truckload; Logistical infrastructure; Optimization problems; Stability requirements; Urban consolidation; Wages","Allen, J., Browne, M., Woodburn, A., Leonardi, J., The role of urban consolidation centres in sustainable freight transport (2012) Transport Reviews, 32 (4), pp. 473-490; (2019), https://www.arup.com/projects/regent-street-delivery-and-servicing-reduction-scheme, ARUP.

The use of an urban distribution centre (UDC) is a solution to minimise these impacts. This paper compares the operational, economic, social, cultural, and environmental aspects that influence the implementation of a UDC in a Brazilian historical city, considering the viewpoints of the agents: residents, retailers and carriers. Having a more complete picture of these aspects by the agents, this paper also sheds light on corporate social responsibility (CSR) in urban freight transport (UFT). A survey was developed with each agent. Factor analysis is used to find the factors for implementation of a UDC and the Structural Equivalence by Orthogonal Procrustes Rotation is used to compare the factors. The findings reveal different points of view for these agents. Residents attached greater importance to factors related to habitability and sustainability in the city. Retailers focused on economic environmental issues, while carriers emphasised operational and environmental aspects. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Corporate social responsibility; Multivariate statistical analysis; Urban distribution centre; Urban freight transport agents",,"Agrebi, M., Abed, M., Omri, M.N., Urban distribution centers' location selection's problem: A survey (2015) Proceedings of the IEEE international conference on advanced logistics and transport, 4, pp. 246-251. , ICALT; Allen, J., Browne, M., Woodburn, A., Leonardi, J., The role of urban consolidation centres in sustainable freight transport (2012) Transport Reviews, 32 (4), pp. 473-490; Allen, G., Tanner, G., Browne, M., Anderson, S., Christodoulou, G., Jones, P., Modelling policy measures and company initiatives for sustainable urban distribution.

Economic efficiency and environment friendliness criteria were used to evaluate the sustainability of UCC. The results proved that the implementation of UCC as a sustainable city logistics scheme is efficient in reducing 8% of the total delivery cost for freight carrier and reducing 36% of the total emissions released to the environment. It is also showed that the use of learning agents is essential to demonstrate the successful implementation of the UCC, as it is only in the learning-based simulation, UCC operator could get a profit. Our simulation analysis also confirmed that compared to widely used reinforced learning algorithms (Q-learning), MAS-ADP brought increased accuracy to the evaluations' outcomes of UCC. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.

The high costs often prevent attracting a sufficient number of UCC users. In this paper, we study sustainable business models and the supporting role of administrative policies. We perform an agent-based simulation applied to the city of Copenhagen and collect data from a variety of sources to model the agents. Both the data and case setup are validated by means of expert interviews. We test 1,458 schemes that combine several administrative measures and cost settings. Most schemes yield significant environmental benefits; many of them reduce the truck kilometers driven by about 65% and emissions by about 70%. The key challenge is to identify schemes that are also financially sustainable. We show the importance of committing carriers to the UCC as soon as possible, as carriers potentially generate the bulk of the revenue. Subsequent revenues may be generated by offering value-adding services to receivers. Based on the numerical experiments, we pose various propositions that aid in providing favorable conditions for a UCC, improving its chances of long-term success. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

The paper’s objective, using a diffusion of innovations (DOI) theory is to understand antecedent factors for UCC adoption (or not). Data collection consisted of observation of the Bristol-Bath UCC operation and semi-structured interviews with stakeholders. Findings supported the proposition that a UCC represents an IOI and increases stakeholder performance in both urban and operational contexts. Contributions include combining aspects of IOI and DOI theory to broaden understanding of stakeholder expectations of adoption factors and determining seven factors that play a key role for stakeholders to adopt this form of innovation and in understanding IOI dropouts: relative advantage, compatibility, complexity, adoption risk, trialability, partner trust, and partner power/government influence. © 2019, © 2019 Kedge Business School.","Bristol-Bath; diffusion of innovation theory; inter-organisational innovation; logistics pooling; Urban Consolidation Centre (UCC)",,"Ackermann, F., Eden, C., Strategic Management of Stakeholders: Theory and Practice (2011) Long Range Planning, 44 (3), pp. 179-196; Alho, A.R., de Abreu E Silva, J., Utilizing Urban Form Characteristics in Urban Logistics Analysis: A Case Study in Lisbon, Portugal (2015) Journal of Transport Geography, 42, pp. 57-71; Al-Jabri, I.M., Sadiq Sohail, M., Mobile Banking Adoption: Application of Diffusion of Innovation Theory (2012) Journal of Electronic Commerce Research, 13 (4), pp. 379-391; Allen, J., Browne, M., Woodburn, A., Leonardi, J., The Role of Urban Consolidation Centres in Sustainable Freight Transport (2012) Transport Reviews, 32 (4), pp. 473-490; Allen, J., Browne, M., Woodburn, A., Leonardi, J., A Review of Urban Consolidation Centres in the Supply Chain Based on A Case Study Approach (2014) Supply Chain Forum: International Journal, 15 (4), pp. 100-111; Arlbjørn, J.S., de Haas, H., Munksgaard, K.B., Exploring Supply Chain Innovation (2011) Logistics Research, 3 (1), pp. 3-18; Armbruster, H., Bikfalvi, A., Kinkel, S., Lay, G., Organizational Innovation: The Challenge of Measuring Non-Technical Innovation in Large-Scale Surveys (2008) Technovation, 28 (10), pp. 644-657; Barratt, M., Understanding the Meaning of Collaboration in the Supply Chain (2004) Supply Chain Management: An International Journal, 9 (1), pp. 30-42; Barringer, B.R., Harrison, J.S., Walking a Tightrope: Creating Value through Interorganizational Relationships (2000) Journal of Management, 26 (3), pp. 367-403; Battisti, G., Stoneman, P., How Innovative are UK Firms?

This paper applies the evolutionary game theory to study the governmental intervention mechanism for the layout of urban distribution centers, establishes a static evolutionary game model between the government and distribution enterprises with considering consumers' green preferences, and analyzes the interaction mechanism between the government and distribution enterprises. Moreover, dynamic tax evolutionary game model is established to explore the direction of system evolution under the dynamic scenario. In the simulation, we compare the merits and demerits of the two scenarios, and make a sensitivity of taxation and consumers' green preferences. The research results show that the evolutionary game system can't reach the asymptotic stable state under the static mechanism, but can reach the asymptotic stable state under the dynamic taxation mechanism, and the level of taxation and consumers' green preference has a significant impact on the decision-making of distribution enterprise.

The methodology integrates indications deriving from public policies (objectives and constraints) and efficiency needs of carriers and retailers. For this reason, two planning levels are integrated into the methodology: an outer level in which a set of feasible UDC locations is defined; an inner level in which, for each location, the carrier behaviour in delivering freight to a set of retailers, characterized by variable restocking demand, is simulated (by means of a vehicle routing problem). The aim of the paper is to support the planning of city logistics measures by means of quantitative evaluations; that could be carried out by public authority to verify sustainability of logistic operations. A laboratory test is implemented in the town of Reggio Calabria (Southern Italy) to assess the effects of a combination of two city logistics measures: a nodal physical measure, such as an UDC, and an equipment measure, specifically Fully Electric Vehicles (FEVs). © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","City logistics; Fully electric vehicles; Planning and evaluation methods; Sustainability; Urban distribution centre; Vehicle routing problem","electric vehicle; logistics; routing; sustainability; transportation planning; urban transport; Calabria; Italy; Reggio di Calabria","Awasthi, A., Chauhan, S.S., Goyal, S.K., A multi-criteria decision making approach for location planning for urban distribution centers under uncertainty (2011) Math.

The standardized construction development of urban distribution centers will help to achieve efficient use of urban resources. This paper studies the classification and grading of urban distribution centers. Based on the function, urban distribution centers can be divided into three types: supply-oriented, sales-oriented and comprehensive. For the classification of urban distribution centers, the Delphi Method is used to select the three indicators of floor area, annual throughput and registered capital as the basis for the grading of urban distribution centers. Then, from the perspective of scale economy, the engineering method is used to measure the reasonable scale of urban distribution centers. Finally, the reasonable scale is divided into five grades by using the Equal Difference Method, i.e. urban distribution centers are divided into five grades. © 2019 IEEE.","Classification; Delphi Method; Engineering method; Grading; Urban distribution center","Classification (of information); Freight transportation; Grading; Warehouses; Construction development; Delphi method; Difference method; Engineering methods; Logistics process; Scale economies; Urban distribution; Urban distribution centers; Geographical distribution","Xin, Y., Investigation report of German logistics park China Logistics and Procurement, 2013 (6), pp. 66-68; (2003) Best Practices in Statewide Freight Planning, p. 10. , Cambridge Systematics, Inc.

To decrease the negative impact of these issues, different methods have been traditionally implemented. On the one hand, the location of urban consolidation Centers (UCCs) near a city can be used to consolidate freight delivery services. Therefore, the number of trucks moving in urban areas can be reduced. On the other hand, Horizontal Cooperation can also help to reduce environmental impact while increasing service level. This paper combines both strategies, that is, we deal with the location of UCCs and, simultaneously, we analyze different scenarios where the players of different supply chain processes exhibit various levels of cooperation. Thus, different levels of cooperations regarding routing and UCCs-location decisions are considered in the following scenarios: (a) non-cooperative case, in which all decisions are decentralized (i.e., each enterprise solves its own vehicle routing problem); (b) low-cooperative case, where depot capacities are shared but the customers are still being served by each company's fleet of vehicles; (c) semi-cooperative case, based on centralized route planning decisions (i.e. facilities and fleets are shared among participating enterprises); and (d) fully cooperative scenario, where the routing plans and facility-location decisions are taken by consensus amongst all the participants. In order to estimate the benefits of both strategies, we propose a flexible metaheuristic algorithm to deal with the combined location and routing problem under the different cooperative scenarios. Our results show impressive benefits of the proposed approach. © 2019 by the authors; licensee Growing Science, Canada.","Biased Randomization; Horizontal Cooperation; Location Routing Problem; Metaheuristics; Urban Consolidation Center; Vehicle Routing Problem",,"Akca, Z., Berger, R., Ralphs, T., A branch-and-price algorithm for combined location and routing problems under capacity restrictions (2009) Operations Research and Cyber-Infrastructure, pp. 309-330. , Springer, pp; Allen, J., Browne, M., Woodburn, A., Leonardi, J., The role of urban consolidation centres in sustainable freight transport (2012) Transport Reviews, 32 (4), pp. 473-490; Alvarez Fernandez, S., Ferone, D., Juan, A.A., Silva, D.G., de Armas, J., A 2-stage biased-randomized iterated local search for the uncapacitated single allocation p-hub median problem (2018) Transactions on Emerging Telecommunications Technologies; Browne, M., Allen, J., Leonardi, J., Evaluating the use of an urban consolidation centre and electric vehicles in central London (2011) IATSS Research, 35 (1), pp. 1-6; Browne, M., Allen, J., Nemoto, T., Patier, D., Visser, J., Reducing social and environmental impacts of urban freight transport: A review of some major cities (2012) Procedia-Social and Behavioral Sciences, 39, pp. 19-33; Clarke, G., Wright, J.W., Scheduling of vehicles from a central depot to a number of delivery points (1964) Operations Research, 12 (4), pp. 568-581; Cruijssen, F., Cools, M., Dullaert, W., Horizontal cooperation in logistics: Opportunities and impediments (2007) Transportation Research Part E: Logistics and Transportation Review, 43 (2), pp. 129-142; Cruijssen, F., Dullaert, W., Fleuren, H., Horizontal cooperation in transport and logistics: A literature review (2007) Transportation Journal, 46 (3), pp. 22-39; de Assis Correia, V., de Oliveira, L.K., Guerra, A.L., Economical and environmental analysis of an urban consolidation center for Belo Horizonte city (Brazil) (2012) Procedia-Social and Behavioral Sciences, 39, pp. 770-782; Dominguez, O., Juan, A., Faulin, J., A biased-randomized algorithm for the two-dimensional vehicle routing problem with and without item rotations (2014) International Transactions in Operational Research, 21 (3), pp. 375-398; Gansterer, M., Hartl, R.F., Collaborative vehicle routing: A survey (2018) European Journal of Operational Research, 268 (1), pp. 1-12; Gogas, M.A., Nathanail, E., Evaluation of urban consolidation centers: A methodological framework (2017) Procedia Engineering, 178, pp. 461-471; Gonzalez-Neira, E.M., Ferone, D., Hatami, S., Juan, A.A., A biased-randomized simheuristic for the distributed assembly permutation flowshop problem with stochastic processing times (2017) Simulation Modelling Practice and Theory, 79, pp. 23-36. , Supplement C; Grasas, A., Juan, A.A., Lourenco, H.R., Simils: A simulation-based extension of the iterated local search metaheuristic for stochastic combinatorial optimization (2016) Journal of Simulation, 10 (1), pp. 69-77; Grimm, N.B., Faeth, S.H., Golubiewski, N.E., Redman, C.L., Wu, J., Bai, X., Briggs, J.M., Global change and the ecology of cities (2008) Science, 319 (5864), pp. 756-760; Juan, A.A., Faulin, J., Ferrer, A., Lourenco, H.R., Barrios, B., MIRHA: Multi-start biased randomization of heuristics with adaptive local search for solving non-smooth routing problems (2013) TOP, 21 (1), pp. 109-132; Juan, A.A., Goentzel, J., Bektas, T., Routing fleets with multiple driving ranges: Is it possible to use greener fleet configurations?

A widely studied measure to reduce these negative effects are Urban Consolidation Centers (UCCs), which aim to bundle freight flows to reduce the number of urban freight transports. However, many projects showed that the additional costs of UCCs often made it unattractive for carriers to participate in such schemes. This paper presents an agent-based simulation to assess the impact of urban access regulations on the cost-attractiveness of UCCs for carriers. A case study inspired by the Frankfurt Rhine-Main area is presented to compare deliveries of a group of carriers with and without a Urban Consolidation Center under various urban access scenarios. The simulation shows that regulations increase the cost-attractiveness of UCCs for carriers to varying degrees while increasing the overall traffic volume. © 2018 IEEE",,"Air quality; Additional costs; Agent based simulation; Noise emissions; Quality problems; Rhine-Main area; Road congestion; Urban consolidation; Urban freight transport; Freight transportation","(2004) Analyse Comparative des Systèmes Logistiques Rochelais et Monégasques - Éléments pour Un Guide Méthodologique, , http://www.ademe.fr/espaces-logistiques-urbains-monaco-rochelle-elements-guide-methodologique, Agence de l'Environnement et de la Maîtrise de l'Energie Accessed April 4th, 2018; Allen, J., Anderson, S., Browne, M., Jones, P., (2000) A Framework for Considering Policies to Encourage Sustainable Urban Freight Traffic and Goods/Service Flows: Summary Report, , Technical report, University of Westminster; Allen, J., Browne, M., Cherret, T., McLeod, F., (2008) Review of UK Urban Freight Studies, , Technical report, University of Westminster and University of Southampton; Allen, J., Browne, M., Woodburn, A., Leonardi, J., The role of urban consolidation centres in sustainable freight transport (2012) Transport Reviews, 32 (4), pp. 473-490; Battaia, G., Faure, L., Marqués, G., Guillaume, R., Montoya-Torres, J.R., A methodology to anticipate the activity level of collaborative networks: The case of urban consolidation (2014) Supply Chain Forum: An International Journal, 15 (4), pp. 70-82; Browne, M., Sweet, M., Woodburn, A., Allen, J., (2005) Urban Freight Consolidation Centres: Final Report, , Technical report, University of Westminster; Churchill, K., (2014) A Public Sector Perspective on Consolidation-London Boroughs Consolidation Centre, , http://www.urbantransportgroup.org/system/files/general-docs/Kevin%20Churchill.pdf, Accessed April 1st, 2018; Crainic, T.G., Ricciardi, N., Storchi, G., Models for evaluating and planning city logistics systems (2009) Transportation Science, 43 (4), pp. 432-454; Ducret, R., Parcel deliveries and urban logistics: Changes and challenges in the courier express and parcel sector in Europe - The French case (2014) Research in Transportation Business & Management, 11, pp. 15-22; Estrada, M., Roca-Riu, M., Stakeholder's profitability of carrier-led consolidation strategies in urban goods distribution (2017) Transportation Research Part E: Logistics and Transportation Review, 104, pp. 165-188; Huschebeck, M., Allen, J., (2005) BESTUFS Policy and Research Recommendations I: Urban Consolidation Centres, Last Mile Solutions, , http://www.bestufs.net, Technical report, Best Urban Freight Solutions II, BESTUFS Consortium; Janjevic, M., Ndiaye, A., Investigating the financial viability of urban consolidation centre projects (2017) Research in Transportation Business & Management, 24, pp. 101-113; Janjevic, M., Ndiaye, A., Investigating the theoretical cost-relationships of urban consolidation centres for their users (2017) Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice, 102, pp. 98-118; Luxen, D., Vetter, C., Real-time Routing with OpenStreetMap Data (2011) Proceedings of the 19th ACM SIGSPATIAL International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems, pp. 513-516. , edited by D.

Past attempts reveal however that the cases of success are scarce. This manuscript describes the results of a research aimed at evaluating the perspectives of the urban logistics agents regarding the implementation of a UDC in Lisbon Historic Downtown. The research method was based on a literature review, followed by a set of 24 semistructured interviews to both public and private agents. The results reveal an agreement on the addedvalue of a UDC. The investigation evidenced, however, divergences between agents on the management model, and on the most relevant requirements and conditions to the success of the UDC. The manuscript concludes with recommendations for the mitigation of the divergences. © 2018 Associacao Portuguesa para o Desenvolvimento Regional (APDR).Os Centros de Distribuição Urbana (CDU) são vistos com particular interesse enquanto solução mitigadora dos problemas decorrentes da atividade logística.

Thus, this paper purposes a model to support the formulation of public policies focused on urban logistics, with emphasis on Urban Distribution Centers (UDCs). The method used is mathematical simulation based on System Dynamics and incorporates elements of inventory management and operations management. This paper presents the model and the proposed procedure for its application in two hypothetical cities, and compares the adoption of UDCs with other policies. The results, measured by total logistics costs and greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions indicate that the restrictions tend to negatively impact both indicators. On the other hand, UDCs are robust solutions that can reduce both costs and emissions and outperform other policies in the case of cities that have reached critical congestion levels. The replicability of the model is discussed. © 2019 Editora CHAMPAGNAT.

Duranti, 95, Perugia, 06125, Italy","The last mile logistics involve the last phase of the supply chain i.e. the delivery to clients (vice versa the first phase of reverse logistics). Its impact is very high in terms of traffic, local air pollutions, noise, greenhouse gas emissions, etc. due to the numerous presence of goods vehicles often characterized by a low level of load saturation. Furthermore the final part of the supply chain is the least efficient and the more expensive of the entire logistics chain. Logistics distribution in urban areas needs to be optimized to be sustainable. The Urban Consolidation Centres (UCCs) are considered as solutions to solve urban logistics problems: increase in load factor and in service levels, and the reduction of congestion and emissions are the main advantages that these logistics infrastructure entail. To evaluate sustainability of this part of supply chain specific information are necessary: routes, points of delivery, traffic conditions, number of vehicles, volumes of goods. An analysis based on data from limit traffic zone (LTZ) cameras and on manual data collection allows an initial evaluation on the introduction in the supply chain of UCC. In particular the aim of the paper is to present a preliminary methodology to detect index figures (IF) for the UCCs sizing. Starting from data on vehicles, the goal is to extrapolate IF to compare with other existing realities. The analysis is conducted in a medium Italian city. © 2019, AIDI - Italian Association of Industrial Operations Professors.

The center receives orders according to a stochastic arrival process and dispatches them in batches for the last-mile distribution. The operator of the center aims to find the cost-minimizing consolidation policy, depending on the orders at hand, preannounced orders, and stochastic arrivals. We present this problem as a variant of the delivery dispatching problem that includes dispatch windows and define a corresponding Markov decision model. Larger instances of the problem suffer from intractably large state-, outcome-, and action spaces. We propose an approximate dynamic programming (ADP) algorithm that can handle such instances, using a linear value function approximation to estimate the downstream costs. To design the value function approximation, we construct various sets of basis functions, numerically evaluate their suitability, and discuss the properties of good basis functions for the dispatching problem. Numerical experiments on toy-sized instances show that the best set of basis functions approximates the optimal values with an error of less than 3%. To cope with large action spaces, we formulate an integer linear program to be used within our ADP algorithm. We evaluate the performance of ADP policies against four benchmark policies: two heuristic policies, a direct cost minimization policy, and a post-decision rollout policy. We test the performance of ADP on a variety of networks. ADP consistently outperforms the benchmark policies, performing particularly well when there is sufficient flexibility in dispatch times.

There is, however, limited knowledge as to the actual performance of UCCs, and what roles and perspectives the involved actors have in the performance measurement. The overall aim of this paper is to investigate the roles and perspectives of involved actors when estimating and evaluating the performance of UCCs. The article is based on a study of one case that evaluates the performance of a UCC involving several actors. Interviews were triangulated with documents from the case. The results showed that actors have different roles in performance measurements and even if they share a mutual interest in conducting the measurements, they did not share opinions regarding factors such as system limits or performance indicators. The study provides a deeper understanding of the importance of inter-organizational interaction when conducting performance measurements. The study provides additional insights into the roles of the actors and their perspectives in logistics performance measurement that targets energy usage and environmental impact. These aspects are seldom addressed in less complex estimations or mathematical modelling estimations. © 2019 by the authors.","Assessment; City logistics; Collaboration; Environmental and social sustainability; Freight transport; Indicators; Inter-organizational interaction; Performance measurement; Urban consolidation center","Estimation; Freight transportation; Indicators (instruments); Sustainable development; Urban transportation; Assessment; City logistics; Collaboration; Environmental and social sustainability; Freight transport; Interorganizational interaction; Performance measurements; Urban consolidation; Environmental impact","Piecyk, M., Cullinane, S., Edwards, J., Assessing the external impacts of freight transport (2015) Green Logistics: Improving the Environmental Sustainability of Logistics, , McKinnon, A., Browne, M., Whiteing, A., Piecyk, M., Eds.; Kogan Publishers: London, UK; Allen, J., Browne, M., Holguín-Veras, J., Sustainability strategies for city logistics (2015) Green Logistics: Improving the Environmental Sustainability of Logistics, , McKinnon, A., Browne, M., Whiteing, A., Piecyk, M., Eds.; Kogan Publishers: London, UK; Bányai, T., Real-time decision making in first mile and last mile logistics: How smart scheduling affects energy efficiency of hyperconnected supply chain solutions (2018) Energies, 11, p. 1833; Florescu, M.S., Ceptureanu, E.G., Cruceru, A.F., Ceptureanu, S.I., Sustainable supply chain management strategy influence on supply chain management functions in the oil and gas distribution industry (2019) Energies, 12, p. 1632; Wehner, J., Energy efficiency in logistics: An interactive approach to capacity utilisation (2018) Sustainability, 10, p. 1727; Allen, J., Browne, M., Woodburn, A., Leonardi, J., The role of urban consolidation centres in sustainable freight transport (2012) Transp.

A plausible solution to reduce the impacts of the flow of goods in historical cities is to investigate different deliveries systems to reduce the externalities of this activity. This paper presents the results of a survey that identified the factors involved in the implementation of an Urban Distribution Centre (UDC) in Sabará (Brazil), considering modes non-motorized to perform the delivery in historic centres. For this, we identified the perception of retailers concerning historical and technical attributes. We analysed the data using descriptive statistics. The results indicate that lack of attractiveness of UDC, considering the point of view of retailers located in historic city centre. However, we identify the need to explore solutions for urban delivery in Brazilian historical cities to preserve historic heritage. © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

City logistics models can be effectively helpful for solving the complicated problems of this city. In the present study, a queuing theory-based bi-objective mathematical model is presented, which aims to optimize the environmental and economic costs in city logistics operations. It also tries to reduce the response time in the network. The first objective is associated with all beneficiaries and the second one is applicable for perishable and necessary goods. The proposed model makes decisions on urban distribution centers location problem. Subsequently, as a case study, the fruit and vegetable distribution network of Tehran city is investigated and redesigned via the proposed modelling. The results of the implementation of the model through traditional and augmented ε-constraint methods indicate the efficiency of the proposed model in redesigning the given network. © 2018 by the authors; licensee Growing Science, Canada.","Carbon emission; City logistics; Fruit and vegetable distribution; Network; Network design; Queuing theory; Urban distribution centers",,"Anand, N., Quak, H., Van Duin, R., Tavasszy, L., City logistics modeling efforts: Trends and gaps-A review (2012) Procedia-Social and Behavioral Sciences, 39, pp. 101-115; Anand, N., Van Duin, R., Quak, H., Tavasszy, L., Relevance of city logistics modelling efforts: A review (2015) Transport Reviews, 35 (6), pp. 701-719; Bérubé, J.F., Gendreau, M., Potvin, J.Y., An exact ϵ-constraint method for bi-objective combinatorial optimization problems: Application to the Traveling Salesman Problem with Profits (2009) European Journal of Operational Research, 194 (1), pp. 39-50; Changkong, V., Haimes, Y.Y., Multiobjective decision making: Theory and methodology (1983) North-Holland Series in System Science and Engineering, 8. , Elsevier Science Publishing Co New York NY; Crainic, T.G., Ricciardi, N., Storchi, G., Models for evaluating and planning city logistics systems (2009) Transportation Science, 43 (4), pp. 432-454; Dablanc, L., Goods transport in large European cities: Difficult to organize, difficult to modernize (2007) Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice, 41 (3), pp. 280-285; Duren, R.M., Miller, C.E., Measuring the carbon emissions of megacities (2012) Nature Climate Change, 2 (8), 560p; Ehrgott, M., (2005) Multicriteria Optimization, 491. , Springer Science & Business Media; Haimes, Y.Y., On a bicriterion formulation of the problems of integrated system identification and system optimization (1971) IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, 1 (3), pp. 296-297; He, X., Hu, W., Wu, J.H., Wang, C., Improving emergency goods transportation performance in metropolitan areas under multi-echelon queuing conditions (2013) Procedia-Social and Behavioral Sciences, 96, pp. 2466-2479; Barceló, J., Grzybowska, H., Pardo, S., Combining vehicle routing models and microscopic traffic simulation to model and evaluating city logistics applications (2005) The Proceedings of the 16Th Mini-Euro Conference and 10Th Meeting of EWGT, , Italy; Mavrotas, G., Effective implementation of the ε-constraint method in multi-objective mathematical programming problems (2009) Applied Mathematics and Computation, 213 (2), pp. 455-465; Miettinen, K., Nonlinear Multiobjective Optimization (1999) Volume 12 of International Series in Operations Research and Management Science; Moutaoukil, A., Neubert, G., Derrouiche, R., Urban Freight Distribution: The impact of delivery time on sustainability (2015) Ifac-Papersonline, 48 (3), pp. 2368-2373; Muñuzuri, J., Cortés, P., (2012) Recent Advances and Future Trends in City Logistics; Saeedi, F., Teimoury, E., Makui, A., Designing sustainable city logistics distribution network using a probabilistic bi-objective mathematical model (2018) Uncertain Supply Chain Management, 6 (4), pp. 357-374; Taniguchi, E., (2001) City Logistics: Network Modelling and Intelligent Transport Systems, , Amsterdam: Pergamon; Taniguchi, E., Thompson, R.G., (2014) City Logistics: Mapping the Future, , CRC Press; Taniguchi, E., Thompson, R.G., Yamada, T., Recent trends and innovations in modelling city logistics (2014) Procedia-Social and Behavioral Sciences, 125, pp. 4-14; Teimoury, E., Saeedi, F., Makui, A., A Mathematical Model for City Logistics Distribution Network Design with the Aim of Minimizing Response Time (2017) International Journal of Industrial Engineering & Production Research, 28 (1), pp. 21-31; Qiu, F.Y., Yang, D., City Logistics in China: An Overview (2005) Recent Advances in City Logistics, pp. 417-427. , E.

Due to the increasing number of residents in cities and increasing demand for e-commerce, increased the number of supply vehicles in cities, as well as pollution, congestions and car accidents. The most common solution for effective last mile delivery like vehicles using alternative fuels or electric vehicles for supplying the cities isn’t enough anymore. There is a need to focus on the total number of vehicles in cities and on sufficient use of loading space of those vehicles. An urban consolidation centre (UCC) could be a possible solution to economic, social and environmental problems in cities. This article focuses on possible using a UCC in the Czech Republic cities up to 100,000 residents. The article also provides an evaluation of the essential criteria for sustainability of UCC for the future. © 2019 Kaunas University of Technology.

For the last two decades, the concept of urban consolidation centres (UCCs) has been implemented in different cities. UCCs that were started for special subsectors (e.g. construction material handling) are relatively successful; however, general purpose UCCs are not performing well at all. Most UCCs are financially dependent on government support. The UCC concept can be successfully implemented by developing a consistent subsidy or tax scheme aiming to internalize the negative external effects of conventional urban goods distribution. In this paper, we describe and test such policy - a delivery cap and price (DCAP) scenario, combined with a subsidy for a UCC alternative – to reduce carbon emissions for urban goods delivery. The scenario introduces a cap on goods deliveries made to shopkeepers by conventional vehicles, using so-called carbon credit points (CCPs). We demonstrate this policy with a stylized implementation of a city logistics agent based model for the inner city of Rotterdam. The results indicate that this financial scheme could positively influences the use of UCC, ensures its financial viability and significantly reduce the external effects of urban freight transport. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Agent-based modelling; Cap and trade; Carbon credit points; City logistics; Urban consolidation centre; Urban freight transport",,"Alho, A., Bhavathrathan, B., Stinson, M., Gopalakrishnan, R., Le, D.-T., Ben-Akiva, M., A multi-scale agent-based modelling framework for urban freight distribution (2017) Transportation Research Procedia, 27, pp. 188-196; Allen, J., Browne, M., Woodburn, A., Leonardi, J., The role of urban consolidation centres in sustainable freight transport (2012) Transport Reviews, 32 (4), pp. 473-490; Anand, N., van Duin, R., Tavasszy, L., Ontology-based multi-agent system for urban freight transportation (2014) International Journal on the Unity of the Sciences, 18 (2), pp. 133-153; Anand, N., Yang, M., van Duin, J.H.R., Tavasszy, L., GenCLOn: An ontology for city logistics (2012) Expert Systems with Applications, 39 (15), pp. 11944-11960; Axelrod, R., Agent-based modeling as a bridge between disciplines (2006) Handbook of Computational Economics, 2, pp. 1565-1584; Balm, S., Browne, M., Leonardi, J., Quak, H., Developing an evaluation framework for innovative urban and interurban freight transport solutions (2014) Procedia-Social and Behavioral Sciences, 125, pp. 386-397; Behrends, S., Lindholm, M., Woxenius, J., The impact of urban freight transport: A definition of sustainability from an actor's perspective (2008) Transportation Planning and Technology, 31 (6), pp. 693-713; Bonabeau, E., Agent-based modeling: Methods and techniques for simulating human systems (2002) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 99, p. 7280; Browne, M., Sweet, M., Woodburn, A., Allen, J., Urban freight consolidation centres final report (2005); Browne, M., Woodburn, A., Allen, J., Urban freight consolidation centers - final report (2005); van Duin, J., Quak, H., Munuzuri, J., Revival of cost benefit analysis for evaluating the city distribution centre concept?

In this study, location selection problem for fresh fruits and vegetables market hall (F&VMH) which is an important urban distribution center type that fulfills the food requirements of city residents is examined. The interval-valued trapezoidal fuzzy grey relational analysis (GRA) method is used to solve this problem because, it is suitable to deal with poor, incomplete, and uncertain information. When the results are analyzed, it is seen that F&VMHs have to be located in the district which is closer to producers and which has the lower construction and land costs. © INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING.","Decision making;

However, implementing them poses a challenge because they incur high costs, coordinating different agents and multiple criteria. In historical cities, a UDC is an alternative to efficient urban freight transport (UFT) in terms of sustainability and preservation of historical heritage. This study analyses the operational, economic, social, cultural, and environmental criteria that influence the implementation of a UDC in historical cities, considering the different perspectives of four agents: residents, traffic wardens, retailers and carriers. We conducted semi-structured interviews with traffic wardens and retailers, and a survey was developed with all the agents. Univariate and multivariate statistical analyses were applied to find the relevant criteria for implementing a UDC according to the agents. Considering the viewpoint of all agents, the vehicle size was the most relevant common criteria when setting up a UDC to supply retailers in the historical city centre of Ouro Preto. Residents and traffic wardens had very similar points of view and agreed with the negative effects of UFT (air pollution level, visual intrusion level, insecurity, and congestion), while most retailers and carriers disagreed with these impacts. © 2019 Institute for Transport Studies Within the European Economic Integration (ISTIEE) and Italian Association for Traffic and Transport Engineering (AIIT).

Freight consolidation policies offer a sustainable solution to address these problems. The freight vehicles used in the consolidated deliveries could play a significant role in the sustainability and success of these policies. This paper applies a multi-stakeholder decision support approach to evaluate the suitability and potential of various delivery fleet configurations in addressing the perspectives and requirements of all stakeholders involved in last mile delivery to perform the consolidated delivery in the inner-city area. The Multi-Actor Multi-Criteria Analysis (MAMCA) framework was utilised to assess and rank various delivery configurations involving a combination of eco-friendly delivery vans, trucks and cargobikes based on the objectives of the stakeholders. The weight allocation of the criteria was determined through the Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (F-AHP) method using responses collected from key actors representing all stakeholder groups in Melbourne, Australia. The multi-stakeholder analysis, which was performed using the Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment Evaluation (PROMETHEE) method, suggested that the consolidated delivery should be performed using a combination of eco-friendly delivery vans and cargobikes to incorporate the concerns of the societal stakeholders and operational requirements of the business stakeholders. The mono-actor analysis revealed the heterogeneity of the stakeholders' preferences and clashing views regarding the optimal delivery fleet. This highlights the importance of incorporating a multi-stakeholder perspective in the planning and selection of suitable urban freight policies. Accordingly, a suitable implementation plan for the consolidated delivery fleet was proposed to reflect the perspectives and requirements of these stakeholders. © 2018 by the authors.","Freight consolidation policy; Last mile delivery; Multi-actor multi-criteria analysis (MAMCA); Multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA); Urban consolidation centre",,"Antún, J.P., Reis, V., Macário, R., Strategies to Improve Urban Freight Logistics in Historical Centers: The Cases of Lisbon and Mexico City (2018) City Logistics 3: Towards Sustainable and Liveable Cities, pp. 349-366. , Taniguchi, E., Thompson, R., Eds.;Wiley-ISTE: London, UK; Quak, H., (2007) Sustainability of Urban Freight Transport-Retail Distribution and Local Regulations in Cities, , Ph.

However, their implementations are sometimes failing. Involving stakeholders in the decision process is increasingly recognised to be a necessity to guarantee the adoption of these solutions by the sector and ensure their successful implementation. The objective of the paper is therefore to contribute to the development of a bottom-up approach where stakeholders are involved in the evaluation and selection of more sustainable strategies for city logistics. The authors present the MAMCA as a method which structures the consultation process of stakeholders. This approach was tested in a workshop in Brussels and the paper uses that consultation process as an illustration of the methodology. That application demonstrated the benefits of the MAMCA to ensure a productive workshop. The methodology allows the authorities to especially identify the priorities of the stakeholders in city logistics, to guide the discussion towards a consensus and to provide inputs for an eventual adaptation of the strategies. © 2018 World Conference on Transport Research Society","Battery electric vehicles; City logistics; Multi-actor multi-criteria analysis; Stakeholder analysis; Urban consolidation centres",,"Allen, B., Browne, M., Piotrowska, M., Woodburn, A.G., Freight Quality Partnerships in the UK – An Analysis of their Work and Achievements (2010), Green Logistics; Allen, J., Browne, M., Woodburn, A., Leonardi, J., The role of urban consolidation centres in sustainable freight transport (2012) Transp.

Despite this, UCC often fails in practice, which indicates a knowledge gap. Furthermore, research within the field can be described as fragmented, transdisciplinary and fast growing. The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of the field by describing dominant categories and themes within the area, identify gaps in order to propose a future research agenda, and provide insights into the needs of practitioners. Design/methodology/approach: A systematic literature review (SLR) targeting journal articles based on UCCs has been constructed with a supplementary snowball approach. A content analysis was performed to categorise themes in the research on UCCs and to identify research gaps, both within and outside the categories identified. Findings: Despite substantial research on UCC, very little research ends up in academic journals. In all, 56 articles address UCC. The most common topics were the role of stakeholders, design of distribution structures and transport resources, environmental and social consideration, and economic considerations. Much focus is directed towards finding “optimal” solutions and designs for potential initiatives with very little, if any, consideration to financial viability or the management of the UCC initiative. Research limitations/implications: This research points out existing gaps in the literature and proposes a future research agenda with UCCs as the focus. For example, although environmental and social arguments are often applied to justify the implementation of UCCs, few studies measure or evaluate their impact. Another important research gap is the economical consideration, both how to generate revenue and how to consider economies of scale. Practical implications: The practical contribution of most studies is directed towards municipalities. Few findings are presented in a way to support companies. Additionally, by bridging the gaps related to how stakeholders can collaborate and describe what is happening in a UCC, practitioners can use such information as guidelines. Originality/value: The results provide a research agenda for the fragmented research targeting UCCs, supporting the viability of future initiatives. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","City logistics;

We present a cost allocation model that is based on solution concepts from cooperative game theory, for allocating the operational costs associated with the collaboration. It is assumed that the municipality is willing to carry some cost to ensure a stable collaboration for the potential benefits received, e.g., reduced traffic congestion in the city. The model is applied to some illustrative examples, and the cost allocation results are discussed. It is shown that the role of the municipality may be decisive in achieving a stable collaboration between the freight forwarders, and further that the municipality does not necessarily need to contribute to covering the costs. © 2018 World Scientific Publishing Co.","city distribution center; Collaboration; cost allocation; municipality","Cost accounting; Costs; Game theory; Traffic congestion; Urban planning; Urban transportation; City distribution; Collaboration; Cooperative game theory; Cost allocation; Freight forwarders; municipality; Potential benefits; Solution concepts; Freight transportation","Agarwal, R., Ergun, O., Network design and allocation mechanisms for carrier alliances in liner shipping (2010) Operations Research, 58, pp. 1726-1742; Allen, J., Thorne, G., Browne, M., (2007) Bestufs Good Practice Guide on Urban Freight Transport, , Technical report, BESTUFS; Anderson, S., Allen, J., Browne, M., Urban logistics-how can it meet policy makers' sustainability objectives?

For this reason, in recent years several city authorities have promoted different measures to foster the implementation of urban consolidation centers. However, only a few real-world publicly promoted initiatives have succeeded due to several operational, financial, and regulatory issues. In this paper, we investigate different city logistics solutions for a mail delivery service in the city of Austin, Texas. We do that by using a model for the multi-depot vehicle routing problem with heterogeneous vehicle fleet for urban consolidation centers (UCCs) based on metaheuristics. The model considers the total costs and the environmental impacts of alternative UCC configurations and policy scenarios. According to the results, combinations of regulations and subsidies addressing both traffic inbound and outbound the facilities could be the most efficient and environmental friendly approaches. Factors like demand and traffic congestion have a significant impact on the overall performance of the solutions. © 2017 World Conference on Transport Research Society","City logistics; Heterogeneous fleet; Location-routing; Urban consolidation centers; Urban freight transport",,"Österle, I., Aditjandra, P.T., Vaghi, C., Grea, G., Zunder, T.H., The role of a structured stakeholder consultation process within the establishment of a sustainable urban supply chain (2015) Supply Chain Manage.: Int.

Yet increasing level of logistics sprawl in megacity associated with various urban diseases has been creating new challenges for selecting the location of DCs. In this paper, a mathematical model is proposed to enable an efficient and green distribution system by minimizing the total cost, which contains economics cost, environmental cost, and socio-economic cost. The model is a mixed-integer linear programming model and is characterized with quantifying and pricing the multifarious negative externalities. To verify the effectiveness of the model, a case study is conducted. IBM ILOG CPLEX is adopted for optimization purpose. Then, a sensitive analysis is provided to investigate the impact of various parameters coefficients on the results.

These UDCs have to meet daily demands for delivery on time of their allocated urban areas. However, these demands may not be met when they exceed the available capacities of these infrastructures. In addition, some UDCs are unavailable when their capacity to deliver is affected by random unavailability or preventive maintenance actions. In this case, the entire site or a part of it will be ""Out Of Service"". Our goal is to improve the efficiency of these UDCs in terms of availability and satisfaction of demands and this via preventive maintenance actions as well as the inter-UDC collaboration strategy. For instance, unavailable UDCs can be delegated to others UDCs as a subcontractor to ensure deliveries for their allocated urban area on time. The choice of subcontractor will depend on distance, environment and availability criteria. In doing so, we define a mathematical model for searching the best distribution correlated to a maintenance plans using a subcontracting strategy for all UDCs. Moreover, we consider delay for the next periods with an expensive penalty. Finally, we present a numerical example illustrating the advantages of our approach. © IEOM Society International.","Integrated maintenance; Subcontracting strategy; Urban distribution center (UDC); urban logistics",,,"Proc.

Previous studies have shown that urban freight consolidation increases the load factor of Delivery Vehicles (DVs), reducing the vehicle-kilometres driven and thus reducing negative freight transport externalities in urban areas. The objective of this paper is to explore the possible impact of the number of Urban Consolidation Centres (UCCs) on the external costs of last-mile deliveries in freight transport and to determine the possible contribution of such consolidation scenarios to external cost mitigation. Therefore, several consolidation scenarios are considered assuming different numbers of UCCs in operation. A new consolidation scheme is proposed with more than one UCC to serve a given city area. Input data are obtained from a roadside questionnaire survey with a sample of 1617 drivers at 9 access roads to an urban area as part of the NOvi Sad TRAnsport Model (NOSTRAM) study. Externalities are calculated using the IMPACT methodology and discussed for different urban freight consolidation options. The best option is identified, and the results indicate that properly planned, organised and managed urban freight consolidation can significantly reduce transport externalities. The main research results showed that all of the proposed consolidation options increase the total driving distance in an urban area. However, some consolidation options significantly reduce the driving distance of less manageable vehicles in last-mile deliveries (long-haul heavy-and light-duty vehicles). Consequently, the external costs ranged from 2108.3 to 5420.5 EUR for the consolidation option, whereas the current state externalities are 2791.4 EUR. Thus, more small UCCs may provide better results than the central centre even in medium-sized cities. © 2017 The Author(s).

The study has been inspired by the need to evaluate the Urban Distribution Center initiative, i.e., Jogja Inland Port by local government that has been hampered due to lack of participating companies. Design/methodology/approach: The proposed framework consists of two steps of analysis. First, spatial analysis to generate alternative locations using weighted Geographical Information System data; second, fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making to select the best location. Fuzzy Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution was applied to deal with multi-criteria, multiple stakeholders, and uncertainty. Accessibility, security, connectivity of multi-modal transport, costs, environmental impact, proximity to customers, proximity to suppliers, resource availability, expansion possibility, service quality, are taken as the decision criteria. Local government of Yogyakarta province, practitioners, and logistic expert, are involved as representative participants in evaluating the Urban Distribution Center location of Yogyakarta Special Region Province. Findings: The proposed framework has indicated that the Jogja Inland Port is not the best alternative. A joint warehouse managed by a group of private companies located in Berbah (Sleman district) appears to be the best alternative location for Urban Distribution Center. Consistent results are also found by using other approaches (Intuitionistic Fuzzy Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution and Set Pair Analysis). Research limitations/implications: In addition to the government, expert, and practitioners that involved in this study, future research could engage local residents as decision makers to refine the results, as various stakeholders may come up with different preferences. Practical implications: From a practical point of view, the application of combined approach (integrating spatial analysis using weighted Geographical Information System data and fuzzy multi-criteria decision making) is a promising approach in dealing with Urban Distribution Center location problem which is characterized by multi-criteria, multiple stakeholders, spatial-related issues, and uncertainty. Social implications: The unsuccessful establishment of Jogja Inland Port implies that Urban Distribution Center location problem is a complex system, involving multifaceted factors that should be considered simultaneously. Originality/value: The research proposes a framework to evaluate and select the appropriate location for Urban Distribution Center through combined approach of weighted Geographical Information System data and fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making which involves relevant stakeholders. © 2018, Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya.

In the past decades, many public and private initiatives have struggled to gain broad stakeholder support and thus remain viable. Researchers and practitioners have only recently recognised stakeholder acceptance of urban freight solutions as a challenge. A first step in achieving convergence is to understand stakeholder needs, preferences and viewpoints. This paper proposes and applies an approach to identify the main stakeholder perspectives in the domain of urban freight transport. We use Q-methodology, which originates from social sciences and psychology, to record subjective positions and identify the dominant ones. We explain the approach, operationalise the method for the domain of urban freight transport and apply it to stakeholder groups in the Netherlands. We find four dominant perspectives, reflecting how stakeholders normally take positions in the urban freight dialogue. Important findings concern disparities between industry associations and some of their membership, divergent views about the expected role of public administration, and the observation that the behaviour of shippers and Logistics Service Providers (LSP) appears to be inconsistent with their beliefs. All these factors together can act as a barrier to the implementation of urban freight consolidation concepts. The Q-methodology is valuable for eliciting perspectives in urban freight and is a promising tool to facilitate stakeholder dialogue and, eventually, convergence. © 2017 The Author(s).

Whilst the majority of urban traffic is created by personal travel, freight vehicles make a relatively large contribution per vehicle to congestion, pollution and severe accidents. The European Commission (EC 2011) estimates that 6% of all EU transport carbon emissions are from urban freight. For these reasons, a well-structured portfolio of measures and policies oriented towards more sustainable and efficient management of supply chain activities carried out in urban areas is needed, in order to reduce negative externalities related to urban mobility and improve economic performance. In recent years, there has been enthusiasm amongst commentators that shared-resource economic models can both create new commercial opportunities and address policy problems, including in the transport sector. Within the city logistics subsector, this new model is exemplified by the emergence of Urban freight Consolidation Centres (UCCs). UCCs replace multiple ‘last-mile’ delivery movements, many of which involving small consignments, by a common receiving point (the consolidation centre), normally on the periphery of a city, with the final part of the delivery being shared by the consignments in a small freight vehicle. Such arrangements can represent a good compromise between the needs of city centre businesses and their customers on the one hand (i.e. high availability of a range of goods) and local and global sustainability objectives on the other. At the same time, by sharing logistics facilities and delivery vehicles, UCCs offer added-value services to both urban economic actors, such as retailers, and network logistics providers. However, UCCs add to the complexity of logistics chains, requiring additional contracts, communications and movement stages. These arrangements also introduce additional actors within the supply of delivery services, notably local authorities present as promoters and funders, rather than simply as regulators, companies specialised in the UCC operation, and companies, which provide specialist technologies, such as electric delivery vehicles. UCCs therefore also represent an example of multi-stakeholder collaboration. Drawing on the results of a 2013 survey in Bristol (United Kingdom) and a further survey carried out in 2015 in Cagliari (Italy), the present paper will provide an in-depth comparison of the differences in the perceptions of urban freight users and stakeholders towards UCCs. Retailers involved in the survey carried out in Bristol showed high satisfaction with the delivery service provided by the UCC. Different topic areas (e.g. timeliness, reliability, safety) are examined through analyses of both qualitative and quantitative data. The survey carried out in Cagliari investigated the inclination of potential users to join a UCC scheme. The comparison between the two cities considers factors such as the nature of business holding (e.g. SME versus multiple retailers), operational practices (e.g. pattern of deliveries) and operating subsector (e.g. food versus no food). An analysis on the barriers to the implementation of UCCs in Bristol and in Cagliari is provided at the end of the paper. © 2018 The Author(s).

City logistics models can be effective in solving complicated problems such as traffic congestion, air pollution, accidents, and high energy consumption rate. The present paper proposes a bi-objective mathematical model for designing a city logistics distribution network in order to minimize the economic and environmental costs as well as the response time. The proposed model would make decisions on the location and allocation problems in the city logistics distribution network. In fact, the objective of the problem is to select some fixed sites in order to construct the city distribution centers. The demand for commodities is considered probabilistic and the network is modeled based on the queuing theory. Furthermore, in the proposed model, the policy of putting tax on carbon and applying the low-carbon emission resources are used for establishment at the city distribution centers. Afterwards, in order to validate the proposed model, a numerical example is generated and, then, the results obtained from solving the model via epsilon constraint method are presented. Analysis of the results in the present study indicates that the proposed model was highly efficient in achieving its objectives. Finally, there are some suggestions for future studies that can be taken into account. © 2018 by the authors; licensee Growing Science, Canada.","Carbon emissions; City distribution centers; City logistics; Network design; Queuing theory; Sustainability",,"Anand, N., Quak, H., van Duin, R., Tavasszy, L., City logistics modeling efforts: Trends and gaps-A review (2012) Procedia-Social and Behavioral Sciences, 39, pp. 101-115; Anand, N., Van Duin, R., Quak, H., Tavasszy, L., Relevance of city logistics modelling efforts: A review (2015) Transport Reviews, 35 (6), pp. 701-719; Arvan, M., Tavakkoli-Moghaddam, R., Abdollahi, M., Designing a bi-objective and multiproduct supply chain network for the supply of blood (2015) Uncertain Supply Chain Management, 3 (1), pp. 57-68; Babaei, A., Shahanaghi, K., A new model for planning the distributed facilities locations under emergency conditions and uncertainty space in relief logistics (2017) Uncertain Supply Chain Management, 5 (2), pp. 105-125; Barceló, J., Grzybowska, H., Pardo, S., Combining vehicle routing models and microscopic traffic simulation to model and evaluating city logistics applications (2005) The proceedings of the 16th mini-EURO conference and 10th meeting of EWGT, , Italy; Bérubé, J.F., Gendreau, M., Potvin, J.Y., An exact ε-constraint method for bi-objective combinatorial optimization problems: Application to the Traveling Salesman Problem with Profits (2009) European Journal of Operational Research, 194 (1), pp. 39-50; Chankong, V., Haimes, Y.Y., (2008) Multiobjective decision making: Theory and methodology, , Courier Dover Publications; Crainic, T.G., Ricciardi, N., Storchi, G., Models for evaluating and planning city logistics systems (2009) Transportation science, 43 (4), pp. 432-454; Dablanc, L., Goods transport in large European cities: Difficult to organize, difficult to modernize (2007) Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice, 41 (3), pp. 280-285; Duren, R.M., Miller, C.E., Measuring the carbon emissions of megacities (2012) Nature Climate Change, 2 (8), p. 560; Ehrgott, M., (2005) Multicriteria optimization, 491. , Springer Science & Business Media; Haimes, Y.Y., On a bicriterion formulation of the problems of integrated system identification and system optimization (1971) IEEE transactions on systems, man, and cybernetics, 1 (3), pp. 296-297; He, X., Hu, W., Wu, J.H., Wang, C., Improving emergency goods transportation performance in metropolitan areas under multi-echelon queuing conditions (2013) Procedia-Social and Behavioral Sciences, 96, pp. 2466-2479; Jawla, P., Singh, S., A reverse logistic inventory model for imperfect production process with preservation technology investment under learning and inflationary environment (2016) Uncertain Supply Chain Management, 4 (2), pp. 107-122; Moutaoukil, A., Neubert, G., Derrouiche, R., Urban Freight Distribution: The impact of delivery time on sustainability (2015) IFAC-PapersOnLine, 48 (3), pp. 2368-2373; Muñuzuri, J., Cortés, P., Recent advances and future trends in city logistics (2012) Journal of Computational Science, 3 (4), pp. 191-192; Teimoury, E., Saeedi, F., Makui, A., A mathematical model for city logistics distribution network design with the aim of minimizing response Time (2017) International Journal of Industrial Engineering & Production Research, 28 (1), pp. 21-31; Taniguchi, E., (2001) City logistics: Network modelling and intelligent transport systems, , Amsterdam: Pergamon; Taniguchi, E., Thompson, R.G., (2015) City logistics: Mapping the future, , Boston.

Multi-level distribution is an already-known strategy employed by businesses, and the classic formulation of the Two-Echelon Vehicle Routing Problem (2E-VRP) reflects the perspective of a single provider, without regarding the routing decisions of other parties. The lack of coordination between providers executing their individual schedules and, consequently, the lack of a holistic approach to urban traffic may cause further problems. Additionally, the various stakeholders (government, businesses, residents) may have conflicting objectives. The main contribution of this paper is a first-time multi-objective formulation of the multi-provider (or multi-commodity) heterogeneous vehicle 2E-VRP, from a city government perspective within an Urban Goods Movement context, demonstrating with didactic examples the potential benefit of this approach to all parties involved, simultaneously considering potentially conflicting objectives. © 2017 IEEE.","City Distribution Centers;

Its optimization is a main aim of the Sustainable Urban Logistic Plans. Currently, the CO2 analysis of such plans is mostly based on a Tank-To-Wheel approach, which does not consider fuel production and distribution, thus not providing a comprehensive evaluation of its carbon effects. In this paper, we propose an alternative two-step approach: after quantifying CO2 emissions through a Well-To-Wheel methodology, which assesses the entire energy pathway of the fuel, we valuate them economically, using a meta-analysis of 700 studies. We test this model to assess the carbon potentialities of a new Urban Consolidation Centre (UCC) in the city of Lucca, Italy. Our results indicate a potential yearly saving of up to 190 tCO2 (which corresponds to about €10,000 of social cost savings). These benefits are mostly obtained through third funds, which make the investment financially sustainable for the municipality. With adequate adaptations, the model can be used in other urban areas to assess the carbon potentiality of different transport measures. Furthermore, an integration of the long-distance freight movement can provide the total CO2 contribution of freight transport. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","CO2 emissions; Lucca; Urban consolidation centre; Urban freight transport; Well-to-wheel analysis",,"Urban Freight research roadmap (2015), http://www.ertrac.org/uploads/documentsearch/id36/ERTRAC_Alice_Urban_Freight.pdf, Online at [28.10.2015]; Allen, J., Thorne, G., Browne, M., Good practice guide on urban freight, Rijswijk: Bestufs (2007); Ambrosino, G., Guidelines.

However, many UCCs strongly rely on government subsidies and are granted a short life because of their inability to reach financial sustainability. Despite the interest from both the practitioners and the research community in this city logistics scheme, there are a limited number of quantitative contributions that investigate the financial viability of UCC schemes. This paper provides a comprehensive theoretical framework for testing the financial viability of UCC cross-docking and consolidation operations and applies it to a specific case of a UCC servicing Brussels. Major cost categories are identified and human resources are pinpointed as a major cost category. The paper demonstrates that profitable operations are in theory possible but that profits are highly fragile and subject to efficient use of resources. The paper identifies a series of operational metrics that drive the profitability of UCC operations and highlight that the efficient organization of distribution operations has a major influence on its financial viability. Finally, the paper discusses the influence of the size of vehicles and service area on the UCC profitability. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","City logistics; Urban consolidation centres; Urban freight transport",,"ADEME, Analyse comparative des systèmes logistiques rochelais et monégasques - Éléments pour un guide méthodologique.

All the same, researchers have rarely described business model components relevant to city logistics. In response, the purpose of this article is to analyse critical factors for viable business models of city logistics initiatives involving UCCs. Following an extensive literature review and multiple-case study of five initiatives with UCCs, we identified seven critical factors of viable city logistics business models: the ability to scale up and down the UCC solution; an ability to continuously develop and adapt to a dynamic environment; the important entrepreneurial role of the initiator as well; the acknowledgment of society; ability to innovate new services; logistics and supply chain management competence; and the ability to take full advantage of advanced IT. All seven factors describe continuously redeveloped business models seeking to seize new and unexpected opportunities, yet also indicate that city logistics systems require local authorities and municipalities to act as initiators, enablers, and customers. The models also underscore differences between purely commercial and purely municipal city logistics initiatives. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Business models; Critical factors; Urban consolidation centres; Urban logistics",,"Abrahamsson, M., Aldin, N., Stahre, F., Logistics platforms for improved strategic flexibility (2003) International Journal of Logistics: Research and Applications, 6 (3), pp. 85-106; Afuah, A., Business models – a strategic management approach (2004), McGraw-Hill Irwin New York; Alessandrini, A., Site, P.D., Filippi, F., Salucci, M.V., Using rail to make urban freight distributionmore sustainable (2012) European Transport - Trasporti Europei, 50, pp. 1-17; Allen, J., Browne, M., Holguín-Veras, J., Assessing the environmental impacts of freight transport (2015) Green logistics – improving the environmental sustainability of logistics, , A.

By collecting the goods destined to the target area and consolidating deliveries into one large delivery made by high-load vehicles, urban consolidation centres can relieve congestion and improve air quality. Significant benefits also accrue to the participating retailers, e.g. improved staff productivity and safety, the provision of pre-retailing services and recycling of packaging. The paper draws on the experiences of the Bristol-Bath freight consolidation centre (BBFCC), established in 2002 to serve Bristol city centre and uniquely extended in 2011 to cover Bath, each served by electric lorries; it appraises the benefits of shared ‘last mile’ freight services focusing in particular on the perspective of its users: the participating retailers. © 2017 World Conference on Transport Research Society","Case study; City logistics; Stakeholders perception",,"Allen, J., Browne, M., Woodburn, A., Leonardi, J., The role of urban consolidation centres in sustainable freight transport (2012) Transp.

Although there are numerous pilot projects and test cases, many UCCs are granted only a short life because they fail to attract a sufficient number of customers. Evidence from literature shows that the cost-attractiveness of UCC solutions for their users plays a major importance in their decision to use these facilities. Indeed, since UCCs involve additional service costs for their customers, in order to be financially attractive, they must demonstrate their ability to decrease delivery costs further in the transport chain, through distance or time gains. Despite the significant interest of the practitioners and the research community in these facilities, there is a lack of knowledge and quantitative tools for assessing the costs of delivery operations and the potential savings by use of UCCs. In this paper, authors propose an analytical approach to estimating costs of deliveries with and without the UCC based on the description of the logistics behaviour of the urban stakeholders from the literature. The analytical framework is then applied to a case of a UCC servicing Brussels. The study shows that the main costs of deliveries are time-related costs and that the use of the UCC can indeed decrease them. The main elements that influence the cost attractiveness of the UCCs are the characteristics of a delivery operations (e.g. number of stops, average number of cargo units per stop or the type of actor who performs the delivery), the characteristics of the UCC (e.g. its location, the service price or the possibility of overnight deliveries) and the characteristics of the services area (e.g. size of the town or delivery density). © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",,"Public policy; Transportation; Analytical approach; Average numbers; City logistics; nocv1; Pilot projects; Quantitative tool; Research communities; Service prices; Urban consolidation; Costs; analytical framework; cost analysis; logistics; stakeholder; theoretical study; urban transport; Belgium; Brussels [Belgium]; Brussels [Brussels (RGA)]","Allen, J., Anderson, S., Browne, M., Jones, P., A framework for considering policies to encourage sustainable urban freight traffic and goods/service flows: summary report Available from: <> (accessed 29 January 2016) (2000), http://home.wmin.ac.uk/transport/download/urbandistsumm.pdf; Allen, J., Browne, M., Woodburn, A., Leonardi, J., The role of urban consolidation centres in sustainable freight transport (2012) Transp.

This is motivated by the need of UDCs to satisfy daily demand in time under a high service level in allocated urban areas. Moreover, these demands could not be satisfied in individual cases because the delivery rate can be less than daily demand and/or affected by random failure or maintenance actions of vehicles. The scope of our work is to focus on a UDC, which needs to satisfy demands in a finite horizon. To that end, we consider a distribution policy on two sequential plans, a distribution plan correlated to a maintenance plan using a subcontracting strategy with several potential urban distribution centers (UDCs) and performing preventive maintenance to ensure deliveries for their allocated urban area. The choice of subcontractor will depend on distance, environmental and availability criteria. In doing so, we define a mathematical model for searching the best distribution and maintenance plans using a subcontracting strategy. Moreover, we consider delay for the next periods with an expensive penalty. Finally, we present a numerical example illustrating the benefits of our approach. © 2017 by the authors.","Integrated maintenance; Subcontracting strategy; Urban distribution center (UDC); Urban logistics",,"Taniguchi, E., Concept and Best Practices of City Logistics.

In response to these problems, the concept of city logistics emerged, for the purpose of planning, organizing, coordinating and controlling physical and information flows in order to find a compromise between efficient freight distribution in urban areas and protection of the environment. A typical city logistics initiative is the Urban Freight Consolidation Centre (UFCC), the benefits of which are significant. Its financial issues though represent a huge problem for public administrations. However, a large customer network, comprising retailers participating in the initiative, could make the UFCC a self-financing scheme. The key to expanding the scheme is closely linked with marketing campaigns and customer care. Therefore, customer care analysis represents an important tool in developing UFCC schemes. In this paper, a new Customer Satisfaction Index (CSI) is proposed for evaluating UFCC service quality. The new index, named CSImod, is a modified version of the traditional CSI, but places greater emphasis on customer dissatisfaction, so as to analyse the most critical areas of the service with a view to improving them. The index has been tested using experimental data collected within the CIVITAS RENAISSANCE Project, in which the Bristol and Bath Freight Consolidation Centre (BBFCC) scheme was evaluated. The evaluation was done from a user perspective, i.e. the participating retailers. The CSImod places more importance on the most dissatisfied customers making it possible to understand why they are dissatisfied and with what. Thus, it is possible to intervene with the aim of improving those areas of the service that are perceived as the worst. In spite of the high level of satisfaction with the overall service provided by the BBFCC, thanks to the CSImod the analysis pointed out that some retailers are dissatisfied with the delivery time arrangements and also with deliveries that were getting wet, issues about which the BBFCC manager was totally unaware. The CSImod could be used by UFCC operators to extend the network of the retailers involved and could therefore provide an implicit solution for making the scheme self-financing. © 2016 Vilnius Gediminas Technical University (VGTU) Press.","customer satisfaction; customer satisfaction index; freight scheme evaluation; modified customer satisfaction index; transport policy; urban freight consolidation centre","Finance; Freight transportation; Marketing; Public administration; Sales; Urban planning; Urban transportation; Customer dissatisfaction; Customer satisfaction indices; Freight consolidations; Negative externalities; Protection of the environments; Scheme evaluation; Transport policy; Transportation impacts; Customer satisfaction","Andreassen, T.W., Lindestad, B., The effect of corporate image in the formation of customer loyalty (1998) Journal of Service Research, 1 (1), pp. 82-92. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/109467059800100107; Bhave, A., Customer satisfaction measurement (2002) Quality & Productivity Journal: February 2002., , http://www.symphonytech.com/articles/pdfs/satisfaction.pdf, Available from Internet:; Browne, M., Sweet, M., Woodburn, A., Allen, J., (2005) Urban Freight Consolidation Centres.

However, few studies have examined how retail stores perceive the services a UCC could provide. The purpose of this paper is to explore retail stores’ potential demands for different services that a UCC could provide in order to foster the development and implementation of UCC solutions aimed towards more economically feasible business models. Design/methodology/approach: Structured interviews were conducted with employees at 72 retail stores. Qualitative, as well as quantitative analyses, were conducted to identify the potential demands of the retail stores. Findings: The authors have provided arguments why retail stores might be interested in UCC services, and thereby potentially pay for them. Improved customer service to stores’ customers might not be a valid argument. The authors point to the cost aspect: stores expend resources that a UCC could provide in a more cost-efficient manner. Research limitations/implications: The findings contradict previous studies to some extent, as it indicates that a UCC may actually not enhance customer service in retail stores. Instead, the findings point to the importance of considering the potential advantages according to economies of scale that are facilitated by UCC services. Practical implications: Taking the perspective of the stores is important in order to identify arguments for why they should pay for the services provided by a UCC. Social implications: Financially viable UCC solutions are needed in order for the initiatives to be maintained and thereby provide a long-term decrease in the environmental and social footprints caused by urban freight. Originality/value: This study answers the call for research addressing retailers’ perspective in urban logistics, as it takes a demand-driven perspective of the development of UCC services. Furthermore, by highlighting services requested by retail stores, it can guide the financing of UCC initiatives, an aspect that has been lacking. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Business model;

One of the most important issues is the optimization of the interconnection amongst the interurban and urban sections of the supply chain, where the role of the Freight Transport Interchanges (i.e. Freight Centers) has been fundamental. The key issue is three fold and the optimum solution lies between: a) the selection of the most appropriate location for the establishment of each facility, b) the identification of the facility's attributes that should match the interest area's needs and c) the evaluation of the concept as considered to be part of the local policies and measures promoted or planned for the area of interest. The answer to the afore mentioned issues is provided through a two level approach incorporating the development of two discrete, but successive decision making supportive evaluation tools: a methodological approach to provide a solution to the facility location problem for Freight Centers and an integrated evaluation framework used for the assessment of the operation of the specific Freight Center category, the Urban Consolidation Centers (UCC). Both methodological frameworks are based on selected performance indicators, incorporating divergent stakeholders' interests considering conflicting business models and operations. © 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","evaluation framework; optimization; stakeholders; urban consolidation centre; urban freight transport","Freight transportation; Optimization; Supply chains; Evaluation framework; Facility location problem; Methodological approach; Methodological frameworks; Performance indicators; stakeholders; Urban consolidation; Urban freight transport; Urban transportation","Allen, J., Browne, M., Woodburn, A., Leonardi, J., The role of urban consolidation centres in sustainable freight transport (2012) Transport Reviews, 32 (4), pp. 473-490; (2008) Quantification of Urban Freight Transport Effects II, , BESTUFS Del. 5.2; Browne, M., Sweet, M., Woodburn, A., Allen, J., (2005) Urban Freight Consolidation Centres, , Final Report for the Department for Transport.

By reviewing, this research systemises the current state of urban freight transportation and its relevant issues to provide a more solid basis for further research opportunities. This research examines that current challenges are primarily related to urban sprawl, lack of scientific data, financial concerns and stakeholder acceptability. Moreover, legal, practical and ecological barriers are highly important both for the field of urban freight as well as for the implementation of urban consolidation centres (UCCs). Solutions to overcome the defined issues are provided e.g., the need of detailed planning and establishing credible business models. Based on this review, areas of concern and the impact of possible new changes are identified. Solutions are provided as well as the importance of implementing flexible policies, restrictions and preferences regarding urban freight.

This relatively recent concept responds to the need for feasible and sustainable last mile logistics solutions that contribute to reductions on not only costs but on congestion and environmental effects, particularly in dense cities. Decisions on a supply level involve network design, which includes urban facilities location. In this context facilities are called urban or city distribution centers, micro distribution centers, satellites platforms or just satellites. On other hand, vehicle fleet related decisions need to be also customized to this particular urban distribution context, specifically dealing with multi-mode selection, fleet size, smaller vehicle capacities (i.e. city-freighters), power technology, vehicle autonomy, and inclusive, vehicle design, etc. Literature suggests there is still an opportunity in terms of optimization modeling and methodologies to address these issues. This work revises the drivers motivating the topic, the last mile distribution network elements, and establishes an explicit connection between urban network design and the actual development and use of more environmental and suitable vehicles for urban freight. © 2017 IEEE.","Distribution networks;

Despite the potential positive environmental and social impact, the main obstacle remains the lack of a sustainable business model. The goal of this paper is to understand how to organize UCC viability as a concept providing environmental and social benefits while at the same time providing a sustainable business model (social and logistical value propositions of multi-beneficial relations between the involved stakeholders). A research framework will be designed to analyse and evaluate financial viable UCCs. The framework consists of four main stream components, namely: organizational integration, revenue streams, key-resource provisioning and buyer-supplier relation. These four types of relations result in the so called ORKB-framework to analyse the created added value. The research framework is applied and evaluated for the following urban consolidation centres: Regent Street in London, Bristol/Bath, and BinnenStadService in Nijmegen. With the development of the framework we want to reveal some of the uniqueness for each specific situation in order to address the UCC-environment more effectively when the dynamics regarding value creation and the needs of the involved stakeholders are better understood. © 2016 The Authors.","business modelling; last mile delivery; Urban consolidation centre",,"Allee, V., Value network analysis and value conversion of tangible and intangible assets (2008) Journal of Intellectual Capital, 9 (1), pp. 5-24; Allen, J., Thorne, G., Browne, M., (2007) BESTUFS Good Practice Guide on Urban Freight Transport, , Brussels: Bestufs Consortium; Ballon, P., Business modelling revisited: The configuration of control and value (2007) Info, 9 (5), pp. 6-19; Balm, S., Browne, M., Leonardi, J., Quak, H., Developing an evaluation framework for innovative urban and interurban freight transport solutions (2014) Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences, 125, pp. 386-397; Baumol, W.J., Vinod, H.D., An inventory theoretic model of freight transport demand (1970) Management Science, 10 (7), pp. 413-421; Browne, M., Sweet, M., Woodburn, A., Allen, J., (2005) Urban Freight Consolidation Centres London, , Transport Studies Group, University of Westminster; Bryson, J., What to do when stakeholders matter (2004) Public Management Review, 6 (1), pp. 21-53; Casciaro, T., Piskorski, M., Power Imbalance Mutual Dependence, and Constraint Absorption: A closer look at resource dependence theory (2005) Administrative Science Quarterly, 50, pp. 167-199; Chesbrough, H., Rosenbloom, R.S., The role of the business model in capturing value from innovation: Evidence from Xerox Corporation's technology (2002) Industrial and Corporate Change, 11 (3), pp. 529-555; De Reuver, M., Bouwman, H., Haaker, T., Business model road mapping (2013) International Journal of Innovation Management, 17 (1), pp. 1-18; De Vos, H., Haaker, T., STOF Model: Critical Design Issues and Critical Succes Factors (2008) Mobile Service Innovation and Business Models, pp. 71-88. , H.

Layout of the distribution centers is very important in terms of product conservation at the required service level and delivering of products with minimum cost to the customer from distribution centers. Therefore, the layout design of distribution centers should be handled with a smart decision system. In this study, the layout design of a fruits and vegetable hall, which is a kind of urban distribution center, is investigated for two different scenarios: (1) assignments of the brokers to the stores and (2) assignments of the products to the stores.

Urban consolidation centers (UCCs) have been set up to facilitate such consolidation all over the world. To the best of our knowledge, most - if not all - of the UCCs operate on volume-based fixed-rate charges. To achieve environmental sustainability while ensuring economic sustainability in urban logistics, we propose, in this paper, a bicriteria auction mechanism for the automated assignment of last-mile delivery orders to transport resources. We formulate and solve the winner determination problem of the auction as a biobjective programming model. We then present a systematic way to generate the Pareto frontier to characterize the tradeoff between achieving economic and environmental sustainabilities in urban logistics. Finally, we demonstrate that our proposed bicriteria auction produces the solutions that significantly dominate those obtained from the fixed-rate mechanisms. Our sensitivity analysis on the willingness of carriers to participate in the UCC operation reveals that higher willingness is favorable toward achieving greater good for all, if UCC is designed to be nonprofit and self-sustaining. © 2016 IEEE.","Environmental economics; logistics; multi-agent systems; sustainable development; urban pollution","Sensitivity analysis; Urban transportation; Auction mechanisms; Automated assignments; Bi-objective programming; Economic sustainability; Environmental sustainability; Transport resources; Urban consolidation; Winner determination problem; Sustainable development","Rodrigue, J.-P., Comtois, C., Slack, B., The 'last mile' in freight distribution (2009) The Geography of Transport Systems, , 2nd ed.

The aim is to locate a set of urban distribution centers (UDCs) and to connect them via a ring in which massive flows of goods will circulate. Goods are transported from gates located outside the city to a UDC, and either join a second UDC through the ring before being delivered in electric vans to the final customers or are delivered directly to the customers from the first UDC. The reverse trip with pickup and transportation to the gates is also possible. A delivery service path starts at a particular UDC, then visits a subset of customers and ends at the same UDC, another UDC, or a self-service parking lot (SPL). A pickup route can start from an SPL or a UDC and ends at a UDC. The objective is to minimize the sum of the installation costs of the ring, flow transportation costs, and routing costs. The MRLRP belongs to the class of location-routing problems (LRP). We model it with a set-partitioning-like representation of delivery and pickup trips and arc-flow elements to describe goods transportation in the ring and between the ring and the gates. We present three approaches to solving the MRLRP: an exact method for small-size instances, a matheuristic for instances of a larger size, and a hybrid approach that applies the exact method to the columns output by the matheuristic. Numerical results are provided for an exhaustive set of instances, obtained by extending benchmark instances of the capacitated LRP with additional MRLRP features. © 2016 INFORMS.","City logistics; Combinatorial optimization; Matheuristics; Mixed-integer programming","Benchmarking; Combinatorial optimization; Costs; Integer programming; Location; Pickups; Reconfigurable hardware; Sales; Trucks; City logistics; Goods transportation; Location routing problem; Matheuristics; Minimization problems; Mixed integer programming; Transportation cost; Urban distribution centers; Distribution of goods","Akça, Z., Berger, R.T., Ralphs, T.K., A branch-and-price algorithm for combined location and routing problems under capacity restrictions (2009) Operations Research and Cyber-Infrastructure, Oper.

It is believed to bring cost savings and environmental benefits with the right setting. This paper demonstrates an alternative modeling framework to examine, from the strategic planning perspective, the effectiveness of urban delivery consolidation in terms of monetary logistics cost, energy consumption and PM2.5 emissions with respect to a number of operational (e.g., rent cost, customer demand) and policy factors (e.g., commercial vehicle size restriction in city centers). The framework consists of two key modeling components: the Continuous Approximation (CA) method to model urban delivery (the so-called last-mile delivery) and the Motor Vehicle Emission Simulator (MOVES by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency) to estimate the energy consumption and PM2.5 emissions associated with the logistics activities. It is found that the potential logistics and environmental benefits of UCC could come from either improving the utilization of the vehicle capacity through consolidation, or shifting the more expensive storage cost from customers in the city center to the less expensive UCC rent cost—due to a less centralized location and/or government subsidy or other cost sharing mechanisms—outside of the city center. However, UCC could achieve those benefits compared to non- consolidation strategies only under certain conditions, for example when there is an economy of scale or high customer density (i.e., high shipping volume) in the service area. The paper discusses in detailed under what assumptions and conditions UCC could work. Study limitations and future work are also presented. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Continuous approximation (CA); Energy consumption; Logistics cost; MOVES; PM2.5; Urban consolidation center (UCC)","Commercial vehicles; Cost effectiveness; Costs; Economics; Energy policy; Energy utilization; Environmental impact; Environmental protection; Environmental Protection Agency; Sales; Sustainable development; Vehicles; Continuous approximations; Environmental benefits; Environmental impact analysis; Logistics costs; Motor vehicle emissions; MOVES; U.S. Environmental Protection Agency; Urban consolidation; Cost benefit analysis","Ando, N., Taniguchi, E., Travel time reliability in vehicle routing and scheduling with time windows (2006) Netw Spat Econ, 6, pp. 293-311; Beardwood, J., Halton, J.H., Hammersley, J.M., The shortest path through many points (1959) Math Proc Camb Philos Soc, 55 (4), pp. 299-327; http://www.bestufs.net/results.html, BESTUFS (2007) Good practice guide on urban freight, available online at.

In these urban terminals, freight flows from interurban carriers are consolidated and transferred to a neutral last-mile carrier to perform final deliveries. This operation would reduce both last-mile fleet size and average distance cost. Our UCC modeling approach is focused on continuous analytic models for the general case of carriers with different market shares. Savings are highly sensitive to the design of the system: the increment of capacity in interurban vehicles and the proximity of the UCC terminal to the area in relation to current distribution centers. An exhaustive collection of possible market shares distributions are discussed. Results show that market shares distribution does not affect cost savings significantly. The analysis of the proposed model also highlights the trade-off between savings in the system and a minimum market share per company when the consolidation center is established. © 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.","analytic mathematical model; logistics; Urban consolidation center; urban freight transport",,"Issues and Problems of Moving Goods in Urban Areas (1998) J.

Results demonstrate that different locations of UDC correspond to different costs and environmental implications. It is suggested that a new UDC for the sugar commodity can be located at the east part of the city outskirt.Using more than two UDCs in the studied case appears to be not economically and environmentally beneficial. © The Author(s) 2016.","Combined approach; Multi-objective mixed-integer linear programming; Spatial analysis; Urban distribution center",,"Dablanc, L., City distribution, a key element of the urban economy: guidelines for practitioners (2011) City distribution and urban freight transport: multiple perspectives, pp. 13-36. , In: Macharis C and Melo S (eds) Northampton: Edward Elgar Publishing; Urban freight transport and logistics-an overview of the European research and policy Report of the European Commission, , Brussels: European Union; Chen, C., A fuzzy approach to select the location of the distribution center (2001) Fuzzy Sets Syst, 118 (1), pp. 65-73; Cui, G., Li, Y., Study on the location of distribution center: a genetic algorithm combining mechanism of simulated annealing (2004) In: Proceeding of 2004 international conference on machine learning and cybernetics, pp. 2601-2606. , Shanghai, China, 26-29 August Shanghai, China: IEEE; Drezner, Z., Hamacher, H., (2002) Facility location: application and theory, , Berlin: Springer; Klose, A., Drexl, A., Facility location models for distribution system design (2005) Eur J Oper Res, 162 (1), pp. 4-29; Farahani, R.Z., Hekmatfar, M., (2009) Facility location: concepts, models, algorithms and case studies, , Heidelberg: Physica- Verlag; Gonzalez-Feliu, J., (2008) Models and methods for the city logistics: the two-echelon capacitated vehicle routing problem, , Dissertation, Politecnico di Torino, Torino; Xiaohui, L., The site selection of distribution center based on linear programming transportation method (2012) In: Proceeding of the 10th world congress on intelligent control and automation, pp. 3538-3542. , 6-8 July Beijing, China; Daganzo, C.F., (1996) Logistics system analysis, , Berlin: Springer Verlag; Ko, J., (2005) Solving a distribution facility location problem using an analytical hierarchy process approach, , In: ISAHP, Honolulu, Hawai, 8-10 July; Zak, J., Weglinski, S., The selection of the logistics center location based on MCDM/A methodology (2014) In: Transportation research procedia, 17th Meeting of the EURO Working Group on Transportation, EWGT2014, 3, pp. 555-564. , 2-4 July Sevilla, Spain; Rao, C., Goh, M., Zhao, Y., Location selection of city logistics center under sustainability (2013) Transport Res, 36, pp. 29-44; Bai, L., Chen, X., Choice making on distribution locations of logistics center based on fuzzy multi-criteria decision making theor In: International conference on communications and intelligence information security (ICCIIS), 2010, pp. 17-22. , 13-14 October Nanning Guangxi, China; Awasthi, A., Chauhan, S.S., Goyal, S.K., A multi-criteria decision making approach for location planning for urban distribution center under uncertainty (2011) Math Comput Model, 53, pp. 98-109; Alam, S.A., (2013) Evaluation of the potential locations for logistics hub: a case study for a logistics company, , Thesis, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Sweden; Lindawati, N.S., Sijie, H., Eriadi, W.A., Widodo, K.H., Goh, M., de Souza, R., (2014) Spatial decision support system (SDSS) for urban freight transportation policy planning, TLI-AP White paper Series, , Singapore: TLI-AP (The Logistics Institute-Asia Pacific); Rosita, M., Pujawan, I.N., Arvitrida, I.N., (2011) Simulasi Sistem logistik perkotaan untuk memenuhi pasokan barang ke ritel modern di surabaya dengan penambahan pusat distribusi, , Thesis, Institut Teknologi Sepuluh, Surabaya; Del Rosario Ṕerez-Salazar, M., Mateo-Diaz, N.F., Garcia-Rodriquez, R., A genetic algorithm to solve a threeechelon capacitated location problem for a distribution center within a solid waste management system in the northern region of Veracruz, Mexico (2015) DYNA, 82 (191), pp. 51-57; Zheng, Z., Zheng, Z., A logistics distribution center location method based on improved genetic algorit (2010) In: 2nd international conference on education technology and computer (ICETC), pp. 6123-6126. , 22-24 June Shanghai China; Drezner, Z., Scott, C.H., Location of a distribution center for a perishable product (2013) Math Methods Oper Res, 78 (3), pp. 301-314; (2014) Final report of traffic survey and performance, , volume and speed.

Recently, UCCs received a lot of attention as a solution to decrease the environmental impact of urban freight transport in the Brussels-Capital Region. However, despite the growing interest from both public and private actors, many questions regarding their practical implementation remain. In fact, there are a large number of uncertainties with regards to the implementation of the consolidation scenarios, such as the number, location and size of the UCC(s), the vehicle fleet, the regulatory and market framework or the operational agreements. This leads to a large number of possible scenarios. In this paper, authors describe a scenario-planning methodology that was applied in order to select a limited number of scenario themes. Authors present several quantitative models that were used to evaluate possible scenarios and select the most relevant ones. © 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.","scenario planning; strategic planning; urban consolidation centres; urban freight transport",,"Allen, J., Browne, M., Woodburn, A., Leonardi, J., The Role of Urban Consolidation Centres in Sustainable Freight Transport (2012) Transport Reviews, 32, pp. 473-490; Belouannas, F., (2014) MEDUSE: Marchandises et Etude de la Distribution Urbaine À St-Etienne «tous Acteurs de la Logistique Urbaine»; Börjesson, M., Eliasson, J., Hugosson, M.B., Brundell-Freij, K., The Stockholm congestion charges - 5 years on (2012) Effects, Acceptability and Lessons Learnt.

Among all available solutions, Urban Consolidation Centre is an appreciated one. Indeed, it is supposed to reduce pollution, trucks' congestion and to improve the livelihood of city centre. Nevertheless, it is far from obvious that UCC are efficient and viable. The aim of this study is to provide answers to two questions: can an UCC be viable? Does the shape of a city affect the profitability of an UCC?

Despite the potential positive environmental and social impact, the main obstacle remains the lack of a sustainable business model. Therefore UCCs are often heavily subsidised and tend to disappear as soon as the subsidies stop. This paper reports on a social cost-benefit analysis (SCBA) of an operational UCC in the Belgian city of Antwerp. The SCBA is based on real data and volumes. It concerns a private initiative that is not dependent upon subsidies and is located in an area with considerable problems (e.g., average delays of 28%). Results show that the consolidated deliveries are beneficial for society. Based on current volumes during the start-up period it is, however, not financially viable. The business volume lies considerably higher. This study shows that there is potential to reach a break-even turnover. Outcomes are linked to the transferability of the concept to other urban areas. © 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.","City Logistics; Social Cost-Benefit Analysis; Transferability; Urban consolidation centre",,"Anderson, S., Allen, J., Browne, M., Urban logistics - How can it meet policy makers' sustainability objectives?

The TSDSM model is based on the integration of the multi-criteria method of Weighted Linear Combination (WLC) and the modified Dijkstra algorithm within a geographic information system (GIS). The GIS is used for processing spatial data. The proposed model makes it possible to plan routes for green vehicles and maximize the positive effects on the environment, which can be seen in the reduction of harmful gas emissions and an increase in the air quality in highly populated areas. The scheduling of delivery vehicles is given as a problem of optimization in terms of the parameters of: the environment, health, use of space and logistics operating costs. Each of these input parameters was thoroughly examined and broken down in the GIS into criteria which further describe them. The model presented here takes into account the fact that logistics operators have a limited number of environmentally friendly (green) vehicles available. The TSDSM was tested on a network of roads with 127 links for the delivery of goods from the city logistics center to the user. The model supports any number of available environmentally friendly or environmentally unfriendly vehicles consistent with the size of the network and the transportation requirements. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","City logistics; Dijkstra; Geographic information system; Green logistics; Green vehicle; Vehicle routing","Air quality; Contracts; Data handling; Decision support systems; Gas emissions; Geographic information systems; Information systems; Operating costs; Transportation; Transportation routes; Vehicle routing; Vehicles; City logistics; Dijkstra; Dijkstra algorithms; Green logistics; Multi-criteria method; Spatial Decision Support; Transportation requirements; Weighted linear combinations; Logistics; air quality; algorithm; data processing; decision support system; emission; GIS; Green function; greenbelt; optimization; road transport; spatial analysis; transport vehicle","Adiba, B.I., Elhassania, M., Ahemed, H., A hybrid ant colony system for green capacitated vehicle routing problem in sustainable transport (2013) J.

Being the sources and sinks of transport activities, Europe's cities are strongly affected by the resulting undesirable effects of transportation. This applies in particular to North West Europe (NWE), one of the most urban regions in Europe. NWE therefore stands in urgent need of solutions for efficient urban freight logistics. Focusing on the last mile of freight deliveries the INTERREG IVB NWE project LaMiLo (Last Mile Logistics) addressed this issue. The project promoted Urban Consolidation Centres (UCCs) as they allow and encourage transport consolidation as well as modal shift. Decoupling the last mile at the city borders, large vehicles are used for bundled, long haul transports outside the city whilst sustainable transport means are used inside. In the knowledge that UCC attempts with huge government subsidies have been made several times before but rarely succeeded, the core of the LaMiLo project was to enable environment for UCC operations that accomplish a sustainable last mile and can as well be transformed in successful business models. Thereto, UCC concepts were operationalised and implemented in a number of pilots in metropolitan areas and cities all around NWE:Paris: A UCC was field-tested to which freight was brought by truck and afterwards delivered by cargo bikes.Netherlands: Central hubs were put into operation to streamline the home delivery of parcels. Thereto, a Freight Circle service was launched in the cities of Nijmegen and Maastricht which used e-bikes and enabled customer-specific delivery times.London: A UCC was set up to bundle goods for the public sector which were destined for the boroughs of Camden and its partners Enfield and Waltham.Brussels: A UCC was launched at the Port of Brussels offering warehouse services and deliveries to retailers in the city. The key results gained from the studies primarily include the demonstration of UCCs as possible last mile solutions. Beyond their economic performance, their environmental effects as well as their social impacts were evaluated. Exemplary results include that all the pilots contributed towards emission reduction and total distance travelled through city centres and residential areas. Gained best practice and lessons learnt about the examined UCC concepts were discussed and shared at transnational level to encourage relating solutions for further cities. © 2016 The Authors.

It is evident that urban freight distribution requires innovative solutions that are capable of improving the efficiency of transport whilst promoting innovative use of renewable energy, thus reducing energy consumption and associated GHG emissions while adopting and not stifling economic development. In this context, six Mediterranean cities (Barcelona, Bologna, Piraeus, Rijeka and Valencia)) collaborated with the purpose of contributing to the improvement of energy efficiency on urban freight transport as part of the SMILE Project (2015) (SMart green Innovative urban Logistics Models for Energy efficient mediterranean cities project), funded by the MED Programme. The SMILE project aims to improve the energy efficiency of Mediterranean cities through the promotion of innovative 'green' and cost effective solutions for urban freight logistics, addressing the target of green and smart urban development. This paper shows the results of the live test of smart city urban logistics solutions in the cities of Barcelona and Valencia that consisted of combining the use of electric tricycles and Transhipment terminals (or Urban Consolidation Centres) for the last-mile delivery of parcels and small shipments. A thoughtful analysis of the quantitative outcomes of the pilot test in both cities are presented from different perspectives: economical, operational, energy efficiency, environmental and social. © 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.","Case studies; Cooperative freight transport systems; Electric tricycles; Innovative solution; Last mile distribution; Smart cities; Urban consolidation centres smart cities; Urban delivery; Urban freight transport",,"(2007) Good Practice Guide on Urban Freight Transport, , http://www.bestufs.net/, BESTUFS European Commission, 6th Framework Programme for Research and Technological Demonstration; Kawamura, K., Lu, Y., Evaluation of delivery consolidation in U.S. Urban areas with logistics cost analysis (2007) Transportation Research Record: Journal of the Transportation Research Board, pp. 34-42. , No.2008, Transportation Research Board of the National Academies, Washington, DC; Roca-Riu, M., Estrada, M., An Evaluation of Urban Consolidation Centers through Logistics Systems Analysis in Circumstances where companies have equal market shares (2012) Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences, 39, pp. 796-806. , Special issue of the Seventh International Conference on City Logistics, Mallorca, Spain; (2015) SMart Green Innovative Urban Logistics Models for Energy Efficient Mediterranean Cities Project), Funded by the MED Programme, , http://smile-urbanlogistics.eu/, SMILE Accessed on 1 st January 2015; (2014) Strategies and Measures for Smarter Urban Freight Solutions.

With Singapore's mild restrictions on the vehicle types or the time windows for the last-mile delivery, we believe that with proper technology in place, an Urban Consolidation Center like the Tenjin Joint Distribution System in Fukuoka Japan may be implemented to achieve cost reduction with some degree of privacy preservation. Participating carriers keep their respective private orders and have the option to get their remaining shareable orders consolidated with those from the other carriers' fleet. To this end, we propose in this paper a double auction mechanism that enables such consolidation with an objective to maximize the total cost savings attained by all participating carriers. Our experimental results on 5 zones of delivery in Singapore CBD demonstrate that the proposed double auction is able to bring about reductions in the number of inter-zone travels, thereby producing cost savings to the participating carriers. © 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.","Collaborative Urban Logistics; Double Auction; Order Sharing; Urban Consolidation Center",,"Agarwal, R., Ergun, O., Ship scheduling and network design for cargo routing in liner shipping (2008) Transportation Science, 42 (2), pp. 175-196; Agarwal, R., Ergun, O., Network design and allocation mechanisms for carrier alliances in liner shipping (2010) Oper.

However, the process of establishing UCC as a demonstration measure within the set time frame was ultimately stopped without success. By using the experiences from this process, the paper provides a more solid basis for renewed efforts at implementation in the future. With basis in implementation theory, the study identifies key barriers to implementation of UCC. Findings indicate that the barriers are primarily related to financial concerns and stakeholder acceptability. However, institutional, practical and legal barriers are also of significance. Strategies to overcome the identified barriers are suggested, most importantly the need for establishing a credible and sound business model. The study makes use of perspectives from political science regarding implementation theory in order to facilitate urban freight policy. As such, it represents a novel scholarly approach in the field of urban freight research. The evaluation framework can be useful for similar studies to come and for policymakers in the design and implementation of new policy measures for urban freight. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Barriers; Implementation; Stakeholders; Transport policy; Urban consolidation center","freight transport; policy implementation; policy making; stakeholder; transportation policy; urban transport; Norway; Oslo [Norway]; Oslo [Oslo (CNT)]","Arampatzis, G., Kiranoudis, C.T., Scaloubacas, P., Assimacoupoulos, D., A GIS-based decision support system for planning urban transportation policies (2004) Eur.

Integrating the economic, environmental, and social dimensions of sustainable development, this paper presents a new evaluation system for the location selection of a CLC from a sustainability perspective. A fuzzy multi-attribute group decision making (FMAGDM) technique based on a linguistic 2-tuple is used to evaluate potential alternative CLC locations. In this method, the linguistic evaluation values of all the evaluation criteria are transformed into linguistic 2-tuples. A new 2-tuple hybrid ordered weighted averaging (THOWA) operator is presented to aggregate the overall evaluation values of all experts into a collective evaluation value for each alternative, which is then used to rank and select alternative CLC locations. An application example is provided to validate the method developed and to highlight the implementation, practicality, and effectiveness by comparing with the fuzzy Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) method. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","City logistics centers; Location selection; Sustainability; THOWA operator; TOPSIS","Computational linguistics; Decision making; Linguistics; Logistics; Supply chain management; Application examples; City logistics; Fuzzy multi attribute group decision makings (FMAGDM); Location selection; Logistics and supply chain management; Ordered weighted averaging; THOWA operator; TOPSIS; Sustainable development; decision making; fuzzy mathematics; logistics; sustainability; sustainable development; urban planning; urban transport","Aardal, K., van den Berg, P.L., Gijswijt, D., Li, S.F., Approximation algorithms for hard capacitated k-facility location problems (2015) Eur.

This system reduces the demand for private car or taxi for economic savings. Public transport will not only reduce the use of private vehicles, but it will also reduce traffic and air pollution. The public transportation system of buses seems to be the excellent as one of the most efficient form of the public transportation systems. Bus terminals play an important role in the regulation of urban transportation. However, these terminals have the potential to become sources of air pollution. The mathematical model can easily estimate emissions of terminal vehicles and concentrations of pollutants. By alternative methods of sampling and measurement model, it can be possible to review existing situation and to anticipate the future in a more quick and costless way. If needed, it can be subject to examination and sampling. The purpose of this study is to assess the risks the persons in those terminals are faced with. These persons are including drivers, office workers and travelers to the area. The air pollutants CO, NO2, and SO2 are presented at the terminals by modeling and PM10 Payments. Materials and Methods: IVE model is designed to estimate emissions from motor vehicles. The purpose of the model is to control strategies and transportation planning, to predict how different strategies will affect local emissions, and to measure progresses for reduction of emissions over time. Input data of this model are vehicle types, number of vehicles, their presence time in terminal, engine type, age, exhaust control technology, fuel type and speed. Moreover, other data are the essential geographical and meteorological information collected by documents review, questionnaires and statistical modeling. According to the traffic in the terminal and at different hours of the day, the average amount of estimated emissions of air for NO2, PM10, CO and SO2 were determined. This is one of the BREEZE AERMOD inputs. Terminal resource modeling for air pollutants to a level that is unevenly spread is also considered. In this way, surface coordinates and the release of three terminals are needed. Some field works were required for more accurate determination of concentrations of air pollutants concentration. Concentrations of air pollutants in the desired period of time were estimated without taking into account the effects of air pollutants at the terminal air pollution monitoring stations near the terminals. Exposure to the range of terminal points was needed to determine how the output data set is analyzed. Finally, the required parameters and output were set in a given period of time. After completing all the input data, the model was run with known concentrations of air pollutants. Two groups of people were directly exposed to air pollutants in the terminal. A group was the drivers and terminal staff that were highly subject to the air pollutants and the other group was the passengers with different patterns of exposure to air pollutants. In this research, we used risk assessment method of RAIS from USEPA. Results and Discussion Emissions of air pollutants and their concentrations in the IVE model and BREEZE AERMOD model have been used for risk assessment. Air pollution emissions are calculated by IVE model. The output data of IVE model is used as the input data for the BREEZE AERMOD model which estimates the concentration of pollutants. Finally, the cancer and non-cancer risk of CO, NO2, SO2 and PM10 concentrations is calculated by the RAIS, which is achieved by the use of non-cancer and cancer risk assessment of pollutants, quantitative assessment of risks from inhaled pollutants and persons that are affected. Searches performed for the pollutants of NO2, CO and SO2 gradients cancer is currently not available. Only the cancer risk of PM10 has been calculated by its cancer slope factor. After calculation of the cancer risk for the population, the cancer risk is multiplied by the number of people in contact. Inhalation of hazardous air pollutants per passenger in Beihaghi Terminal and HQmhale results for the different groups are shown in Table 1. (Table Presented) The non-carcinogenic hazard quotient estimated for CO express that the most HQ is for site personnel with 2.81, this exceed the unit. If the quotient is less than 1, then the systemic effects are assumed not to be of concern; if the hazard quotient is greater than 1, then the systemic effects are assumed to be of concern. HQ for official personnel is 2.16 and for drivers is 1.32, both more than unit. Therefore, these three groups of people are in risk of CO inhalation. The HQ estimated for passengers is 0.117 which is less than unity and they are not in risk of CO inhalation. The NO2 HQ estimated for drivers is 2.367 who are in the most risk in comparison to the other groups. The HQ for site personnel is 1.94 and for official personnel 1.49, which is more than unity. Thus, these people are in risk for NO2 inhalation in the passenger terminal. The SO2 HQ for drivers is estimated about 0.0369, for site personnel 0.0837, for official personnel 0.0641, and for the passengers 0.0035. These are less than unity for all groups of people. None of people in the passenger terminal are in the risk for SO2 inhalation and non-carcinogenic risk. The PM10 hazard quotient for all groups of people is less than unity and no one is in the non-carcinogenic risk of this pollutant. The hazard index is the sum of hazard quotients. Hazard Index is calculated by adding hazard quotients for each chemical across all exposure routes. Hazard index for the drivers is 3.737, for site personnel 4.838, for official personnel 3.718, and for passengers 0.202. Consequently, the site personnel are in great risk in this transportation terminal. This population is in the open area and exposed to vehicle exhaust emissions. The official personnel and drivers are also prone to the effects of non-carcinogenic risks of these contaminants. Drivers have the same situation to the site personnel but with the different frequency of contact. Official personnel at the terminal work 8 hours a day in the buildings, but due to indirect emissions from vehicles. The risk Index indicates a low risk of inhalation of air pollutants for passengers in the terminal. The CO pollutant has the greatest share of risk which is 58 percent and then the NO2 with 40 percent in the passenger terminal. Conclusion: In this research, risk assessment based on concentrations of inhaled air pollutants is modeled by BREEZE AERMOD. Hazard index for drivers of all air pollutants is the most for site personnel and the least for passengers 0.202. The risk inhalation of air pollutants is minimal for passengers in the terminal. Most persons working in the Beihaghi Terminal and the drivers are at the non-cancer risks. Pollutants are the greatest share of the risks are emissions of NO2 and CO. Share of NO2 emissions is 64 percent and share of CO emission is 35 percent of the whole pollution in the Terminal. Cancer risk assessment using cancer slope is appeared only for particulate matter emission. Carcinogenic risk assessment for PM10 is estimated to be for the population inhaled. The risk of PM10 inhalation for the drivers is high, meaning that 3 of them may suffer from cancer in their lifetime. There is also risk for carcinogen illnesses for one of the site personnel and of the passengers in their lifetime. Therefore, the drivers are exposed to most of the cancer risks. In general, in this terminal the risk of cancer is highly increased.","AERMOD model; Air pollution; City terminal; IVE model; Risk assessment",,"Adams, H.S., Nieuwenhuijsen, M.J., Colvile, R.N., Determinants of fine particle (PM2.5) personal exposure levels in transport microenvironments (2001) Atmospheric Environment; EPA, (2002) A Review of Reference Dose and Reference Concenteration Progress, , U.S. EPA.

At the UCC, goods are consolidated based on their destinations prior to their deliveries into city centers. Typically, a UCC owns a fleet of ecofriendly vehicles to carry out such deliveries. Shippers/carriers that make use of the UCC’s service hence no longer need to be restricted by timewindow and vehicle-type regulations. As a result, they retain the ability to deploy large trucks for the economies of scale from the source to the UCC which is located outside the city center. Furthermore, the resources which would otherwise be spent in the city center can then be utilized for other purposes. With possibly tighter regulation and thinning profit margin in near future, requests for UCC’s services will become more and more common, and there is a need for a market mechanism to allocate UCC’s resources to provide sustainable services for shippers/carriers in a win-win fashion. An early work of our research team (Handoko et al., 2014) proposed a profit-maximizing auction mechanism for the use of UCC’s last-mile delivery service. In this paper, we extend this work with an idea of rolling horizon to give bidders more flexibility in competing for the UCC’s resources in advance. In particular, it addresses the needs of many shippers/carriers to be able both plan deliveries weeks ahead and at the same time bid for the UCC’s service at the last minute.

The indications laid down by the European Union (UE) urge us to review urban spaces in order to transform degraded areas into smart areas and, therefore, restart a process of rebalancing and sustainability, with the goal of transforming cities into smart cities. The planning activity supports the social, economic, and technological change processes. The regeneration of disused areas creates opportunities for sustainable growth. This paper presents the issue of urban regeneration. A project of an urban distribution center, in a city logistics system, is designed for a disused railway area, located near the harbour in Reggio Calabria.

It is estimated to be responsible for 25% of CO<inf>2</inf> emissions and up to 50% of particles matters generated by the transport sector in cities. Facing that problem, the European Commission set the objective of reaching free CO<inf>2</inf> city logistics by 2030 in major urban areas. In order to achieve this goal, electric vehicles could be an important part of the solution. However, this technology still faces a number of barriers, in particular high purchase costs and limited driving range. This paper explores the possible integration of electric vehicles in urban logistics operations. In order to answer this research question, the authors have developed a fleet size and mix vehicle routing problem with time windows for electric vehicles. In particular, an energy consumption model is integrated in order to consider variable range of electric vehicles. Based on generated instances, the authors analyse different sets of vehicles in terms of vehicle class (quadricycles, small vans, large vans, and trucks) and vehicle technology (petrol, hybrid, diesel, and electric vehicles). Results show that a fleet with different technologies has the opportunity of reducing costs of the last mile.

In more detail, a new terminal has the potential for influencing urban transport strategies, environmental aspects, infrastructure development, city logistics, freight transport, port and city interaction, and life cycle management. In light of the above facts, the objectives of this study were confined into the preliminary analysis of the life cycle cost (LCCA) associated to several hypotheses in terms of geometric design and pavement design of a new city terminal. Hypotheses included: A) the choice of the location of the freight terminal (close to railway track, motorway and port of a town having a population of about two hundred thousand people); b) layout and main heavy vehicle paths from/to the terminal; c) equipment; d) main operations; e) dynamic and static loads of equipment; f) pavement design alternatives, construction and quality assurance. Under the above hypotheses, a life cycle cost analysis has been carried out, including rehabilitation alternatives, resurfacing alternatives, analysis period, salvage value, interest and inflation assumptions, present value derivation. Based on the results obtained, rehabilitation options emerged as a key factor in the minimization of the overall life cycle cost in terms of present values. Results can benefit both researchers and practitioners. © 2015 WIT Press.","City logistics; Freight terminal; Life cycle cost analysis; Pavement; Port; Urban distribution centre; Urban transport",,"(2011), Freight Facility Location Selection: A Guide for Public Officials, Transportation Research Board, Washington, D.C. 2011; Praticò, F.G., Puppala, A.J., Lime and Cement Treatments of Subgrades in Southern Italy (2012) Procedia – Social and Behavioral Sciences, , Facing Interports Issues And Challenges, SIIV – 5th International Congress – Sustainability of Road Infrastructures, issn: 1877-0428; Rice, D., (2011) Intermodal Freight Connectors: Pavement Condition, Update, January 2011, , http://www.cmap.illinois.gov/documents/10180/27573/Intermodal-Connectors-Pavement-Condition-Update_January-31-2010_final.pdf/a5f0cff6-87af-4608-a3ae-9869098d2d18,2009, CMAP Congestion Management Process; Amodeo, L., Lamari, D., Musolino, G., Placido, V., Polimeni, A., Praticò, M., Vitetta, A., An ex-ante evaluation of last-mile freight distribution services for city logistics In WIT (2015) Transactions on the Built Environment, 146, pp. 1746-4498. , Digital ISSN: 1743-3509; Russo, F., Rindone, C., D’Agostino, P., Lanciano, C., Scattarreggia, T., Long distance freight transport to the provisioning of a city logistics (2015) Transactions on the Built Environment, 146. , ISSN: 1746-4498, Digital ISSN: 1743-3509; Gattuso, D., Cassone, G.C., Lanciano, C., Placido, V., Praticò, M., A freight urban distribution center design with micro-simulation support for city logistics (2015) . in WIT Transactions on the Built Environment, 146. , ISSN: 1746-4498, Digital ISSN: 1743-3509; Panuccio, P., Amodeo, L., D’Agostino, P., Lamari, D., Scattarreggia, T., Urban regeneration and smart city according EU strategies: Urban distribution center in city logistics (2015) Transactions on the Built Environment, 146. , ISSN: 1746-4498, Digital ISSN: 1743- 3509; Crist, M.T., Pavement Design for Containerized Cargo Terminals, , http://www.secement.org/PDFs/8%20CRIST%20-%20RCC%20at%20NIT.pdf,2005, February, 2015; (2006) Container Terminal and Intermodal Rail Yard Operational Area Consideration for Pavement Design, , http://www.portoflosangeles.org/pdf/Port_Pavement_Design_Guide.pdf; Praticò, F.G., Moro, A., D’Agostino, P., An experimental investigation on innovative pavements for city logistics (2015) Transactions on the Built Environment, 146. , ISSN: 1746-4498, Digital ISSN: 1743- 3509; Boyd, B., (2002) Roller Compacted Concrete CN Intermodal Project, , fromhttp://www.standardgeneraledmonton.ca/site/sge/content/file/CNIntermodal.pdf., March, 2015; Ishai, I., Yaacobi, S., Brown-Cohen, S., Design And Construction Of Concrete Block Pavements For Heavy Duty Railway Freight Terminal International Conference on Concrete Block Paving, , http://www.sept.org/techpapers/1360.pdf, San Francisco, California USA, November 6–8, 2006; Van Leeuwen, H., Use of block paving in European ports, Proc 1St Int.

A city logistics system introduced in an urban area is studied. The arriving freight, from national origins, is investigated, considering different modal alternatives. Different transport mode services and relative models to estimate principal attributes (times, costs and prices), are considered. The aim of the paper is to compare attributes modelled and revealed of different mode-service alternatives for long distance freight transport. An application in a real context is carried out, considering the city of Reggio Calabria in the south of Italy.

However, it generates also inefficiencies on social, economic and environmental aspects. A possible solution is the use of urban distribution centres in order to rationalise the deliveries and to operate the last miles with clean vehicles. Electric vehicles are gaining attention lately but some barriers remain. Since costs barriers were already investigated, the paper aimed at evaluating the difference of performances between a centre using a diesel truck and a centre using an electric vehicle. In order to do so, the operations of an urban distribution centre were modelled in a discrete event simulation and different scenarios were evaluated. The results showed that replacing a conventional truck by an electric van generates more traffic due to the limited payload of the van. However, the limited range does not entail the daily operations of the vehicle since a single night charge is sufficient. Better, the depth of discharge is found to be limited to a minimum of 60%. The results on the battery are similar in the second scenario where the conventional truck is replaced by an electric truck. In that scenario though, no influences are identified on the logistics performances of the urban distribution center. © 2013 IEEE.","city logistics; discrete event simulation; electric vehicle; urban distribution center","Electric discharges; Electric vehicles; Freight transportation; Geographical distribution; Trucks; Urban transportation; Warehouses; City logistics; Depth of discharges; Diesel truck; Electric truck; Environmental aspects; Urban distribution; Urban distribution centers; Urban freight transport; Discrete event simulation","(2011) European Investment Bank, , Shaping sustainable cities, Luxembourg; (2007) World Urbanization Prospects-The 2007 Revision, , New York; Anderson, S., Allen, J., Browne, M., Urban logistics-how can it meet policy makers' sustainability objectives?

Although several case studies have indicated that FCCs are beneficial to the operation of urban transportation systems, the implementation of this concept has proven difficult because the construction and operation of a FCC involves the coordination of different, and conflicting, stakeholders. Unlike other traditional approaches, this paper investigates the FCC development issue using experimental economics. First, profit functions are defined for involved stakeholders; based on those profit functions, four players-carriers, operators, government, and residents-bid on rent, financial incentives, and wages to maximize their own profits. Eight scenarios are analyzed and compared to determine potential influential factors and appropriate conditions for FCC decision making. Results show that public-private partnership lowers rent and increases wages, which leads to higher carrier, operator, and resident profits. A central location lowers rent, wages, financial incentives, and all stakeholders' profits. A larger carrier size benefits all stakeholders. In conclusion, the appropriate conditions for FCC development are public-private partnerships in noncentral locations with large carrier sizes. © 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Decision-making process; Experimental economics; Freight consolidation center","Decision making process; Experimental economics; Financial incentives; Freight consolidations; Influential factors; Public private partnerships; Traditional approaches; Urban transportation systems; Decision making; Transportation; Urban planning; Wages; Profitability; conceptual framework; decision making; freight transport; public-private partnership; stakeholder; transportation development; transportation economics; transportation planning; transportation system; urban transport","Abelairas-Etxebarria, P., Astorkiza, I., Farmland prices and land-use changes in periurban protected natural areas (2012) Land Use Policy, 29 (3), pp. 674-683; Arnott, R., de Palma, A., Lindsey, R., A structural model of peak-period congestion: A traffic bottleneck with elastic demand (1993) Am.

Over time, a growing number of road freight vehicles have delivered less freight over longer distances, while average load factors have been reduced. This development is unsatisfactory, as transport capacity that could have been used more efficiently is lost. To mitigate negative impact, it has been suggested that freight consolidation and better planned localisation of freight consolidation centres (FCCs) would improve city logistics. Based on primary data, this paper investigates the potential to establish urban FCCs intended for small road hauliers (SRHs) delivering goods to the retail sector in a wider geographical area, the Gothenburg region in Sweden. While the findings show that a large majority of SRHs could reach potential FCC locations in a short time, congestion affects deliveries and several factors, many of which were observed already in the 1970s, restrict FCC establishments. Under present conditions, there is little scope for SRHs to successfully deliver goods to retailers in the Gothenburg region from FCCs; therefore, a more efficient urban transport system from a business or societal perspective is unlikely. Policy makers need to take into consideration the different segments, requirements, and characteristics of different cities before venturing into costly FCC projects. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Efficiency; Freight consolidation centre; Gothenburg region; Load factors; Localisation","development project; freight transport; road transport; transportation development; transportation policy; urban transport; Goteborg; Sweden; Vastra Gotaland","Amin, A., Thrift, N., (2002) Cities.

The paper draws on the experiences of the Bristol-Bath freight consolidation centre (BBFCC), established in 2002 to serve Bristol city centre and uniquely extended in 2011 to cover Bath, each served by electric lorries; it appraises the benefits of shared 'final mile' freight services, presenting a model for the evaluation of the reduction in traffic and polluting emissions based on Bristol, with a view to optimising future UFCC design. Data about the number of deliveries made by heavy goods vehicles (HGVs) of different types to the BBFCC and the number of deliveries made from the BBFCC to the two shopping centres covering a period of 17 months are analysed. The correlation between the type and number of HGVs delivering to the BBFCC and the number of deliveries made to the retailers by the BBFCC is explicated by means of a multiple linear regression model. Its development is based on analysing parameters as R Square value (total and adjusted), F-statistics and p-values for each coefficient. An estimation of the number of HGVs re-routing to the BBFCC and the pollutant emissions avoided in the urban centre is appraised. The pollutant emissions reduction is based on factors drawn from the UK National Atmospheric Emissions Inventory. Results suggest that the proposed approach may yield HGV movements avoided in Bristol city centre of 75.5% on average. Also, by considering the whole study period, reductions amount calculated is equivalent to 28,677 Kg of CO2, 122.29 Kg of NOx, 2.31 Kg of PM10, 20.32 Kg of CO and 9,854 Kg of fuel. Nevertheless, emissions reductions are significant, but currently limited by small scale, due to the low number of participants. Emissions reductions in the host cities are identified as a result of sharing delivery vehicles for the final leg. The regression model showed high correlation coefficient values (over 85%) for deliveries to the Bristol city centre thanks to the BBFCC. The linear regression models developed provide a useful tool for local authorities and logistics/transport planners in optimising the planning of UFCCs to reduce freight traffic, associated emissions and to improve logistics and transport performance. © 2014 The Authors.","Polluting Emissions; Sustainable Freight Transport; Urban Freight Consolidation Centres (UFCCs)",,"Browne, M., Woodburn, A., Allen, J., Evaluating the potential for urban consolidation centres (2007) European Transport, 35, pp. 46-63; Chopra, S., Designing the distribution network in a supply chain (2003) Transportation Research Part e, 39, pp. 123-141; Demir, E., Bektaş, T., Laporte, G., A review of recent research on green road freight transportation (2014) European Journal of Operational Research, 237 (3), pp. 775-793; Figliozzi, M.A., Vehicle routing problem for emissions minimization (2010) Transportation Research Record: Journal of the Transportation Research Board, 2197 (1), pp. 1-7; Haghshenas, H., Vaziri, M., 2012 Urban sustainable transportation indicators for global comparison (2012) Ecological Indicators 15., 1, pp. 115-121; Kim, N.S., Janic, M., Van Wee, B., Trade-off between carbon dioxide emissions and logistics costs based on multiobjective optimization (2009) Transportation Research Record: Journal of the Transportation Research Board, 2139 (1), pp. 107-116; Lindholm, M.E., Blinge, M., Assessing knowledge and awareness of the sustainable urban freight transport among Swedish local authority policy planners (2014) Transport Policy, 32, pp. 124-131; Maden, W., Eglese, R.W., Black, D., Vehicle routing and scheduling with time-varying data: A case study (2010) Journal of the Operational Research Society, 61 (3), pp. 515-522; Melo, S., Baptista, P., Costa, Á., Comparing the Use of Small Sized Electric Vehicles with Diesel Vans on City Logistics (2014) Procedia-Social and Behavioral Sciences, 111, pp. 350-359; Nuzzolo, A., Crisalli, U., Comi, A., A trip chain model for simulating urban freight restocking (2012) European Transport, p. 50; Pan, S., Ballot, E., Fontane, F., The reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from freight transport by pooling supply chains (2010) International Journal of Production Economics, 143 (1), pp. 86-94; Russo, F., Comi, A., A classification of city logistics measures and connected impacts (2010) The Sixth International Conference on City Logistics.

At the UCC, goods are consolidated based on their destinations prior to their deliveries into the city centre. In many examples, the UCC owns a fleet of eco-friendly vehicles to carry out the deliveries. A carrier/shipper who buys the UCC's service hence no longer needs to enter the city centre in which time-window and vehicle-type restrictions may apply. As a result, it becomes possible to retain the use of large trucks for the economies of scale outside the city centre. Furthermore, time which would otherwise be spent in the city centre can then be used to deliver more orders. With possibly tighter regulation and thinning profit margin in near future, requests for the use of the UCC's service shall become more and more common. In [1], the authors proposed a profit-maximizing auction mechanism for the use of the UCC's last-mile delivery service. In this paper, we extend that work with the idea of a rolling horizon to give bidders greater flexibility in competing for the UCC's resources in advance. In particular, it addresses the challenge that many shippers/carriers plan their deliveries many weeks ahead, and simultaneously allows last-minute bidders to compete for the UCC's resources. © 2014 IEEE.",,"Economics; Fleet operations; Delivery service; Eco-friendly; Economies of scale; Maximizing auctions; Profit margin; Rolling horizon; Time windows; Urban consolidation; Profitability","Handoko, S.D., Nguyen, D.T., Lau, H.E., An auction mechanism for the last-mile deliveries via urban consolidation centre (2014) Proceedings of 2014 IEEE International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering; Quak, H., Tavasszy, L., Customized solutions for sustainable city logistics: The viability of urban freight consolidation centres (2011) Transitions Towards Sustainable Mobility, , Springer; Regan, A.E., Song, J., (2003) Combinatorial Auctions for Transportation Service Procurement: T He Carrier Perspective, , Technical Report, University of California Transportation Center; Agarwal, R., Ergun, O., Network design and allocation mechanisms for carrier alliances in liner shipping (2010) Operations Research, 58 (6), pp. I726-1742; Ozener, O.O., Ergun, O., Allocating costs in a collaborative transportation procurement network (2008) Transportation Science, 42 (2), pp. l46-165; Agarwal, R., Ergun, O., Ship scheduling and network design for cargo routing in liner shipping (2008) Transportation Science, 42 (2), pp. 175-196; Sethi, S., Sorger, G., A theory of rolling horizon decision making (1991) Annals of Operations Research, 29, pp. 387-416; Mula, J., Poler, R., Garcia-Sabater, J.P., Lario F, E., Models for production planning under uncertainty: A review (2006) International Journal of Production Economics, pp. 271-285; Chand, S., Hsu, V.N., Sethi, S., Forecast, solution, and rolling horizons in operations management problems: A classified bibliography (2002) Manufacturing & Service Operations Management, 4 (1), pp. 25-43; Ouelhadj, D., Petrovic, S., A survey of dynamic scheduling in manufacturing systems (2009) Journal of Scheduling, 12 (4), pp. 417-431; Berbeglia, G., Cordeau, J.-F., Nd Laporte G, A., Dynamic pickup and delivery problems (2002) European Journal of Operational Research, (1), pp. 8-15; Wang, X., Kopfer, H., Dynamic collaborative transportation planning: A rolling horizon planning approach (2013) Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 8197, pp. 128-142; Andersson, H., Hoff, A., Christiansen, M., Hasle, G., Lpkketangen, A., Industrial aspects and literature survey: Combined inventory management and routing (2010) Computers & Operations Research, 37, pp. 1515-1536","Proc.

As a result, it becomes possible to retain the use of large trucks for the economies of scale outside the city centre. Furthermore, time which would otherwise be spent in the city centre can then be used to deliver more orders. With possibly tighter regulation and thinning profit margin in near future, requests for the use of the UCC's service shall become more and more common. In this paper, we propose a profit-maximizing auction mechanism for the use of the UCC's service. We first formulate the winner determination problem as mixed-integer program (MIP). Then, we provide a greedy approximation algorithm to solve the MIP in reasonable time. Our experiments indicate that the proposed auction along with the greedy approximation algorithm is able to maximize the UCC's profit to near optimality with reasonable computational budget. © 2014 IEEE.",,"Amphibious vehicles; Budget control; Economics; Fleet operations; Integer programming; Profitability; Auction mechanisms; Computational budget; Economies of scale; Greedy approximation algorithms; Maximizing auctions; Mixed-integer programs; Urban consolidation; Winner determination problem; Approximation algorithms","Quak, H., Tavasszy, L., Customized solutions for sustainable city logistics: The viability of urban freight consolidation centres (2011) Transitions Towards Sustainable Mobility, , Springer; Regan, A.C., Song, J., (2003) Combinatorial Auctions for Transportation Service Procurement: The Carrier Perspective, Technical Report, , University of California Transportation Center; Agarwal, R., Ergun, O., Network design and allocation mechanisms for carrier alliances in liner shipping (2010) Operations Research, 58 (6), pp. 1726-1742; Özener, O.O., Ergun, O., Allocating Costs in a Collaborative Transportation Procurement Network (2008) Transportation Science, 42 (2), pp. 146-165; Agarwal, R., Ergun, O., Ship scheduling and network design for cargo routing in liner shipping (2008) Transportation Science, 42 (2), pp. 175-196; Dawande, M., Approximation algorithms for the multiple knapsack problem with assignment restrictions (2000) Journal of Combinatorial Optimization, 4 (2), pp. 171-186; Chekuri, C., Khanna, S., A polynomial time approximation scheme for the multiple knapsack problem (2005) SIAM Journal on Computing, 35, pp. 713-728; Shmoys, D.B., Tardos, E., An approximation algorithm for the generalized assignment problem (1993) Mathematical Programming, 62, pp. 461-474; Yamada, T., Takeoka, T., An exact algorithm for the fixed-charge multiple knapsack problem (2009) European Journal of Operational Research, 192 (2), pp. 700-705","IEEE Int.

These customer demands have increased the competition between businesses, and at the same time more complicated and longer supply chains have emerged as a result of the globalization of many businesses in their search for low-cost production locations and access to new skills. In response, hub-and-spoke systems are increasingly used to deal with product flows from many origins and to many destinations. As a result, a growing number of studies have examined the establishment of various forms of intermodal transshipment centers to minimize the use of roads in city centers and support the frequent and rapid replenishment of goods at retail and catering outlets. This study examined the establishment of a consolidation center servicing nearly 100 businesses that operated in an urban shopping mall in Southampton, United Kingdom. Through the review of numerous existing UK and international consolidation schemes and the examination of their operational characteristics, the study aimed to identify potential strengths, weaknesses, and risks that would impact the operation of the consolidation center. Various operational scenarios considering business take-up combinations, vehicle delivery mixes, fill rates, and back-load practices were examined to elucidate the potential transport and environmental effects of the consolidation scheme. To quantify and to verify these effects accurately, a multistage analysis framework, including data collection, map routing, emissions assessment, and scenario-building activities, was developed.",,"Costs; Crashworthiness; Sales; Supply chains; Analysis frameworks; Customer demands; Freight consolidations; Hub-and-spoke system; Operational characteristics; Operational scenario; Scenario building; Urban distribution systems; Competition","Higginson, J.K., Bookbinder, J.H., Policy recommendations for a shipment consolidation program (1994) Journal of Business Logistics, 15 (1), pp. 87-112; Higginson, J.K., Recurrent decision approaches to shipment-release timing in freight consolidation (1995) International Journal of Physical Distribution and Logistics Management, 25 (5), pp. 3-23; Cetinkaya, S., Bookbinder, J.H., Stochastic models for the dispatch of consolidated shipments (2003) Transportation Research Part B: Methodological, 37 (8), pp. 747-768; Zhou, G., Van Hui, Y., Liang, L., Strategic alliance in freight consolidation (2011) Transportation Research Part E: Logistics and Transportation Review, 47 (1), pp. 18-29; Browne, M., Sweet, M., Woodburn, A., Allen, J., (2005) Urban Freight Consolidation Centres, , Publication Transport Studies Group, University of Westminster, London; Klaus, P., German experiences with urban consolidation centres-do they have a future role?

This paper considers the problem of locating urban distribution centers and proposes an exact method, based on integer linear programming for strategic, tactical and operational decision-making. The aim is to solve, in an integer manner, location, sizing and operation (vehicle routing) problems in these logistics platforms. The model is validated using real-data taken from the city of SaintÉtienne, France. Computational experiments are also carried out in order to compare the proposed model with existing procedures from the literature.

We focus on two categories of UDCs: those deployed to deliver to the city and located in peripheral areas and those located close to a specific area to serve it. Starting from an initial typology of experiments, obtained from a systematic analysis of 34 experiences (18 in France and 16 in Italy), we orient the study towards the analysis of six models of cooperative strategies set up to reach an economic viability of these platforms. Those models are studied on a four-element grid: steering, organization, development, and financing. The defined typology and the analysis of the six types of cases enabled us to determine the main elements that influence the search for economic viability in urban consolidation and distribution platforms. © KEDGE BS.","Cooperation strategies; Financial balance; Micro-consolidation; Urban distribution centers",,"Allen, J., Browne, M., Woodburn, A., Leonardi, J., The role of urban consolidation centers in sustainable freight transport (2012) Transport Reviews, 32 (4), pp. 473-490; BESTUFS, (2009) BESTUFS II Bibliografic Overview, , Rijswijk: Bestufs; Boudouin, D., (2006) Guide méthodologique: Les Espaces Logistiques Urbains, , Paris: La documentation française; Boudouin, D., Morel, C., (2002) Logistique Urbaine: l’optimisation De La Circulation Des Biens Et Service En Ville.

A UCC is a logistics facility that is situated in relatively close proximity to the area that it serves. Goods destined for this area are dropped off at the UCC, and are sorted and consolidated onto goods vehicles for delivery to their final destinations, often using environmentally friendly vehicles such as electric and gas-powered goods vehicles, and electricallyassisted cycles. The development of UCCs since their first appearance in the 1970s is reviewed and the various types of UCC categorised. The freight transport and logistics advantages offered by UCCs are discussed. Case studies of four recent UCC trials are included. The objectives, operational and financial aspects and impacts of these UCCs are compared and their critical success factors identified. © 2014, IGI Global.",,,"Attlassy, M., (2005) The tricycle experimentation in Paris ""la Petite Reine, , University of Westminster; Avison, R., (2007) DHL hopes to expand airport consolidation centre, RoadTransport. com, 24 July 2007, , http://www.roadtransport.com/Articles/2007/07/24/127981/DHL-hopes-to-expandairport-consolidation-centre.htm, Retrieved December 18, 2010, from; Avison, R., (2007) Making consolidation centres work, , http://www.roadtransport.com/Articles/2007/07/27/128022/Making-consolidation-centres-work.htm, RoadTransport.com, 27 July 2007, Retrieved December 18, 2010, from; Bastien, O., (2007) An Introduction to Retail Consolidation Centres, , presentation to the West London Freight Quality Partnership, 10th January 2007; Browne, M., Woodburn, A., Allen, J., Evaluating the potential for urban consolidation centres (2007) European Transport, 35, pp. 46-63; Browne, M., Woodburn, A., Sweet, M., Allen, J., (2005) Urban Freight Consolidation Centres, , http://www.freightbestpractice.org.uk/urban-freight-consolidation-centre-report, Report for Department for Transport, London: University of Westminster.

We identify that many solutions for urban logistics are, most of time, badly evaluated. Indeed, the theory often predicts a positive effect but the reality is most of time counterbalanced. We tried to fill this gap by making use of innovative methods. To do so, we mobilize several domains of knowledge: operational research, game theory and transportation studies on real cases.

Indeed, optimum UDC location plays a vital role in saving distribution costs and minimizing traffic congestion arising from freight movement. In this paper, we suggest a Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) approach to solve the Urban Distribution Center location /allocation problem under uncertain environment. The proposed approach involves identification of possible locations with the aim of selecting the smartest location for implementing an UDC. The ratings and the weight of each alternative and criterion are described by linguistic variables which can be expressed in triangular fuzzy numbers. The final evaluation value of each UDC location is also expressed using fuzzy logic theory. After calculating the difference of the final evaluation value between each pair of UDC location, a fuzzy preference relation matrix is constructed to show the degree of preferences of one plant location over another. After that, a smart ranking procedure is anticipated to determine the ranking order of all alternative locations. Finally, a numerical application is presented to illustrate the performance of the proposed approach. © 2013 IEEE.","fuzzy preferences; Fuzzy theories; Linguistic variable; Location selection; Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM); Urban Distribution Centers (UDC)","Fuzzy preferences; Fuzzy theory; Linguistic variable; Location selection; Multi-criteria decision making; Urban distribution centers; Decision making; Freight transportation; Fuzzy logic; Fuzzy sets; Linguistics; Logistics; Traffic congestion; Location","Anderson, S., Allen, J., Browne, M., Urban logistics: How can it meet policy maker's sustainability objectives (2005) Journal of Transport Geography, 13; Farahani, R.Z., Seifi, M.S., Asgari, N., Multiple criteria facility location problems: A survey (2010) Applied Mathematical Modelling, 34, pp. 1689-1709; Tuzkaya, G., Onut, S., Tuzkaya, U.R., Gulsun, B., An analytic network process approach for locating undesirable facilities: An example from Istanbul, Turkey (2008) Journal of Environmental Management, 88 (4), pp. 970-983. , DOI 10.1016/j.jenvman.2007.05.004, PII S0301479707001879; Aras, H., Erdogmus, S., Koc, E., Multi-criteria selection for a wind observation station location using analytic hierarchy process (2004) Renewable Energy, 29 (8), pp. 1383-1392. , DOI 10.1016/j.renene.2003.12.020, PII S0960148103004051; Badri, A.M., Combining the analytic hierarchy process and goal programming for global facility location-allocation problem (1999) Int.

However, it generates also inefficiencies on social, economic and environmental aspects. A possible solution is the use of urban distribution centres in order to rationalise the deliveries and to operate the last miles with clean vehicles. Electric vehicles are gaining attention lately but some barriers remain. Since costs barriers were already investigated, the paper aimed at evaluating the difference of performances between a centre using a diesel truck and a centre using an electric vehicle. In order to do so, the operations of an urban distribution centre were modelled in a discrete event simulation and different scenarios were evaluated. The results showed that replacing a conventional truck by an electric van generates more traffic due to the limited payload of the van. However, the limited range does not entail the daily operations of the vehicle since a single night charge is sufficient. Better, the depth of discharge is found to be limited to a minimum of 60%. The results on the battery are similar in the second scenario where the conventional truck is replaced by an electric truck. In that scenario though, no influences are identified on the logistics performances of the urban distribution center. © 2013 WEVA Page.","City logistics; Discrete event simulation; Electric vehicle; Urban distribution center","Amphibious vehicles; Electric discharges; Electric vehicles; Freight transportation; Geographical distribution; Trucks; Urban transportation; Vehicles; Warehouses; City logistics; Depth of discharges; Diesel truck; Electric truck; Environmental aspects; Urban distribution; Urban distribution centers; Urban freight transport; Discrete event simulation","(2011) Shaping sustainable cities, , Luxembourg; (2007) United Nations, World Urbanization Prospects - The 2007 Revision, , New York; Anderson, S., Allen, J., Browne, M., Urban logistics--how can it meet policy makers' sustainability objectives?

The idea behind the urban distribution center (DC) is to provide buffer points where cargo and packages which are to be delivered to shops and businesses can be stored beforehand. At these centers, there will be other kinds of routing problems corresponding to other fairly similar distribution problems. In this paper, a new vehicle routing model (based on the known Time-Dependent Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows, TDVRPTW) has been carried out and a change in the traditional approach is proposed, by adopting a system in which some customers are served by urban DCs while remaining customers are served by traditional routes. This study is also motivated by recent developments in real time traffic data acquisition systems, as well as national and international policies aimed at reducing concentrations of greenhouse gases emitted by traditional vans. By using k DCs, the whole problem is now composed of k+1 problems: one special VRPTW for each DC in addition to the main problem, in which some customers and k DC are serviced. The model has been tested by simulating one real case of pharmaceutical distribution within the city of Zaragoza. © 2009 The Author(s).","Distribution centers; Modelization; Time-dependent; Vehicle routing problem with time windows","Distribution centers; International policies; Modelization; Real-time traffic datum; Time-dependent; Traditional approaches; Urban distribution centers; Vehicle routing problem with time windows; Greenhouse gases; Sales; Trucks; Vehicle routing; Warehouses","Ando, N., Taniguchi, E., Travel time reliability in vehicle routing and scheduling with time windows (2006) Netw Spat Econ, 6, pp. 293-311; Bräysy, O., A reactive variable neighborhood search for the vehicle routing problem with time windows (2003) INFORMS J Comput, 15, pp. 347-368; Bräysy, O., Hasle, G., Dullaert, W., A fast local search algorithm for the vehicle routing problem with time windows (2003) Int J Artif Intell, 12, pp. 153-172; Casceta, E., Coppola, P., Intra-period (withing-day) dynamic models for continuous services (2003) Netw Spat Econ, 3, pp. 271-296; Cordone, R., Wolfler-Calvo, R., A heuristic for the vehicle routing problem with time windows (2001) J Heuristics, 7, pp. 107-129; Donati, A.V., Montemanni, R., Casagrande, N., Rizzoli, A.E., Gambardella, L.M., Time dependent vehicle routing problem with a multi ant colony system (2008) Eur J Oper Res, 185, pp. 1174-1191; Escuín, D., Millan, C., Larrodé, E., Sensitivity analysis of urban distribution based on a VRPSTW problem using cost functions and evaluation of solutions based on Urban Distribution Centres (UDCs) (2007) Transportation Research Record; Finnegan, C., Finlay, H., O'Mahony, M., Sullivan, D., Urban freight in Dublin City Centre, Ireland (2005) Transportation Research Record: Journal of the Transportation Research Board, 1906, pp. 33-41. , Transportation Research Board of the National Academies (2005) Washington, D.

An international literature review has identified 114 UCC schemes in 17 countries (12 in the European Union (EU) and 5 outside the EU) that have been the subject of either a feasibility study, trial or a fully operational scheme in the last 40 years. The period from 2006 to 2010 has been the most active 5-year period in terms of UCC study, trial and scheme generation since the first UCC study was carried out in the early 1970s. Five countries account for the majority of all the 114 UCC schemes identified: France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and the UK. The vast majority of UCCs serve either all or part of an urban area. Examples of UCCs serving a single property (such as an airport or shopping centre) and construction sites have also been identified. Key organizational, operational, and financial issues that are critical to the success of UCCs are discussed. The traffic and environmental impacts of UCC trials and fully operational schemes are also reviewed. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,"environmental impact; European Union; freight transport; greenhouse gas; sustainable development; traffic emission; transportation development; urban area; urban transport; France; Germany; Italy; Netherlands; United Kingdom","Attlassy, M., (2005) The tricycle experimentation in Paris ""la Petite Reine"", , University of Westminster, London: University of Westminster; Battilana, J., Hawthorne, I., (1976) Design and cost of a transhipment depot to serve Swindon town centre, , (Laboratory Report 741).

To reap the benefits of this more sustainable transport mode a few experiences in Europe have attempted to introduce innovative freight distribution schemes where rail is used. One of such schemes uses rail for the urban penetration leg. After having been consolidated in a centre located outside the urban area, goods are transported by shuttle trains to a centre located inside the central area (the multi-modal urban distribution centre - MUDC) and there are transferred to low-pollution road vehicles to reach their final destination. Other schemes use tramways. The paper provides a review of rail-based schemes which have been introduced in European cities. An in-depth assessment is provided of the scheme based on the use of a MUDC. The case study relates to the distribution of fish food in Rome. The environmental and energy benefits obtainable from the shift from the current road-only scheme to the MUDC scheme are estimated in physical and monetary units. An estimate is provided of the maximum public contribution that would still make the scheme beneficial for society as a whole, obtained as the difference between the social costs of the road-only scheme and those of the MUDC scheme.

A UCC is a logistics facility that is situated in relatively close proximity to the area that it serves. Goods destined for this area are dropped off at the UCC, and are sorted and consolidated onto goods vehicles for delivery to their final destinations, often using environmentally friendly vehicles such as electric and gas-powered goods vehicles, and electrically-assisted cycles. The development of UCCs since their first appearance in the 1970s is reviewed and the various types of UCC categorised. The freight transport and logistics advantages offered by UCCs are discussed. Case studies of four recent UCC trials are included. The objectives, operational and financial aspects and impacts of these UCCs are compared and their critical success factors identified. © 2012, IGI Global.",,,"(2005) The Tricycle Experimentation In Paris ""la Petite Reine"", , Attlassy, M. & University of Westminster, University of Westminster; Avison, R., (2007) DHL Hopes to Expand Airport Consolidation Centre, RoadTransport.com, 24 July 2007, , http://www.roadtransport.com/Articles/2007/07/24/127981/DHL-hopes-to-expand-airport-consolidation-centre.htm, Retrieved December 18, 2010, from; Avison, R., (2007) Making Consolidation Centres Work.

It is based on the before and after evaluation of a trial led by a major stationery and office supplies company in which urban freight deliveries in central London made from a depot in the suburbs using diesel vehicles were replaced with the use of an urban micro-consolidation centre located in the delivery area together with the use of electrically-assisted cargo tricycles and electric vans. The results show that the total distance travelled and the CO2eq emissions per parcel delivered fell by 20% and 54% respectively as a result of this delivery system. However, the evaluation has also indicated that the distance travelled per parcel rose substantially in the City of London delivery area as a result of the electric vehicles having far smaller load limits in both weight and volume compared with diesel vans. But, at the same time, the trial system was able to virtually eliminate CO2eq emissions per parcel delivered in the City of London. The trial proved successful from the company's perspective in transport, environmental and financial terms. The company therefore decided to continue the operation beyond the end of the trial with it being officially launched during 2010. © 2011 International Association of Traffic and Safety Sciences.","Electric vehicles; Freight transport; Greenhouse gas emissions; Logistics system; Urban consolidation centre","Delivery systems; Diesel vehicles; Freight deliveries; Freight traffic; Freight transport; Logistics system; Trial systems; Urban consolidation; Carbon dioxide; Environmental impact; Freight transportation; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Logistics; Trucks; Electric vehicles","Browne, M., Woodburn, A., Sweet, M., Allen, J., (2005) Urban freight consolidation centres, Report for Department for Transport (DfT), , http://www.freightbestpractice.org.uk/imagebank/Consolidation%20centres%20Finalreport%20Nov2005.pdf, Available at:, (accessed 25 November 2010); Browne, M., Woodburn, A., Allen, J., Evaluating the potential for urban consolidation centres (2007) European Transp., 35, pp. 46-63; Gonzalez-Feliu, J., Morana, J., Are city logistics solutions sustainable?

In this paper, we present a multi-criteria decision making approach for location planning for urban distribution centers under uncertainty. The proposed approach involves identification of potential locations, selection of evaluation criteria, use of fuzzy theory to quantify criteria values under uncertainty and application of fuzzy TOPSIS to evaluate and select the best location for implementing an urban distribution center. Sensitivity analysis is performed to determine the influence of criteria weights on location planning decisions for urban distribution centers.The strength of the proposed work is the ability to deal with uncertainty arising due to a lack of real data in location planning for new urban distribution centers. The proposed approach can be practically applied by logistics operators in deciding on the location of new distribution centers considering the sustainable freight regulations proposed by municipal administrations. A numerical application is provided to illustrate the approach. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Fuzzy TOPSIS; Location planning; Multi-criteria decision making; Urban distribution center","Distribution centers; Distribution costs; Evaluation criteria; Fuzzy theory; FUZZY TOPSIS; Goods movement; Location planning; Multi-criteria decision making; Municipal administration; Numerical applications; Urban areas; Urban distribution; Urban distribution centers; Decision making; Freight transportation; Fuzzy logic; Laws and legislation; Regional planning; Sensitivity analysis; Traffic congestion; Uncertainty analysis; Warehouses; Location","Zadeh, L.A., Fuzzy sets (1965) Information and Control, 8, pp. 338-353; Bellman, R.E., Zadeh, L.A., Decision making in a fuzzy environment (1970) Management Science, 17, pp. 141-164; Zimmermann, H.J., (2001) Fuzzy Set Theory and its Applications, , Kluwer, Academic Publishers, Boston; Zadeh, L.A., The concept of a linguistic variable and its application to approximate reasoning: I, II (1975) Information Sciences, 8, pp. 199-249. , 301-357; Aikens, C.H., Facility location models for distribution planning (1985) European Journal of Operational Research, 22, pp. 263-279; Daskin, M.S., Network and Discrete Location: Models, Algorithms, and Applications (1995) Wiley-Interscience Series in Discrete Mathematics and Optimization, , John Wiley & Sons, Chichester, New York, Brisbane, Toronto, Singapore; Hamacher, H.W., Nickel, S., Classification of location models (1998) Location Science, 6, pp. 229-242; Klose, A., Drexl, A., Facility location models for distribution system design (2005) European Journal of Operational Research, 162, pp. 4-29; Agrawal, S., Raghavendra, N., Tiwari, M.K., Goyal, S.K., A hybrid Taguchi-immune approach to optimize an integrated supply chain design problem with multiple shipping (2010) European Journal of Operation Research, 203 (1), pp. 95-106; Sun, H., Gao, Z., Wu, J., A bi-level programming model and solution algorithm for the location of logistics distribution centers (2008) Applied Mathematical Modelling, 32 (4), pp. 610-616; Lee, S.M., Green, G.I., Kim, C., A multiple criteria model for the location-allocation problem (1981) Computers and Operations Research, 8, pp. 1-8; Puerto, J., Fernandez, F.R., Multicriteria mini-sum facility location problems (1999) Journal of the Multicriteria Decision Analysis, 8, pp. 268-280; Ross, G.T., Soland, R.M., A multicriteria approach to location of public facilities (1980) European Journal of Operational Research, 4, pp. 307-321; Erkut, E., Karagiannidis, A., Perkoulidis, G., Tjandra, S.A., A multicriteria facility location model for municipal solid waste management in North Greece (2008) European Journal of Operational Research, 187 (3), pp. 1402-1421; Carlsson, C., Fuller, R., Fuzzy multiple criteria decision making: recent developments (1996) Fuzzy Sets and Systems, 78, pp. 139-153; Anagnostopoulos, K., Doukas, H., Psarras, J., A linguistic multicriteria analysis system combining fuzzy sets theory, ideal and anti-ideal points for location site selection (2008) Expert Systems with Applications, 35 (4), pp. 2041-2048; Ishii, H., Lee, Y.L., Yeh, K.Y., Fuzzy facility location problem with preference of candidate sites (2007) Fuzzy Sets and Systems, 158 (17), pp. 1922-1930; Yang, L., Ji, X., Gao, Z., Li, K., Logistics distribution centers location problem and algorithm under fuzzy environment (2007) Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics, 208 (2), pp. 303-315; Kahraman, C., Ruan, D., Dogan, I., Fuzzy group decision-making for facility location selection (2003) Information Sciences, 157, pp. 135-153; Liang, G.S., Wang, M.J.J., A fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making method for facility site selection (1991) International Journal of Production Research, 29 (11), pp. 2313-2330; Chen, C.T., A fuzzy approach to select the location of the distribution center (2001) Fuzzy Sets and Systems, 118, pp. 65-73; Chou, S.Y., Chang, Y.H., Shen, C.Y., A fuzzy simple additive weighting system under group decision making for facility location selection with objective/subjective attributes (2008) European Journal of Operational Research, 189 (1), pp. 132-145; Chu, T.C., Facility location selection using fuzzy TOPSIS under group decisions (2002) International Journal of Uncertainty, Fuzziness and Knowledge-Based Systems, 10 (6), pp. 687-701; Lee, K.-L., Lin, S.-C., A fuzzy quantified SWOT procedure for environmental evaluation of an international distribution center (2008) Information Sciences, 178 (2), pp. 531-549; Buckley, J.J., Ranking alternatives using fuzzy numbers (1985) Fuzzy Sets Systems, 15 (1), pp. 21-31; Dubois, D., Prade, H., The use of fuzzy numbers in decision analysis (1982) Fuzzy Information and Decision Processes, pp. 309-321. , North-Holland, M.M.

A UDC is a logistic site dedicated to decompose and consolidate freight directed to the city, by planning the routes and service time, restricting the traffic of trucks and increasing the load factor of feeder vehicles. A UDC can produce interesting impacts on the dynamics of urban freight distribution, but its success depends on many factors: an appropriate location; a wellbalanced presence of spaces and equipment; an efficient and effective organization of internal services; a connection with the surrounding area and with the related transport services; a management structure that meets different and complementary requirements; a capacity to support itself. The paper proposes an analysis of the functional organization of a UDC through a ""what if"" micro-simulation approach aimed at the UDC efficiency control. After a review of the state of the art, a procedure to implement a discrete-event micro-simulation model is described. Probability functions concerning the times of UDC activities are proposed. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Efficiency; Probability function; Simulation model; UDC","Crashworthiness; Discrete event simulation; Efficiency; Electron transitions; Freight transportation; Functional organization; Management structure; Microsimulation models; Probability functions; Simulation model; Transport services; Urban distribution centers; Urban freight distribution; Urban transportation","Aickelin, U., Adewunmi, A., Optimization of crossdocking distribution centre simulation model Proceedings of the 2008 International Simulation Multi-Conference (SCS), , San Diego, USA; Aickelin, U., Adewunmi, A., Simulation optimization of the cross dock door assignment problem Proceedings of the 2006 or Society Simulation Workshop; Boysen, N., Fliedner, M., Scholl, A., Scheduling inbound and outbound trucks at cross docking terminals (2010) OR Spectrum, 32, pp. 135-161; Boysen, N., Fliedner, M., Scholl, A., Scheduling inbound and outbound trucks at cross-docking terminals OR Spectrum 2008; Bozer, Y., Carlo, H., Optimizing inbound and outbound door assignments in less-than-truckload crossdocks (2008) IIE Transactions, 40, pp. 1007-1018; Da Rios, G., Gattuso, D., (2003) La Mobilità Delle Merci Nell'area Metropolitana Milanese, , ED.

Increasing demands of the recipients (due to e-commerce development) leads to pressure and intensification of transporting freight through inner-city areas. This generates many unwanted results such as congestion, escalation of waste and environmental devastation, increased noise levels, greater than before, such as the risk of car accidents. An important alternative for traditional freight delivery are Urban Consolidation Centres. Utilizing UCC gives a chance to eliminate the harmful effects due to transporting freight by large-size vehicles through the city areas. This paper is focused on analysis of perspectives of urban consolidation centres development in Westpomeranian Region of Poland, concentrating on medium-size cities.

The consolidation centre in Nijmegen differs from initiatives in the past, distinguishing itself from other UCC initiatives by its focus on receivers rather than on carriers. After one year already 98 stores joined Binnenstadservice.nl and this number is still growing. Due to Binnenstadservice.nl, fewer trucks enter the city centre and fewer kilometres are driven. In this paper we provide insights into the local effects of the Binnenstadservice pilot after one year, such as air quality, inconvenience for residents and noise nuisance. The effects on local air quality and noise nuisance are limited, due to the amount of passenger and bus traffic remaining. Plans exist to start Binnenstadservice.nl franchises in other Dutch cities, which could result in making Binnenstadservice.nl a more serious partner for carriers to handle the transport of last mile distribution in cities. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

To determine factors that caused the success or failure of UCCs in practice, a survey of 6 cases in Europe is conducted. The cases were selected because of the similarity of the service area of the UCC and the city centre of The Hague or because of the uniqueness of the UCC. To determine the possible success for a UCC in The Hague four scenarios are evaluated. Two major difficulties with implementing the UCC are the allocation of the costs and benefits and the willingness to cooperate of the transportation companies. Both consignees and transportation companies can benefit financially from using the UCC. The UCC operator, however, incurs the costs. The municipality should play a role in bringing the costs and benefits together. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

In order to understand the supportive value of this methodology we have analyzed the effects of a new main road for public transport connecting several small cities combined with a new solution for freight problems in these towns. The new solution encompasses the development of a new public warehouse.

A review of the current structure and size of the hotel industry in London is included, together with growth forecasts. Survey work carried out at London hotels provides detailed insight into the sourcing arrangements and supplier selection policies used by respondents. This illustrates that the use of multiple suppliers for specific product categories is widespread among respondents. Stockholding facilities are also considered inadequate at many of the hotels surveyed. The results show that there is a large variation in the number of goods vehicle deliveries received by hotels. The delivery arrangements of many of the hotels result in deliveries taking place on-street and causing disruption and disturbance to neighbours. There would appear to be much potential scope for consolidation of deliveries and the use of a consolidation centre in the hotel industry in London. However, respondents show relatively little interest in the concept. © 2008 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Because there are no revealed preference data, a stated-choice methodology is used. The stated-choice experiments present two alternatives - one using a private vehicle subject to various traffic regulations and one using the urban freight consolidation centre with varying cost and efficiency levels. Conventional discrete choice data modelling shows that the potential demand is influenced mainly by the distance of the parking bay from the shop, by access permit cost, by the service cost of the urban freight consolidation centre, and by the delay in delivery time. Simulations are then performed to assess how the potential demand is affected by various incentives and regulations affecting urban goods distribution. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC. 2007.","City logistics; Stated preference; Transport demand analysis; Urban freight consolidation centre (UFCC); Urban goods distribution","Cargo handling; Computer simulation; Distribution of goods; Logistics; Urban planning; City logistics; Stated preference; Transport demand analysis; Urban freight consolidation curve; Urban goods distribution; Freight transportation; computer simulation; decision making; demand analysis; discrete choice analysis; freight transport; modeling; planning method; travel behavior; urban transport; Denmark; Eurasia; Europe; Fano; Frisian Islands; North Frisian Islands; Northern Europe; Ribe; Scandinavia","Bradley, M.A., Daly, A.J., Estimation of logit choice models using mixed stated preference and revealed preference information (1992) Proceedings of the 6th International Conference on Travel Behavior, , Quebec; D'Elia, S., Festa, D.C., Mazzulla, G., Urban freight distribution in Cosenza, Italy.

A relay star network is characterized by the properly that there is a unique communication path between any two nodes; that is, the graph of the network is a rooted tree. In this article we present a tutorial discussion of relay star networks using examples and an extended discussion of a protocol for wireless data collection on relay star networks. The target application for this work is data collection on networks of fixed low-cost, low-data-rate environmental monitors such as urban terminals (parking meters, pay telephones, fire alarm boxes, distress call stations, etc.) and utility meters (water, electricity, gas, steam, etc.).",,"Cost effectiveness; Data acquisition; Maintenance; Network protocols; Radio links; Relay star network; Urban terminals; Utility meters; Wireless relay networks; Telecommunication networks","Binder, R., ALOHA Packet Broadcasting - A Retrospect (1975) Proc. 1975 AFIPS Nat'l.
