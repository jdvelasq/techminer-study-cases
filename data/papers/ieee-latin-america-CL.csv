As urbanising cities face the double threats of urban food insecurity and land scarcity, multi-functional urban land uses that integrate rather than separate agriculture from other land uses could be a critical adaptation for the sustainability of future cities. With less than 1% of land in agricultural use, the high-density, city-state of Singapore is testing integrative approaches to where and how food can be grown in the city. The shift toward land use multiplicity is prompting cross-agency collaboration in policy development. The aims of this paper were to map changes in agricultural use of land and describe emerging policy trends in Singapore related to cross-agency collaboration and land use multiplicity. Given growing global attention to urban food policy, Singapore is a timely example where policies support integrated urban food production through high-tech intensification, a model AgriFood Innovation Park, and promotion of industrial and commercial land uses toward efficient and value-added activities that include urban farms. More examples of agriculture co-located with other land uses are needed to understand opportunities and challenges related to multi- or shared-use spaces particularly for tenure rights. Resolving regulatory and legal constraints will enable high and low tech farms to produce substantially more food in the city",geographic information systems (gis) remote sensing;high-tech urban farming;land use policy;policy analysis;urban agriculture,,"Diehl, J.A.; National University of Singapore Department of Architecture 8 Architecture Drive, #04-03, SDE 4, Singapore; email: akijac@nus.edu.sg",,Elsevier B.V.,22119124,,,,English,Global Food Secur,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85084221909,6,Singapore,Singapore,department of architecture;murdoch university;asia pacific centre for environmental law,department of architecture,activities;adaptation;agricultural use;agriculture;agriculture land;agrifood;agrifood innovation;aims;approaches;attention;challenges;changes;cities;city;city face;citystate;collaboration;commercial land;commercial urban;constraints;critical adaptation;crossagency;crossagency collaboration;describe;development;efficient;emerging policy;example;examples;face;farms;food;food insecurity;food policy;food production;future;future city;global attention;grown;highdensity;hightech;hightech intensification;include;innovation;innovation park;insecurity;integrate;integrative approach;intensification;land;land scarcity;land use;legal constraint;low tech;map;model;model agrifood;multi;multifunctional;multifunctional urban;multiplicity;open space;opportunities;paper;park;policies;policy;policy development;policy support;policy trend;produce;production;promotion;rights;scarcity;separate agriculture;shareduse;shareduse space;shift;singapore;spaces;support;sustainability;tech;tech farm;tenure;tenure right;threats;trends;understand;understand opportunity;undeveloped land;urban agriculture;urban farm;urban food;urban land;urbanising city;use;use multiplicity;uses,agriculture;approach;cities;city singapore;land;land use;planning;singapores;urban agriculture;use;use planning,0

This study was carried out to investigate the effects of temperature, light, salinity and soil moisture at the stage of plant life most sensitive to abiotic stresses (seed germination). The results indicate that light is not a germination requirement, while temperature the main factor that regulates the germination process of this species. Seed germination was inhibited by warm temperatures of 25 and 30 °C. By contrast, intermediate temperatures of 10, 15 and 20 °C induced high germination percentages both in alternating light/darkness and continuous darkness. The alternating temperature of 12/20 °C led to germination percentages close to 100 % and the highest germination speed, making this the suggested optimal for germination. The germination values attained demonstrated the absence of dormancy in H. ericoides seeds. In general, salinity and drought stress (induced by NaCl and PEG solutes, respectively) caused similar effects, reducing and delaying seed germination as the osmotic potential decreased (from 0 to -1.68 MPa). However, while most non-germinated seeds remained viable during exposure to all the osmotic potentials induced by PEG and germinated when drought stress was alleviated, the highest levels of salt stress permanently inhibited germination, although not in all seeds. These results indicated that germination inhibition under both NaCl and PEG stress is mainly due to the low water potential caused by osmotic stress, while salt stress had the added toxic effect of specific ions at the highest concentrations of NaCl. So, H. ericoides seeds can germinate well under conditions of moderate salinity and high drought stress, making it a promising species for use in sustainable urban gardening, with a low input of irrigation water of low quality",abiotic stresses;germination recovery;ornamental species;osmotic potential;seed ecology;urban gardening,abiotic factor;drought stress;germination;induced response;inhibition;light effect;mediterranean environment;ornamental species;salinity;seed production;temperature effect;wild population;hypericum ericoides,"Vicente, M.J.; Departamento de Produccion Vegetal, Instituto de Biotecnologia Vegetal, Universidad Politecnica de Cartagena, Paseo Alfonso XIII, 48, Spain; email: maria.vicente@upct.es",,Elsevier B.V.,03044238,,SHRTA,,English,Sci Hortic,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85083709161,6,Spain,Spain,instituto de biotecnologia vegetal,instituto de biotecnologia vegetal,abiotic stress;absence;concentrations;conditions;continuous darkness;contrast;darkness;dormancy;drought;drought stress;effect;effects;environment;ericoides;exposure;factor;gardening;germinate;germinate well;germination;germination inhibition;germination percentage;germination process;germination requirement;germination speed;germination value;h;high drought;high germination;hypericum;hypericum ericoides;indicate;inhibition;input;intermediate;intermediate temperature;investigate;ions;irrigation;irrigation water;levels;life;light;lightdarkness;low input;low quality;low water;main factor;mediterranean;mediterranean urban;moderate;moderate salinity;moisture;mpa;nacl;ornamental;ornamental use;osmotic potential;osmotic stress;peg;peg stress;percentage close;percentages;plant;plant life;potential ornamental;potentials;process;promising;quality;regulates;requirement;result indicate;results;rock;rock plant;salinity;salt;salt stress;seed;seed germination;seeds;similar effect;soil;soil moisture;solutes;species;specific ion;speed;stage;stress;stress seed;stresses;study;sustainable gardening;temperature;temperatures;toxic;toxic effect;urban environment;urban gardening;use;values;warm;warm temperature;water;water potential;°c,drought;drought stress;effect;ericoides;germination;hypericum;hypericum ericoides;light;ornamental;ornamental potential;plant;salinity;seed;seed germination;stresses;temperature;wild;wild plant,1

These small-scale farms and gardens often use planter boxes and raised beds filled with lightweight soil or potting mixes. While previous studies on biochar focused on its application on large-scale contiguous farmlands, this study aimed to evaluate the suitability of biochar as a partial soil substitute to produce a durable and lightweight soil-biochar mix for small-scale urban farms. The effects of biochar on the chemical properties of the soil-biochar mix, crop yield and, particularly, crop nutrients and metabolic content were assessed. A germination test using pak choi seeds (Brassica rapa L. cultivar group Pak choi, Green-Petioled Form) showed that the biochar contained phytostimulants. Through a nursery pot experiment over four growth cycles, biochar treatments performed better than pure soil at retaining water-soluble NO3 − and K+ ions, but were worse at retaining PO4 3− ions. Nonetheless, despite its positive effect on soil NO3 − retention, biochar application did not improve crop yield significantly when the application rate varied from 0% to 60% (v/v). Untargeted metabolomic analyses showed that biochar application may increase the production of carbohydrates and certain flavonoids and glucosinolates. The results of this study showed that biochar can potentially be used to improve pak choi nutritional values and applied in large quantity to obtain a lightweight soil mix for urban farming",flavonoids;glucosinolates;kaempferol biosynthetic pathway;leafy vegetables;untargeted metabolomics,crops;food supply;metabolism;nutrients;seed;soil testing;soils;application rates;chemical characteristic;its applications;lightweight soils;metabolomic analysis;nutrient contents;nutritional value;urban agricultures;urban growth;biochar;carbohydrate;charcoal;flavonoid;glucosinolate;nitrate;phosphate;potassium;unclassified drug;angiosperm;biochar;crop plant;crop yield;fertilizer application;growth response;leafy vegetable;metabolism;soil chemistry;urban agriculture;agricultural land;article;biomass;biosynthesis;bok choy;carbohydrate analysis;chemical analysis;controlled study;germination;harvest;leafy vegetable;metabolomics;nonhuman;nutrient content;nutritional value;phytotoxicity;plant growth;plant metabolism;priority journal;soil amendment;soil analysis;soil chemistry;urban area;brassica rapa;brassica rapa subsp. chinensis,"Wang, C.-H.; NUS Environmental Research Institute, National University of Singapore, 1 Create Way, Create Tower #15-02, Singapore; email: chewch@nus.edu.sg",,Elsevier B.V.,00489697,,STEVA,,English,Sci Total Environ,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85084035454,15,Singapore;Australia;China;South Korea,Singapore,department of biological sciences;nus environmental research institute;department of chemistry;agri-technology & food innovation department;centre for urban greenery and ecology (research);school of environmental & rural science;korea biochar research center & apru sustainable waste management program & division of environmental science and ecological engineering;school of mechanical engineering;department of chemical and biomolecular engineering,department of biological sciences,analyses;application;application rate;beds;biochar;biochar application;biochar treatment;boxes;brassica;brassica rapa;carbohydrates;certain flavonoid;chemical;chemical property;choi;cities;community;consumption;content;contiguous farmland;crises;crop;crop nutrient;crop yield;cultivar;cultivar group;cycles;effect;effects;evaluate;experiment;farmlands;farms;flavonoids;food;food crisis;food security;form;future;gardens;germination;germination test;glucosinolates;group;group pak;growth;growth cycle;home;home consumption;home garden;increase;ions;k;k ion;l;large quantity;largescale;lightweight;lightweight soil;lightweight soilbiochar;metabolic;metabolic content;metabolomic;metabolomic analysis;mix;mixes;no3;nursery;nursery pot;nutrients;nutritional value;option;pak;pak choi;partial soil;phytostimulants;planter;planter box;po4;positive effect;possible food;pot;pot experiment;presents;previous study;produce;production;promising;promising option;properties;pure;pure soil;quantity;rapa;rapa l;rate;results;retention;security;seed brassica;seeds;smallscale;smallscale community;smallscale farm;soil;soil mix;soil no3;soil substitute;soilbiochar;soilbiochar mix;studies;study;substitute;suitability;test;treatments;untargeted metabolomic;urban farm;urban farming;use;use planter;values;varied;vv;watersoluble no3;yield;−,agriculture;agriculture impact;biochar;brassica;brassica rapa;characteristics;chemical;chemical characteristic;content;cycles;growth;growth cycle;impacts;metabolism;multiple;multiple growth;nutrient;nutrient content;rapa;rapa growth;soil;soil chemical;urban agriculture,3

However, many urban soils are contaminated and pose risks to human health. This study was conducted in a highly publicized urban garden in Brooklyn, NY with elevated Pb and As levels. Our objectives were to: (1) assess the nature and extent of Pb and As contamination at this site; (2) evaluate the effectiveness of amendments on reducing the bioaccessibility and phytoavailability of Pb and As in soil; and (3) assess the potential exposure of children to Pb and As through direct and indirect exposure pathways. Field surveys of the site revealed that contamination was highly concentrated in one area of the garden associated with fruit tree production. Field plots were established in this area, with three different treatments (bone meal, compost, sulfur) and an unamended control. Bioaccessibility of Pb was significantly reduced by all three treatments compared to the control (33%): bone meal (24%), compost (23%), sulfur (24%). In this study, As bioaccessibility remained high (80–93%) with or without treatments. We found that the effectiveness of soil remediation with amendments is variable and often limited, and contaminated sites can still pose a significant risk to urban gardeners.

However, few field studies have measured well-being of urban gardening, particularly during household gardening. Our study develops protocols to measure emotional well-being (EWB) reported during household gardening, comparing it with other leisure and day-to-day activities. We also explore how gardening EWB varies across gardener type (vegetable vs ornamental), demographics, neighborhood type, and companionship during gardening. Using a recently developed app-based Day Reconstruction Method, EWB was measured across 370 participants in the Minneapolis-St. Paul Area, USA, wherein 118 (32%) reported engaging in household gardening. Innovatively, five measures of EWB were computed for each participant for each activity type: average net affect, average happiness, average meaningfulness, the frequency of experiencing peak positive emotions (happiness and meaningfulness). Among all three average EWB measures, gardening is among the top 5 out of 15 activities assessed, and, is not statistically different from biking, walking and eating out. All four of these activities fall behind other leisure/recreation activities, which ranks first. For frequency of experiencing peak happiness, only other leisure/recreation activities were statistically higher than all the remaining (14) activities. Average net affect of gardening was significantly higher for vegetable gardeners (vs ornamental), for low-income gardeners (vs higher income) and for women. Companionship while gardening at home, race/ethnicity and urban versus suburban location showed no significant difference. Livability and equity considerations based on these EWB findings, and their impacts on urban food plans, are discussed",,equity;food;household energy;neighborhood;urban area;vegetable;minneapolis;minnesota;saint paul;united states,"Ramaswami, A.; Princeton University, Civil & Environmental Engineering, 41 Olden St., United States; email: anu.ramaswami@princeton.edu",,Elsevier B.V.,01692046,,LUPLE,,English,Landsc Urban Plann,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85081216882,4,United States,United States,princeton university;university of minnesota - humphrey school of public affairs;department of civil & environmental engineering,princeton university,activities;activity;activity fall;activity type;affect;area;attention;average ewb;average happiness;average meaningfulness;become;bicycling;biking;cities;city seek;companionship;considerations;day;day reconstruction;daytoday;daytoday activity;demographics;developed;develops;difference;emotion happiness;emotional wellbeing;emotions;equity;equity consideration;ewb;ewb measure;ewb varies;explore;fall;field;field study;findings;food;food plan;frequency;gardener;gardener type;gardener v;gardeners;gardening;gardening ewb;gardening household;happiness;home;household;household gardening;impacts;income;leisure;leisurerecreation;leisurerecreation activity;livability;location;lowincome;lowincome gardener;meaningfulness;measure;measures;method;minneapolisst;much attention;neighborhood;neighborhood type;net;net affect;ornamental;participant;participants;paul;paul area;peak;peak happiness;plans;positive emotion;protocols;raceethnicity;ranks;reconstruction;reconstruction method;seek;significant difference;studies;study;study develops;suburban;suburban location;top;type;type average;type vegetable;urban food;urban gardening;urban versus;usa;v ornamental;varies;vegetable;vegetable gardener;vegetable v;versus;versus suburban;vs;wherein;women,assessment;dynamic assessment;gardening;happiness;multiactivity;region;residents;twincities;urban resident;usa,5

Domestic gardens, which are a primary node of contact between city residents and nature, typically represent a significant portion of the urban greenspaces, so the gardeners who manage them play an important role in maintaining the greenspaces within a city. In this way, gardeners voluntarily provide a public service so should be encouraged, but the motivations of individual gardeners have not been sufficiently studied. In this study, we address this research gap by using a 14 item ‘motivations for gardening’ scale to evaluate the motivations for gardening held by gardeners in different cultural contexts. We used questionnaires to collect data in three Swiss cities (Lausanne, Bern and Zurich; N = 409) and one Chilean city (Temuco; N = 167) and analysed the responses at both item and scale levels. Although significant differences between Swiss and Chilean responses were found for all individual scale items, a principal component analysis revealed nearly identical component structures for both the Swiss and Chilean samples. Three clear components were identified; restoration as the motivational component receiving the strongest agreement, followed by socialization, and then food production. Nearly identical component structures were found, with the same scale items loading against the same components, when the sample was divided according to age, gender, education and income. These results suggest that motivations for gardening are not context dependant but rather represent an inherent human condition that frames how gardeners manage and interact with their gardens. Acknowledgement of these human needs: especially regarding the restoration benefits that people gain from these spaces, in public policies related to management and regulation of green urban areas has the potential to contribute to the survival of urban gardens",chile;cross-cultural comparison;gardens;motivations;principal component analysis;procrustes rotation;switzerland,ecosystem service;greenspace;home garden;psychology;public service;questionnaire survey;urban area;urban development;chile;switzerland,"Home, R.; Research Institute of Organic Agriculture FiBL, Ackerstrasse 113, Postfach 219, Switzerland; email: robert.home@fibl.org",,Elsevier GmbH,16188667,,,,English,Urban For Urban Greening,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85084346897,2,Switzerland;Chile,Switzerland,research institute of organic agriculture fibl;universidad de la frontera;center of applied ecology and sustainability (capes),research institute of organic agriculture fibl,acknowledgement;address;age;agreement;analysis;areas;benefits;bern;broad consensus;chilean;chilean city;chilean response;chilean sample;cities;city;city lausanne;city resident;city temuco;clear component;collect;collect data;component;component analysis;component receiving;component structure;components;condition;consensus;contact;context;context dependant;contexts;contribute;cultural context;data;dependant;differences;domestic gardens;ecosystem;ecosystem service;education;evaluate;food;food production;found;frames;gain;gap;gardener manage;gardeners;gardening;gardening’;gardens;gender;green urban;greenspaces;habitats;health;held;human;human condition;human need;identical component;important role;income;individual gardener;individual scale;inherent;inherent human;interact;item;item ‘motivations;items;lausanne;levels;manage;management;motivational;motivational component;motivations;n;nature;needs;node;people;play;policies;portion;primary;primary node;principal;principal component;production;provide;provide habitat;public;public policy;public service;questionnaires;range;regulation;represent;research;research gap;residents;responses;restoration;restoration benefit;result suggest;results;role;sample;samples;scale;scale item;scale level;service;services;significant difference;significant portion;social ecosystem;socialization;spaces;structures;study;suggest;survival;swiss city;temuco;understood;urban area;urban garden;urban greenspaces;way;zurich;‘motivations,chilean;chilean gardener;comparison;crosscultural comparison;gardeners;gardening;motivations;outcomes;psychosocial;psychosocial outcome;urban gardening,6

Urban nature-based solutions, such as greening strategies that foster urban food production as a cross-cutting issue, promise to have multidimensional benefits for sustainable urban development. However, a conceptual understanding of interlinkages between nature-based solutions and their contribution to sustainability transformation is lacking. The goals of this study are twofold. First, to develop a conceptual model for testing multi-dimensional impacts of urban nature-based solutions supporting social-spatial, social-ecological and individual sustainable transformation. The model has been developed based on the concepts of place attachment, human-food connection and pro-environmental food behaviour. Second, the conceptual model is applied to the example of edible cities. Edible cities can be considered an innovative nature-based solution that provides multiple co-benefits by offering (free) food for urban residents in public spaces. A Principal Component Analysis of a survey among residents of Andernach (N = 380), one of the first edible cities in Germany revealed, in contrast to the conceptual three-dimensional model, a four-dimensional model with high construct validity and reliability. The model comprises a) place attachment, b) experiential and c) material human-food connection as well as d) pro-environmental food consumption. Items of internal emotional and philosophical human-food connection included within the pro-environmental food consumption scale suggested their important role in fostering sustainability. Results suggest that the edible city can be considered a strategy for increasing urban attractiveness and place identity, supporting social bonding and experiential human-food connection by using the edible areas for nature observation and recreation. However, although the residents are well informed about the edible city concept, most residents are not actively involved and rarely use the food provided by the edible city. Thus, they also could not answer questions related to cognitive human-food connection such as estimating the food's taste and health quality. To strengthen material and cognitive human-food connection, policy implications of the results propose the implementation of accompanying information and participation activities. By linking nature-based solutions with sustainability transformation, this study provides conceptual and practical implications for the multidimensional benefits of innovative urban greening strategies such as edible cities",human-nature connection;place attachment;pro-environmental food behavior;urban agriculture;urban gardening;urban living quality,agriculture;food supply;philosophical aspects;principal component analysis;public policy;reliability analysis;urban growth;human nature;living quality;place attachment;pro-environmental food behavior;urban agricultures;urban gardening;sustainable development,"Artmann, M.; Leibniz Institute of Ecological Urban and Regional Development, Weberplatz 1, Germany; email: m.artmann@ioer.de",,Elsevier Ltd,09596526,,JCROE,,English,J Clean Prod,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85078665882,3,Germany;Czechia,Germany,leibniz institute of ecological urban and regional development;university of south bohemia in ceske budejovice;jan evangelista purkyne university in usti nad labem,leibniz institute of ecological urban and regional development,activities;analysis;andernach;andernach n;answer;areas;attachment;attractiveness;b;b experiential;become;behaviour;benefits;bonding;c;c material;cities;city;city concept;cobenefits;cognitive;cognitive humanfood;component;component analysis;comprises;concept;concepts;conceptual model;conceptual threedimensional;conceptual understanding;connection;construct;construct validity;consumption;consumption scale;contrast;contribution;contributors;developed;development;edible area;edible city;example;experiential humanfood;food;food behaviour;food consumption;food production;food taste;foods;foster;fourdimensional model;free food;germany;goals;health;health quality;high construct;humanfood;humanfood connection;identity;impacts;implementation;implications;important role;individual sustainable;information;innovative urban;interlinkages;internal emotional;issue;items;major contributor;material;material humanfood;meantime;model;model comprises;multidimensional;multidimensional benefit;multidimensional impact;multiple;multiple cobenefits;n;nature;nature observation;naturebased solution;observation;offering;participation;participation activity;philosophical humanfood;place;place attachment;place identity;policy;policy implication;practical implication;principal;principal component;problems;production;proenvironmental;proenvironmental food;promise;propose;public;public space;quality;questions;recreation;reliability;residents;result propose;result suggest;results;role;scale;seedbeds;social bonding;solution;solutions;spaces;strategies;strategy;strengthen;strengthen material;study;suggest;survey;sustainability;sustainability problem;sustainability transformation;sustainable transformation;taste;threedimensional model;transformation;twofold;urban attractiveness;urban development;urban food;urban greening;urban resident;use;validity,case;case study;cities;conceptual multidimensional;edible city;framework;germany;multidimensional;multidimensional framework;role;study;sustainability;sustainability transformation;transformation;transformation –;–,7

New forms of urban agriculture are observed such as rooftop farming. In the case of low-tech rooftop farming projects, based on recycled urban waste, one of the key issues is the type of substrate used, as it determines the functions and ecosystem services delivered by the green roof. Using a five year experimental trial, we quantified the food production potential of Technosols created only with urban wastes (green waste compost, crushed wood, spent mushroom), as well as the soil fertility and the potential contamination of food products. Regarding food production, our cropping system showed promising results across the five years, in relation with the high fertility of the Technosols. This fertility was maintained, as well as the nutrients stocks after five cropping years. Most of the edible crops had trace metals contents below existing norms for toxic trace metals with nevertheless a concern regarding certain some trace metals such as Zn and Cu. There was no trace metal accumulation in the Technosols over time except for Zn.

We determined how much of the food supply of Sydney, Australia, could be produced through UA by synthesising yield data from 13 UA gardens with information on labour and key material inputs and using spatial analyses to assess available land area. We modelled three scenarios with varying proportions of available land used for food production; 25 %, 50 % or 75 % of domestic yard space along with street verges and unused land (e.g. vacant lots). Around 15 % of Sydney's total food supply, or its entire vegetable supply, could be produced through UA under the low range scenario, increasing to 34 % under the highest land use scenario. Under the low range scenario, all necessary irrigation water and organic soil amendments could be obtained from local waste streams, though these sources were insufficient to meet the needs of higher range scenarios. Available labour was a limiting factor in all scenarios, with the entire population being insufficient to meet labour needs required to maintain food production under efficiency and labour investment regimes typical of amateur urban gardeners. Establishing a professionalised UA workforce with greater labour efficiency would be required for managing the available land, however this scenario would likely require changes in public attitudes towards use of private land. These social issues, rather than physical limitations, may be the biggest factors preventing cities like Sydney from obtaining a non-trivial proportion of their food supply from UA",economics;food production;food security;productivity;spatial analysis;sustainability;urban farming,crop production;food production;food supply;spatial analysis;sustainability;urban agriculture;urban economy;australia;new south wales;sydney [new south wales],"Mcdougall, R.; School of Environmental and Rural Sciences, University of New EnglandAustralia; email: robert.n.mcdougall@gmail.com",,Elsevier Ltd,02648377,,,,English,Land Use Policy,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85080872257,3,Australia,Australia,school of environmental and rural sciences,school of environmental and rural sciences,agriculture;agriculture ua;amateur;amateur urban;amendments;analyses;area;assess;attitude towards;attitudes;australia;available labour;available land;changes;cities;data;domestic yard;e;efficiency;entire population;entire vegetable;factor;factors;food;food production;food supply;g;gardeners;gardens;high input;information;input;input requirement;inputs;insufficient;investment;investment regime;irrigation;irrigation water;issues;key;key material;labour;labour efficiency;land;land area;land e;land use;likely require;limitations;local waste;lots;low range;maintain;maintain food;material;material input;meet;necessary irrigation;needs;nontrivial proportion;organic soil;physical limitation;population;private land;production;productivity;proportion;proportions;public;public attitude;range;range scenario;regimes;require;require change;requirements;scenario;scenarios;social issue;soil;soil amendment;sources;space;spatial analysis;streams;street;street verge;supply;sydney;sydney total;sydneys;terms;total food;towards;ua;ua garden;ua workforce;unit;unit area;unused land;urban agriculture;urban gardener;use;use scenario;vacant;vacant lots;vegetable;vegetable supply;verges;waste;waste stream;water;workforce;yard;yield;yield data,agriculture;australia;food;food supply;land;land use;provide;scenarios;supply;sydney;urban agriculture;use;use scenario,9

The crystallization, elemental composition and oxidation states present in the BLN:Mn4+ nanophosphors are confirmed by the X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses. The photoluminescence spectra reveal a promising red emission band at 685 nm wavelength region under both 351 and 510 nm excitations, which is the required far-red emission for phototropism in plants. Furthermore, the optimized BLN:0.25Mn4+ nanophosphors exhibited all the features required for three levels of latent fingerprint detection on various nonporous surfaces under 365 nm illumination. The fluctuation of the red value on pixel profile confirms the good affinity of BLN:0.25Mn4+ nanophosphors with the fingerprint ridges. Because of their excellent luminescent properties and brilliant performance in the latent fingerprint detection process, the synthesized BLN:Mn4+ nanophosphors can be considered as a promising fluorescent material for the fabrication of plant growth LEDs and latent fingerprint applications",far-red emission;latent fingerprints;nanorod-like particles;plant growth leds;sol-gel technique,barium compounds;boron compounds;fluorescence;forensic science;lanthanum compounds;light emitting diodes;manganese compounds;nanorods;niobium compounds;optical properties;palmprint recognition;photoluminescence;sol-gel process;sol-gels;x ray photoelectron spectroscopy;elemental compositions;fluorescent materials;latent fingerprint;narrow emission bands;photoluminescence spectrum;plant growth;red emissions;sol-gel technique;nitrogen compounds,"Han, Y.-K.; Department of Energy and Materials Engineering, Dongguk University-SeoulSouth Korea; email: ykenergy@dongguk.edu",,Elsevier Ltd,02728842,,CINND,,English,Ceram Int,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85077575102,8,India;South Korea,South Korea,department of biological engineering;department of energy and materials engineering;department of electrical;department of electronic engineering;department of physics,department of biological engineering,affinity;analyses;applicability;applications;ba2lanbo6;ba2lanbo6 blnmn4;band;bands;bln0;blnmn4;blnmn4 nanophosphors;brilliant;brilliant performance;citric;composition;confirms;crystallization;detection;detection process;diffraction;diodes;doped;elemental;elemental composition;emission;emission band;excellent;excellent luminescent;excitations;fabrication;facile;facile citric;features;fields;fingerprint;fingerprint application;fingerprint detection;fingerprint ridge;fluctuation;fluorescent;fluorescent material;fluorescent nanomaterials;forensic science;good affinity;growth;herein;illumination;ions;latent;latent fingerprint;leds;levels;luminescent;luminescent property;material;mn4;mn4 ion;morphology;nanomaterials;nanophosphors;nanorodlike;narrow;narrow emission;nm;nm wavelength;nonporous surface;novel;novel fluorescent;optical property;oxidation;oxidation state;performance;photoelectron;photoelectron spectroscopy;photoluminescence;photoluminescence spectrum;phototropism;pixel;pixel profile;plant;plant growth;plants;present;process;profile;profile confirms;promising;properties;red emission;red value;region;report;reveal;ridges;route;science;solgel;spectra;spectroscopy;spectroscopy analysis;spectrum reveal;state present;states;surfaces;unique;urban farming;value;various field;wavelength;wavelength region;xray;xray diffraction;xray photoelectron,applications;ba2lanbo6mn4;ba2lanbo6mn4 nanophosphor;detection;efficient;fingerprint;fingerprint detection;forensic latent;horticulture;latent;latent fingerprint;nanophosphor,10

More than eighty people formed an aquaponics community. The community has conducted routine training on aquaponics to develop urban farming through this system. But the number of aquaponics was unstable. Therefore, the purpose of this research was to find out the motives and dynamics of the aquaponics community in supporting urban farming. The method of this research used a qualitative approach. The results of studies with the analysis of the theory of motives and group dynamics show that this community was in the class of altruism and collectivism motivation so that it has a chance of sustainability even though at certain moments it decreases. As for the dynamics of some actors who think that they weren't in line with expectation, factors emerge that weaken the community in aquaponic. However, those who have altruism and collectivism motives will tend to survive because they got personal satisfaction and a good impact on their environment. Therefore, when many actors leave this system, they keep trying to return to carry out aquaponic activities in support of urban farming in Semarang",,dynamics;aquaponic;community-based;group dynamics;qualitative approach;sustainable development,,,Institute of Physics Publishing,17551307,,,,English,IOP Conf Ser Earth Environ Sci,Conference Paper,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85083198801,2,Indonesia,Indonesia,department of urban and regional planning,department of urban and regional planning,activities;actors;altruism;analysis;approach;aquaponic;aquaponic activity;aquaponics;carry;certain moment;chance;class;collectivism;collectivism motif;collectivism motivation;community;decreases;dynamic show;dynamics;eighty;eighty people;emerge;environment;expectation;factor emerge;factors;good impact;group;impact;line;many actor;method;moments;motivation;motives;number;people;personal satisfaction;purpose;qualitative;qualitative approach;research;results;return;routine;routine training;satisfaction;semarang;show;studies;support;survive;sustainability;system;tend;theory;think;training;urban farming;weaken;werent,aquaponics;motives;semarang;urban farming,12

In particular, the research explores the key role played by some politically progressive forms of urban gardening in pivoting actions that transform green spaces through informal planning into areas for food production and collaborative management. This challenges traditional governance networks and re-defines the functioning of public spaces. The case of Parco delle Energie in Rome (Italy) serves as an example of a process of space re-appropriation, planning and finally co-management performed by a dense network of very diverse actors, who established a collaborative framework with the administration in order to re-shape decision-making dynamics. A comparative analysis of international cases confirms that urban gardening is challenging the dominance of a traditional planning perspective worldwide, both spatially as on the level of governance, and is turning citizens’ dissensus into a productive force in the re-imagination and stewardship of public urban space. The conclusion suggests the self-design and co-managing capacities of urban gardeners and citizens could lead to adequate synergies between actors, enabling new urban governance models in line with the global ambition to build more sustainable and inclusive cities",governance;informality;land use;planning;public space;urban gardening,decision making;design;food production;governance approach;greenspace;informal sector;land use planning;planning practice;public administration;public space;urban area;italy;lazio;roma [lazio];rome,"Certoma, C.; Ghent UniversityBelgium; email: Chiara.Certoma@UGent.be",,SAGE Publications Ltd,00420980,,,,English,Urban Stud,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85062663437,3,Spain;Belgium,Belgium,ghent university;universitat internacional de catalunya;KU Leuven,ghent university,actions;actors;adequate;adequate synergy;administration;ambition;analysis;areas;build;capacities;case;case confirms;cases;challenges;characterise;cities;citizens;citizens’;citizens’ dissensus;cocreative;cocreative form;collaborative;collaborative framework;collaborative management;comanagement;comparative;comparative analysis;conclusion;conclusion suggests;confirms;delle;delle energie;dense;dense network;described;dissensus;diverse;diverse actor;dominance;dynamics;emergence;energie;example;explores;food;food production;force;forms;framework;gardeners;gardening;geometries;global ambition;governance;governance model;governance network;governance’;green space;inclusive city;informal planning;international case;investigates;italy;italy serf;key;key role;lead;leads;level;line;management;models;network;networks;new geometry;order;paper;paper investigates;parco;parco delle;perspective;perspective worldwide;planning;planning practice;played;power;practices;process;production;productive force;progressive;progressive form;public;public space;public urban;reappropriation;redefines;reimagination;relationship;research;research explores;reshape;responsibility;role;rome;rome italy;selfdesign;serves;space;space governance;space reappropriation;spaces;stewardship;suggests;synergies;traditional governance;traditional planning;transform;transform green;urban gardener;urban gardening;urban governance;urban space;worldwide;‘fluid;‘fluid governance’,governance’;informal planning;insights;planning;planning practice;practices;public;public space;rome;spaces;‘fluid;‘fluid governance’,13

Recent studies have demonstrated that a better understanding of carbon dynamics can be achieved by considering different carbon pools. Here we used a simple method of physical SOC fractionation to assess the impact of market gardening practices on the evolution of total SOC and its stable and labile sub-fractions over a period of several decades. The study was conducted at the Kuinima market gardening zone in Bobo-Dioulasso (Burkina Faso). Composite soil samples (0–15 cm depth) were collected from a chronosequence of 69 fields including control plots and plots farmed for more than 50 years. Samples were wet sieved at 20 µm after agitation or sonication to assess carbon content in the fine (i.e. stable) and coarse fractions. Our results show an asymptotic increase in total carbon content, from 9 g C kg−1 for uncultivated control plots to 28 g C kg−1 for plots cultivated for more than 50 years. This increase tends to stabilize after 30 years. A similar trend is observed for C content in the coarse fraction &gt; 20 µm. In contrast, carbon content in the fraction &lt; 20 µm increased linearly over time, and this increase was greater in sonicated than in agitated samples. Based on the comparison of the two fractionation methods, a strong contribution of micro-aggregation to the physical stabilization of SOC was hypothesized. This stabilization appears favored by short-range-order (SRO) iron and aluminum oxides and/or metal-humus complexes, as suggested by the strong correlation between stable C content and oxalate-extractable Fe and Al. Large and repeated additions of organic amendments in market gardening thus appear to lead to increased SOC content and promote SOC storage in the stable fraction, thereby contributing to soil quality improvement and the mitigation of climate change",carbon fractionation;market gardening;soil organic carbon;west africa,aluminum oxide;climate change;commerce;iron oxides;soils;stabilization;fractionation methods;metal humus complexes;organic amendments;short-range order;soil organic carbon;strong correlation;sub-saharan africa;west africa;organic carbon;chronosequence;depth determination;fractionation;greenspace;soil carbon;soil chemistry;soil organic matter;soil quality;soil stabilization;urban area;bobo dioulasso;burkina faso;joturus pichardi,"Ouedraogo, R.A.; Earth and Life Institute, Universite catholique de LouvainBelgium; email: delaoued@hotmail.fr",,Elsevier B.V.,00167061,,GEDMA,,English,Geoderma,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85076784802,7,Burkina Faso;Belgium,Belgium,earth and life institute;institut de recherche en sciences appliquees et technologies/direction regional de l'ouest,earth and life institute,additions;africa;agitation;al;aluminum;aluminum oxide;amendments;andor;andor metalhumus;ass carbon;assess;asymptotic increase;bobodioulasso;bobodioulasso burkina;burkina;burkina faso;c;c content;carbon;carbon content;carbon dynamic;carbon pool;carbon soc;change;chronosequence;climate;climate change;cm;cm depth;coarse;coarse fraction;comparison;complexes;composite soil;content;contrast;contribution;control;control plot;correlation;decades;depth;different carbon;dynamics;e;evolution;faso;fe;field;fields;fine;fraction;fraction gt;fraction lt;fractionation;fractionation method;fractions;g;g c;gardening;gardening practice;gardening relies;gt;impact;improvement;increase;increase tends;intensive use;iron;kg−1;kuinima;kuinima market;labile;labile subfractions;lead;lt;market;market gardening;metalhumus;metalhumus complex;method;methods;microaggregation;mitigation;organic amendment;organic carbon;oxalateextractable fe;oxides;period;physical soc;physical stabilization;plots;pools;practices;promote;promote soc;quality;quality improvement;recent study;relies;result show;results;samples;several decade;shortrangeorder;shortrangeorder sro;show;similar trend;simple;simple method;soc;soc content;soc dynamic;soc fractionation;soc storage;soil;soil organic;soil quality;soil sample;sonication;sro;sro iron;stabilization;stable c;stable fraction;storage;strong contribution;strong correlation;studies;study;subfractions;subsaharan;subsaharan africa;tends;time;total carbon;total soc;trend;uncultivated control;use;wet;year;years;zone;µm,burkina;burkina faso;carbon;carbon fraction;faso;fractions;gardening;impact;lixisols;longterm;longterm impact;organic carbon;soil;soil organic;urban gardening,16

Nature-based solutions (NbS) can provide actions for such challenges and strive for maximizing environmental, social and economic benefits. Edible cities, which encompass different forms of urban food production (UFP) in the city, can be seen as multifunctional NbS. However, the concept of edible cities has just recently arrived in research and its understanding as potential NbS supporting UST is still fragmented. Therefore, the study created an analytical framework, which aims at identifying and prioritizing 1) challenges that edible cities can contribute in the context of UST and 2) strategies for implementing and mainstreaming the edible city in the context of urban sustainability acceleration. The study is of explorative character and encompasses interviews with key actors from three German case studies: Andernach – a German frontrunner in implementing the edible city, Haar – follower I, which implemented the concept after learning from Andernach and Munich – follower II, where the concept of edible cities was not yet implemented but a range of bottom-up activities exist to promote the topic. Results show that edible cities can be seen as NbS that can support UST in terms of social-spatial and socio-ecological transformation, in particular promoting social cohesion and human-nature and food connection. In terms of implementing and mainstreaming, the results suggest that the edible city can be taken up by different city departments due to its multifunctionality. Furthermore, a mix of motivated bottom-up initiatives and top-down authorities paired with courage and room for experimentation on the edible city is crucial for its embedding. Apart from that, network creation with different UFP initiatives as well as with other cities is an important factor for mainstreaming edible cities. Future research shall test the transferability of the analytical framework to other NbS analyzing their potential to contribute to UST",human-nature connection;mainstreaming;urban agriculture;urban gardening;urban transformation,analytical framework;bottom-up approach;food production;garden;nature-society relations;sustainable development;urban agriculture;urban development;urban ecosystem;bavaria;germany;munich,"Sartison, K.; Leibniz Institute of Ecological Urban and Regional Development, Weberplatz 1, Germany; email: k.sartison@ioer.de",,Elsevier GmbH,16188667,,,,English,Urban For Urban Greening,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85078427590,2,Germany,Germany,leibniz institute of ecological urban and regional development,leibniz institute of ecological urban and regional development,acceleration;actions;activities;actors;aims;analytical framework;andernach;andernach –;authorities;benefits;bottomup;bottomup activity;bottomup initiative;case;case study;challenge;challenges;character;cities;city;city department;cohesion;concept;connection;context;contribute;courage;creation;departments;different city;different form;different societal;different ufp;economic benefit;edible cities;edible city;encompass;encompasses;exist;experimentation;explorative character;factor;follower;follower ii;food;food connection;food production;forms;framework;frontrunner;future;future research;german case;german frontrunner;haar;haar –;humannature;ii;important factor;initiatives;interviews;key;key actor;mix;multifunctional;multifunctional nb;multifunctionality;munich;munich –;naturebased solution;nbs;network;network creation;particular promoting;potential nb;prioritizing challenge;production;production ufp;promote;provide;range;research;result show;result suggest;results;room;show;social cohesion;societal;societal challenge;socioecological transformation;solution nb;solutions;strategies;strategy;strive;studies;study;study andernach;suggest;support;support ust;sustainability;sustainability acceleration;sustainability transformation;terms;test;topdown;topdown authority;topic;transferability;transformation;transformation ust;ufp;ufp initiative;urban food;urban sustainability;ust;–;– follower,cities;city –;edible city;explorative study;food;food production;german city;naturebased solution;production;solution;study;sustainability;sustainability transformation;transformation;urban food;urban sustainability;–,20

In this study, the growth and glucosinolate (GSL) profiles of a common Asian vegetable, Brassica rapa subsp. chinensis var. parachinensis (choy sum or cai xin) were determined under LED lighting. The growth of choy sum was influenced by both the LED light intensity and spectrum, with plants grown under 160 μmol m−2 s−1 red-blue light (160RB) producing the highest shoot biomass (∼100–300 % increment in adult plants). GSL content was found to vary across growth stages regardless of LED treatment. Total GSLs per gram fresh weight were four times higher in one-leafed seedlings than in adult plants. A shift from a high proportion of aliphatic GSLs in one-leafed seedlings to indolic and aromatic GSLs in three-leafed seedlings and adult plants was attributed to an increase in the proportion of glucobrassicin and/or 4-hydroxy-glucobrassicin, and gluconasturtiin which are known to have anti-cancer properties.

Simultaneously, with urbanization rapidly expanding in Asia, S. invicta impacts on the socio-economic benefits of urban farming are to this point unknown. Our study focuses on establishing a baseline on the geographic distribution of the S. invicta spread in Hong Kong urban agroecosystems and its potential impacts on native ant communities and farmers through a series of field surveys and interviews. Our results show that in 15 years, S. invicta has invaded half of the Hong Kong urban agroecosystems, with infestation levels slightly varying in farming practices (organic vs. traditional) but greatly among the different types of cultures. Ecologically, the presence of S. invicta and its increased abundance were associated with a decrease in ant community species richness and evenness. Economically, the farmers’ perception indicated that S. invicta could have impacts on crops production ranging from 10% to 80%, as well as important public health issues associated to indirect economic costs due to the aggressive stinging and consequences on other educational activities. Finally, all control methods used were mainly inefficient and maladjusted to these environments.

As such, we explore the conceptual gaps opened up in-between everyday lifestyle politics, green social movements and critiques of neoliberal urban political economies, by leveraging a novel and fine-grained conceptualization of civic and place-based material participation built from pragmatic sociology. The work of Laurent Thevenot on regimes of engagement, in particular, allow us to trace translations in-between the familiar attachments and the public critiques undertaken by urban green communities in ways that expand the frame on socio-material politics relative to current research conversations. Empirically, we leverage this re-conceptualization as part of a comprehensive digital mapping exercise set in Denmark, in which we trace core patterns and differences in modes of urban-green politics at the level of everyday citizen practices and group interaction styles across a diversity of urban green communities. Having identified six such civic modes of urban greening and specified their group styles of engagement, we end by discussing the implications of our findings for questions of care, justice and democracy in sustainable city-making",civic environmentalism;engagement regimes;group styles;material politics;place attachment;urban greening,environmentalism;local participation;political economy;sense of place;sustainability;urban planning;urban politics;denmark,"Blok, A.; Department of Sociology, University of Copenhagen, Oester Farimagsgade 5, Denmark; email: abl@soc.ku.dk",,Routledge,13549839,,,,English,Local Environ,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85078609967,2,Denmark,Denmark,department of sociology,department of sociology,article;attachments;beekeeping;biodiversity;biodiversity enhancement;built;care;citizen;citizen practice;civic;civic engagement;civic mode;collectives;communities;communities”–in;comprehensive;comprehensive digital;conceptual gap;conceptualization;conversations;core;core pattern;critique undertaken;critiques;current research;democracy;denmark;deploy;differences;digital;digital mapping;diversity;economies;end;engagement;enhancement;everyday;everyday citizen;everyday lifestyle;exercise;exercise set;expand;explore;familiar attachment;findings;food;food collectives;frame;gaps;gardening;green communities”–in;green community;greening–in;greening–in order;group;group interaction;group practice;group style;implications;inbetween;inbetween everyday;interaction;interaction style;justice;laurent;laurent thevenot;level;leverage;lifestyle;lifestyle politics;mapping;mapping exercise;material;material participation;modes;movements;neoliberal urban;novel;order;part;participation;patterns;phenomenon;political economy;politics;practice towards;practices;pragmatic sociology;probe;public;public critique;questions;reconceptualization;regimes;relative;research;research conversation;set;shape;social movement;sociology;sociomaterial politics;styles;sustainability;sustainability politics;sustainable citymaking;thevenot;towards;trace;trace core;trace translation;translation inbetween;translations;tree;urban gardening;urban greening;urban greening–in;urban sustainability;urbangreen politics;variations;ways;wide variation;work;“urban;“urban green,city;city urban;civic;civic mode;critique;engagement;familiar engagement;green critique;inbetween;modes;nature inbetween;natures;urban nature,23

Therefore, a new solution for modern agriculture is needed to overcome this problem. Technology is useful for modern agriculture, such as the use of IoT for hydroponic farming systems. By using IoT with a smart controlling system, the hydroponic agriculture becomes easier. With the use of IoT in this research, nutrition, pH management, and temperature can be controlled easily. This research also uses fuzzy logic to make the decision making in the control system more efficient and precise. The results of experiments with bok choy and lettuce indicate that the system automatically measures the nutritional value and pH according to the time specified. Then, the system will immediately adjust the value of nutrient content and pH within the specified range.

This paper develops a critical perspective on both common portrayals. It does so by drawing on critical urban theory, especially Lefebvre's Right to the City. First, inspired by Lefebvre's critique of city-centrism, the paper argues that the scope and limits of urban environmentalism hinge not only on the goals pursued but also on how the urban is framed. Urban environmentalism may mean mere lifeworld environmentalism: the greening of cities as if there were (relatively) bounded sites. Yet urban environmentalism may also mean planetary environmentalism: the mapping, problematization, and transformation of unsustainable urbanization processes that underpin given sites and lifeworlds, but also operate at beyond the latter-at a societal and planetary scale. Second, inspired by Lefebvre's reformulation of right claims as a transformative political tool, this paper takes issue with environmental practices and discourses that present society's niches, cracks, and margins as a key fermenting ground for radical environmental change. Since not only institutional but also bottom-up pursuits of more sustainable nature-society relations often remain stuck in mere lifeworld reform, this paper foregrounds heterodox right claims as an underexplored modus operandi in active pursuits of and discourses on radical environmental change. Heterodox right claims mean the active appropriation of dominant political languages, such as the language of right, while seeking to change the latter's grammar. What this may mean in the realm of environmental politics, will be spelled out at hand of the example of claims to a right to public transport",grassroots practices;heterodox right claims;lifeworld environmentalism;planetary environmentalism;the right to public transport;the right to the city;urban environmental politics;urban theory,,"Haderer, M.; Institute for Social Change and Sustainability (IGN), Department of Socioeconomics, WU Vienna, Welthandelsplatz 2, Austria; email: margaret.haderer@wu.ac.at",,MDPI AG,20760760,,,,English,Soc Sci,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85082180243,1,Austria,Austria,institute for social change and sustainability (ign),institute for social change and sustainability (ign),active appropriation;active pursuit;appropriation;argues;bottomup;bottomup pursuit;cafes;change;cities;city;citycentrism;claim mean;claims;common portrayal;coops;cracks;critical perspective;critical urban;critique;develops;discourses;dominant;drivers;environmental change;environmental politics;environmental practice;environmentalism;environmentalism hinge;example;food;food coop;foreground heterodox;foregrounds;gardening;gardening initiative;goals;grammar;grassroots;ground;hand;heterodox;heterodox right;hinge;initiatives;issue;key;key driver;key fermenting;key site;language;languages;latter grammar;latterat;latters;lefebvres;libraries;lifeworld;lifeworld environmentalism;lifeworld reform;lifeworlds;limits;literature;mapping;margins;mean;mean planetary;mere lifeworld;modus;modus operandi;naturesociety;naturesociety relation;niches;operandi;operate;paper;paper argues;paper develops;paper foreground;perspective;planetary environmentalism;planetary scale;political language;political tool;politics;portrayals;portrayed;practices;present;present society;problematization;processes;public;public transport;pursuits;realm;reform;reformulation;relations;remain;repair;repair cafes;right;right claim;scale;scope;shift;shift key;shift towards;shifts;sites;societal;society niche;societys;stuck;sustainability;sustainable naturesociety;theory;things;tool;towards;transformation;transformative;transport;underexplored modus;underpin;unsustainable urbanization;urban environmentalism;urban gardening;urban grassroots;urban theory;urbanization;urbanization process,city;environmentalism;lifeworld;lifeworld environmentalism;planetary environmentalism;right;urban environmentalism,25

Where these organisations are forced to compete for survival at the expense of collaboration, their ability to collectively upscale and expand beneficial activities can be compromised. This paper focuses on a lottery-funded UA project and draws predominantly on observations and interviews held with project staff and growing group volunteers. Research conducted in Wythenshawe, Manchester (UK), highlights difficulties experienced by organisations attempting to function in an environment disfigured by depletion, illustrating conflicts that can arise between community groups and charitable organisations competing for space and resources. Inter-organisational dynamics are considered at two scales: at the grassroots level between growing groups, and at a structural level between project partners. In a landscape scarred by local authority cutbacks and restructures, a dearth of funding opportunities and increasingly precarious employment, external initiatives can be met with suspicion or hostility, particularly when viewed as superfluous interventions.

However, lack of available land in cities and a need for rapid crop cycling, to yield quickly and continuously, mean that so far only lettuce and related ‘leafy green’ vegetables are cultivated in urban farms5. New fruit varieties with architectures and yields suitable for urban farming have proven difficult to breed1,5. We identified a regulator of tomato stem length (SlER) and devised a trait-stacking strategy to combine mutations for condensed shoots, rapid flowering (SP5G) and precocious growth termination (SP). Application of our strategy using one-step CRISPR–Cas9 genome editing restructured vine-like tomato plants into compact, early yielding plants suitable for urban agriculture. Field data confirmed that yields were maintained, and we demonstrated cultivation in indoor farming systems. Targeting the same stem length regulator alone in groundcherry, another Solanaceae plant, also enabled engineering to a compact stature.

The current ways of managing waste, such as refuse collection and recycling, are failing to minimise waste in cities. With urban populations growing worldwide, there is the challenge of increased pressure to import food from rural areas. Urban agriculture not only presents an opportunity to explore other means of sustainable food production, but for managing organic waste in cities. However, this opportunity is not taken advantage of. Besides, there is a challenge of mixed reactions from urban planners and policymakers concerning the challenges and benefits presented by using organic waste in urban agriculture. The current paper explores the perceived challenges and opportunities for organic waste utilisation and management through urban agriculture in the Durban South Basin in eThekwini Municipality in KwaZulu‐Natal (KZN) Province of South Africa. It is anticipated that this information will be of use to the eThekwini Municipality, policymakers, researchers, urban agriculture initiatives, households and relevant stakeholders in the study areas and similar contexts globally. Two hundred (200) households involved in any urban farming activity and ten (10) key informants (six (6) staff from the Cleaning and Solid Waste Unit of the eThekwini Municipality and four (4) from the urban agricultural initiative) were selected using convenient sampling. Descriptive statistics and inductive thematic analysis were used to analyse data. The significant perceived challenges and risks associated with the utilisation of organic waste through urban agriculture included lack of a supporting policy, climatic variation, lack of land tenure rights, soil contamination and food safety concerns. Qualitative data further showed that the difficulty in segregating waste, water scarcity, difficulty in accessing inputs, limited transportation of organic waste, inadequate handling and treatment of organic waste, and being a health hazard were some important challenges. On the other hand, the significant perceived benefits associated with the utilisation of organic waste through urban agriculture were enhanced food and nutrition security, and opportunities for business incubation. Other important benefits established through qualitative data were an improved market expansion for farmers and improved productivity. Overall, despite the perceived challenges and risks, there is an opportunity to manage organic waste through urban agriculture. It is imperative for an integrated policy encompassing the food, climate and waste management to be developed to support this strategy. All stakeholders—the government, municipal authorities and urban agricultural initiatives should also, guided by the policy, support urban farmers, for example, through pieces of training on how to properly manage and recycle organic waste, land distribution, inputs availability and water usage rights among other things",composting;ethekwini municipality;recycling of solid waste;sustainable agriculture,alternative agriculture;composting;organic pollutant;perception;policy making;pollution policy;recycling;urban pollution;adult;article;climate change;controlled study;demography;environmental policy;female;food safety;government;household;human;land use;male;middle aged;nutrition;organic waste;qualitative research;risk factor;soil pollution;south africa;sustainable agriculture;urban area;waste management;water management;water scarcity;young adult;durban basin;ethekwini;indian ocean;kwazulu-natal;south africa,"Sibanda, M.; Department of Agriculture, Faculty of Science & Agriculture, University of ZululandSouth Africa; email: SibandaM@unizulu.ac.za",,MDPI AG,16617827,,,32059567.0,English,Int J Environ Res Public Health,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85079513525,3,South Africa,South Africa,department of agriculture;department of geography,department of agriculture,activity;advantage;africa;agricultural initiative;agriculture;agriculture initiative;analyse;analyse data;analysis;areas;authorities;availability;basin;become;benefits;business;business incubation;challenge;challenges;cities;cleaning;climate;climatic variation;collection;concerns;contamination;contexts;convenient;current paper;current way;data;descriptive;descriptive statistic;developed;difficulty;distribution;durban;durban south;ethekwini;ethekwini municipality;example;expansion;explore;explores;farmers;farming activity;food;food production;food safety;government;growth;hand;hazard;health;health hazard;household;households;imperative;import;import food;important benefit;important challenge;inadequate;inadequate handling;increased pressure;incubation;inductive thematic;informants;information;initiative;initiatives;input availability;inputs;integrated policy;key;key informant;kwazulu‐natal;kwazulu‐natal kzn;kzn;kzn province;lack;land;land distribution;land tenure;limited transportation;manage;manage organic;management;market;market expansion;means;minimise;minimise waste;mixed reaction;municipal authority;municipality;nutrition;nutrition security;opportunities;opportunity;organic waste;paper;paper explores;pertinent;pieces;planners;policy;policymakers;population;population growth;populations;presents;pressure;production;productivity;province;qualitative;qualitative data;rapid population;reactions;recycle;recycle organic;refuse;refuse collection;regions;relevant;relevant stakeholder;researchers;rights;risks;rural area;safety;safety concern;scarcity;security;similar context;soil;soil contamination;solid waste;south;south africa;south basin;staff;stakeholders;stakeholders—the;stakeholders—the government;statistics;strategy;study;study area;support;support urban;supporting policy;sustainable food;ten;tenure;tenure right;thematic analysis;things;training;transportation;treatment;unit;urban agriculture;urban farmer;urban farming;urban planner;urban population;urban region;usage;usage right;use;utilisation;variation;waste;waste management;waste unit;waste utilisation;water;water scarcity;water usage;ways;worldwide,agriculture;basin;challenges;durban;durban south;opportunities;organic waste;perceptions;south;south basin;urban agriculture;waste,28

I interrogate the subject of digital urban agriculture with data from 82 semistructured interviews and notes taken during public forms and tours of facilities. Respondents were located in Denver (CO; n = 30), New York (NY; n = 26), and San Francisco (CA; n = 26) and held positions ranging from community organizers, investors, local food powerbrokers, and planners to engineers involved in facilitating urban foodways based on vertical farming, automation, and related technologies. I find digital platforms—systems exhibiting characteristics including real-time surveillance, artificial intelligence, and automation—share similarities with traditional urban farming systems. Both platforms have the potential to disrupt dominant political economies and also have links to gentrification and other inequitable land use patterns. Potential divergences include differences in a) social, cultural, economic, human, and built capital barriers and outcomes; b) land use life course; and c) zoning. Takeaway for practice: Digital urban farming systems inhabit a regulatory gray area; respondents encountered agricultural, industrial, or commercial zoning permits. The “digital” aspects of these systems contributed to this ambiguity and are used by powerbrokers to obtain further zoning permission than is possible with traditional urban agriculture. Compared with more traditional urban farming systems, digital urban agriculture taps into different forms of human capital. Finally, my findings are inconclusive on the issue of land use life course. Some data indicate digital farms will remain in urban cores, whereas other evidence points to the eventual migration of these platforms to the metropolitan periphery",digital agriculture;equity;food justice;food systems planning;vertical farming,equity;farming system;gentrification;human capital;metropolitan area;urban agriculture;urban development;urban planning;colorado;denver;united states,"Carolan, M.; Colorado State UniversityUnited States; email: michael.carolan@colostate.edu",,Routledge,01944363,,,,English,J Am Plann Assoc,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85075922292,1,United States,United States,colorado state university,colorado state university,agriculture;agriculture converge;agriculture tap;ambiguity;area;artificial intelligence;aspects;automation;automation—share;automation—share similarity;b;b land;barriers;built;c;capital;capital barrier;characteristics;co;commercial zoning;community;community organizer;converge;cores;course;data;denver;differences;different form;digital;digital farm;digital platforms—systems;digital urban;disrupt;diverge;divergences;dominant;economies;engineers;eventual migration;evidence;evidence point;facilities;farms;findings;food;food powerbroker;foodways;forms;francisco;gentrification;gray;gray area;held;human;human capital;include;include difference;indicate;indicate digital;inequitable land;inhabit;intelligence;interrogate;interviews;investors;issue;land;land use;life;life course;links;local food;metropolitan;metropolitan periphery;migration;n;new york;newer;notes;ny;organizers;outcomes;patterns;periphery;permission;permits;planners;platforms;platforms—systems;points;political economy;positions;potential divergence;powerbrokers;practice;practice digital;problem;public;public form;realtime;realtime surveillance;regulatory gray;related technology;remain;research;research strategy;respondents;san;san francisco;similarities;strategy;subject;surveillance;system inhabit;systems;takeaway;taps;technologies;terms;tours;traditional form;traditional urban;urban agriculture;urban core;urban farming;urban foodways;use;use life;use pattern;vertical farming;whereas;york;york ny;“digital”,agriculture link;agricultures;digital;digital urban;gentrification;high tech”;land;land use;links;tech”;tech” digital;urban agriculture;use;“urban;“urban farming,31

This is particularly so in Cape Town where despite frequent droughts and harsh physical conditions the activity has thrived largely as a result of the available organisational and material support to urban gardeners. While several supporting actors (e.g. government institutions and non-governmental organisations) provide various forms of assistance to urban gardeners in the Cape Flats, access to this support is little known. Moreover, there is limited knowledge on the level of coordination of activities among supporting actors in facilitating urban agriculture initiatives in the city. This study examines the linkages between urban gardeners and supporting actors in Mitchells Plain, Cape Town. It is based on a mixed methods approach that employs questionnaire and in-depth interviews to gather information from urban gardeners and supporting officials. The findings show that the nature and strength of the linkages between urban gardeners and supporting actors are critical in determining urban gardening success. The findings also show that there is minimal cooperation among non-state actors operating in Mitchells Plain.

Despite the advancements in agriculture techniques, the rising temperature, increasing frequency of natural disasters and changes in global precipitation concentration have negatively affected the yield of agriculture sectors around the world. Adding to the fact that there is a scarcity for labour in farms worldwide, the agriculture sector is facing an immense challenge to meet the growing demand for agriculture produce. With the largest consumers of said produce concentrated in the urban areas, a new revolution of growing and harvesting produce known as Urban Farming has gained popularity as a green and self-sustaining initiative. Among the common urban farming systems, a plant factory that combines water-based agriculture, vertical farming and controlled environment agriculture, boasting the highest yield and growth rate has the most potential to feed the ever-growing population of urban dwellers. However, plant factories are notorious for their high overhead cost due to the high-power consumption and dependency on human labour. This paper attempts to redesign the typical plant factory layout in order to reduce the need to move the growing trays and enable the implementation of low-cost, simple cartesian robotics. The prototype adopts the lean management principle karakuri kaizen to enable mechanical motion of the growing trays which reduces the amount of vertical and horizontal motion needed by a cartesian robot as well as maximizing the space used for the growing area of any typical plant factory layout. Experimental results show that 90% of 36 seedlings of cabbage have grown successfully within a 6-week period",karakuri kaizen;plant factory;urban farming;vertical farming,,,,World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering,22783091,,,,English,Int J Adv Trends Comput Sci Eng,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85080108822,3,Malaysia,Malaysia,universiti tenaga nasional,universiti tenaga nasional,adopts;advancements;agriculture;agriculture produce;agriculture sector;agriculture technique;amount;area;areas;attempts;average caloric;boasting;cabbage;caloric;caloric intake;capita;cartesian;cartesian robot;cartesian robotics;challenge;changes;combines;common urban;concentration;consumers;consumption;cost;current trend;decade;demand;dependency;disasters;dwellers;environment;environment agriculture;experimental;experimental result;fact;factories;factory;factory layout;farm worldwide;farms;feed;frequency;global precipitation;grown;growth;growth rate;high overhead;highpower;horizontal;horizontal motion;human;human labour;hungrier;immense;immense challenge;implementation;initiative;intake;kaizen;karakuri;labour;layout;lean;lean management;lowcost;management;management principle;mechanical motion;meet;motion;move;natural disaster;need;new revolution;order;overhead;overhead cost;paper;paper attempt;passing;period;plant;plant factory;popularity;population;population growth;precipitation;precipitation concentration;principle;principle karakuri;produce;projections;prototype;prototype adopts;rate;redesign;reduces;result show;results;revolution;robot;robotics;scarcity;sector;sectors;seedlings;show;simple;simple cartesian;space;systems;techniques;temperature;trays;trends;typical plant;urban area;urban dweller;urban farming;vertical farming;waterbased agriculture;world;worldwide;yield,dependency;human;human labour;implementation;labour;lean;lean manufacturing;manufacturing;manufacturing principle;principles;system;vertical farming,34

On the other hand, the public sector has noticed the potential that citizen commitment can have for the maintenance of urban parks, especially during a period of tight communal resources. One possible form of cooperation between the urban community and municipal government is represented by the “Green Godfathers”, in which small green spaces in the roadside environment are cared for by the citizens. The following article shows, using the example of tree slices in the German city of Bonn, the possibilities and limitations of citizen engagement in the field of urban parks. Utilizing quantitative and qualitative methods, the distribution of the “Green Godfathers” in the municipality and the evaluation of the Green Godfathers model were examined from various perspectives. The theoretical background for the article is provided by two different discourses.

It argues that compact high-tech agriculture is not only applicable in dense urban areas but also in peri-urban areas. Indeed, new high-tech systems represent a paradigm shift in farming and food production and offer suitable and efficient methods for peri-urban farming by minimizing maintenance and maximizing yield. Upon reviewing these technologies and examining project prototypes, we find that these efforts do plant the seeds for the realization of efficient and compact forms of large-scale indoor farming. The chapter, however, speculates about the consequences, advantages, and disadvantages of the vertical farm.

Despite a growing body of literature on community gardens, there is a particular gap for a transcontinental bigger N-study on the organisation of community gardening, which we want to fill with a comparative document analysis of 51 urban community gardens in six anglophone and German-speaking countries. Specifically, we want to understand how community gardens are organised as spaces for long-term collective action. We systematically collected and analysed documents such as membership rules, handouts to new members, formal statutes, or blog entries. A cluster analysis helped to identify three types of community garden organisations, which vary in terms of organisational form, membership and exclusion rules, individual versus collective cultivation of the garden area, and the degree of regulation, fees, and waiting lists. Our findings show that there is no single blueprint for a long-term community garden organisation, but that self-organisation or nested forms of organisation and more or less open social boundaries result in distinct places of collective gardening.

Evidences suggest that growing and consuming fresh fruits and vegetables has many health and social benefits. However, urban soils may pose a significant health risk to the public due to contamination from heavy metals, in particular, lead (Pb). Much of the soil in urban areas is contaminated by the historic use of Pb based paints, leaded gasoline, and other industrial activities. This pilot study assesses Pb concentrations in urban garden soils and the behaviors of urban gardeners in New York City. Soil samples from 18 gardens were analyzed for Pb using a field portable XRF Environmental Analyzer. A survey was administered to individuals who tended the gardens to assess their gardening habits. The soil Pb concentrations averaged 373 ppm and ranged 109–1317 ppm. Seventy-three percent of gardeners did not wear any personal protective equipment and half stated that they ate or drank while gardening. The majority of respondents indicated that they just “brushed off” and washed their hands when finished gardening. The findings indicate that these participants work, grow and consume produce from their gardens without knowledge of soil contamination, nor did they take appropriate precautions. The elevated Pb levels in combination of current gardening habits puts the gardening population at risk. Access to soil Pb screening, public outreach and education are clearly necessary",gardening;lead contamination;urban soil,,"Schmeltz, M.T.; School of Public Health-CUNY, 2180 Third Ave, United States; email: mschmeltz@gc.cuny.edu",,Springer,2194315X,,,,English,Springer Geogr,Book Chapter,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85064943351,3,United States,United States,school of public health-cuny;brooklyn college-cuny,school of public health-cuny,access;activities;analyzer;appropriate;appropriate precaution;areas;ass pb;assess;assesses;ate;become;behaviors;benefits;city;combination;concentrations;consume;consume produce;contamination;current gardening;decade;drank;education;environmental analyzer;equipment;evidence suggest;evidences;field;field portable;findings;fresh fruit;fruits;garden;garden soil;gardeners;gardening;gardening habit;gardens;gasoline;grow;habits;half;hands;health;health risk;heavy metal;historic;historic use;indicate;individuals;industrial activity;knowledge;lead;lead pb;levels;majority;many health;metals;new york;off”;outreach;paints;participant work;participants;past;past decade;pb;pb concentration;pb screening;percent;personal protective;pilot;pilot study;population;portable xrf;pose;ppm;precautions;produce;protective;protective equipment;public;public outreach;puts;respondents;risk;samples;seventythree;seventythree percent;significant health;social benefit;soil;soil contamination;soil pb;soil sample;soils;study;study ass;suggest;survey;urban area;urban garden;urban gardener;urban gardening;urban soil;use;vegetables;wear;work;xrf;york;york city,city;city –;exposure;gardeners;lead;lead exposure;new york;pilot;pilot study;soil;soil lead;study;york;york city;–,40

This study examines the development of the urban cultivation (UC) scene in New Orleans over the decade following Hurricane Katrina with a particular focus on entrepreneurial UC projects. By contextualizing in-depth interviews with the growers in the historical events in the city, the study finds that the dominant motives of cultivation projects shifted from social missions to economic interests over time, as the city transitioned from recovery to redevelopment. The study highlights the heterogeneity of UC practices, and questions the current scholarship's tendency to situate urban gardens in opposing theoretical frameworks: tools for neoliberal urbanism or food justice activism. The findings show that the distinction between socially motivated and economically motivated UC cannot be easily drawn. Most of the socially motivated UC projects began adopting market participation over time, while many of the economically motivated UC projects operated as social entrepreneurialism. While growers tended to view themselves as alternative to the dominant political-economic system, they also undoubtedly benefitted from the market-driven redevelopment of the city that expanded UC opportunities",,,"Kato, Y.; Georgetown UniversityUnited States; email: yuki.kato@georgetown.edu",,Blackwell Publishing Ltd,15356841,,,,English,City Commun,Article,Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85077896620,1,United States,United States,georgetown university,georgetown university,activism;alternative;cannot;city;cultivation;cultivation practice;cultivation project;cultivation uc;current scholarship;decade;development;distinction;dominant;dominant motif;dominant politicaleconomic;drawn;economic interest;entrepreneurial uc;entrepreneurialism;events;examines;findings;finds;focus;food;food justice;framework tool;frameworks;gardens;growers;heterogeneity;highlights;historical event;hurricane;hurricane katrina;indepth;indepth interview;interests;interviews;justice;justice activism;katrina;market;market participation;missions;motives;neoliberal urbanism;new orleans;opportunities;orleans;participation;particular focus;politicaleconomic;politicaleconomic system;practices;projects;proliferation;questions;recovery;redevelopment;scene;scholarship;scholarship tendency;scholarships;show;situate;situate urban;social entrepreneurialism;social mission;social transition;spurs;study;study examines;system;tendency;theoretical framework;time;tools;transitions;uc;uc cannot;uc opportunity;uc practice;uc project;uc scene;urban cultivation;urban farming;urban garden;urbanism;view,cultivation;emergence;entrepreneurial cultivation;gardening;new orleans;orleans;postkatrina;times;transition emergence;transitions;urban transition,43

Nevertheless, this field of research largely focuses on primary food production-so-called urban farming-while the subsequent steps of the food chain have scarcely been investigated. In this context, this study aimed to provide a preliminary evaluation of urban food processing, taking mozzarella cheese production in the city of Milan as a case study. Methods: Five urban farmers participated in a direct survey aiming at identifying how sustainable this specific production chain can be considered. Results: Results demonstrated that the concept of urban food production is really valorized through measures able to enhance the global sustainability of the food production process only in some of the dairy micro- enterprises and that the economic dimension must be considered the variable most critically involved in hampering the global sustainability of this specific food chain.

The digital transformation that companies will need to embrace to survive requires new ways of creating, thinking, and working with technology-driven tools to provide value for their businesses and customers. Digitization, whether it pertains to new technologies, the analysis of big data or the development of on-line and spatial applications, can contribute to achieving systemic food production transformation in a way that aligns the sector more closely with contemporary sustainability and health challenges. Digital techniques are leading established companies to renew and innovate their business models by connecting producers to consumers, setting up innovative marketing channels, and improving logistics. Artificial intelligence for smart farming, precision and urban farming, data management for waste-less, blockchain for supply chain traceability and auditability are just some of the disruptive technologies which have been adopting by both start-ups and an increasing number of established companies, redefining their business models.

This study aimed to determine a local definition of urban agriculture for Arkansas and investigated the context of urban agriculture in Arkansas. Design/methodology: This study implemented snowball sampling for 16 qualitative interviews. Findings: The Arkansas-specific definition evolved to small-scale, fewer than 10 acres, diversified, and sustainable farming within city limits that engages with the market, the community, or both. A concept that emerged from the data was a hesitation by participants to be defined only by the term ‘urban farmer’ rather than by other terms such as ‘producer’ or ‘market gardener’. Theoretical implications: The Agro-Ecological Educator Theory provides three concepts (love, dialogical communication, and praxis) that guided the interview process with local food actors, this study expands current research into local food by determining a local definition of urban agriculture to help frame the scope of future Extension programming. Practical implications: Extension personnel are encouraged to investigate the context of urban agriculture and local food systems in their states to frame the types of resources and technical assistance needed by these communities.

Throughout history, different techniques have been used to ensure sustainable urban agricultural production. A good example of this is the chinampa system, which was developed during the time of the Aztecs in the region of Lake Xochimilco, south of Mexico City. A chinampa is a raised field on a small artificial island on a freshwater lake surrounded by canals and ditches. Farmers use local vegetation and mud to construct chinampas. Fences made of a native willow [bonpland willow (Salix bonplandiana)] protect the chinampa from wind, pests, and erosion. The dominating crops are vegetables and ornamentals. The canal water that rises through capillarity to the crops reduces the need for additional irrigation. A considerable portion of the fertility in the soils is system-immanent and generated in the aquatic components of the chinampa. Complex rotations and associations allow up to seven harvests per year. Chinampas also provide ecosystem services, particularly greenhouse gas sequestration and biodiversity diversification, and they offer high recreational potential. Recently, research and community initiatives have been performed to try to recover the productive potential of chinampas and align this sustainable system with the needs of the 21st century. In other parts of the world, some with a history of raised field agriculture, similar efforts are being made. The chinampa model could help supply food and ecosystem services in large cities on or near swamplands, large rivers, or lakes",,,"Ebel, R.; Department of Health and Human Development, Montana State University, Reid Hall 345, United States",,American Society for Horticultural Science,10630198,,HORTF,,English,HortTechnology,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85081209321,1,United States,United States,department of health and human development,department of health and human development,21st century;additional irrigation;agricultural production;agriculture;align;aquatic component;artificial island;associations;aztecs;biodiversity;biodiversity diversification;bonpland;bonpland willow;bonplandiana;canal;canal water;canals;capillarity;century;chinampa;chinampa model;chinampa system;chinampas;cities;city;community;community initiative;complex rotation;components;considerable portion;construct;construct chinampas;crop reduces;crops;developed;different technique;ditches;diversification;ecosystem;ecosystem service;efforts;erosion;example;farmer use;farmers;fences;fertility;field;field agriculture;food;freshwater;freshwater lake;gas;gas sequestration;good example;greenhouse;greenhouse gas;harvests;help;high recreational;history;horticulture;initiatives;irrigation;island;lake;lake xochimilco;lakes;large city;large rivers;local vegetation;many people;mexico;model;mud;native willow;need;needs;offer;ornamentals;parts;people;pests;portion;production;productive potential;protect;provide;provide ecosystem;recover;recreational potential;reduces;region;research;rises;rivers;rotations;salix;salix bonplandiana;sequestration;services;similar effort;small artificial;soils;south;supply;supply food;sustainable system;swamplands;system;systemimmanent;techniques;think;time;try;urban horticulture;use;vegetables;vegetation;water;willow;willow bonpland;willow salix;wind;world;xochimilco;year,aztecs;chinampas;megalopolis;model;modern megalopolis;potential solution;solution;urban farming,47

In cities of the global south, UA is widely analyzed through a productivist lens, focusing on food production and individual or household-level contributions of urban farming to food security, household income, and livelihoods. Meanwhile, in cities of the global north, engagement with UA also speaks to food production and food security but is just as often focused on environmental and social movements, civic engagement and justice, and more recently urban sustainability and resiliency. We argue that productivist and post-productivist dichotomies are somewhat displaced as differences between the GN/GS are becoming less pronounced. Furthermore, such a dichotomy reinforces assumptions about the nature of urbanization itself, eliding both the commonalities among urban spaces and specificities that come from each place. By examining how UA is approached and written about in different contexts, we hope to highlight the gaps, but also to illustrate convergent themes, particularly those that increasingly characterize contemporary UA research. After elaborating on these tensions, we will build on the increasing relevance of the convergences by suggesting some potentially fruitful future directions for UA research. We conclude with ideas about how novel theoretical concepts might be used to identify overlapping themes in useful and insightful ways, and to increase the significance and reach of UA research",food security;global north;global south;political ecology;urban agriculture,,"Gray, L.; Environmental Studies and Sciences, Santa Clara UniversityUnited States; email: lcgray@scu.edu",,Springer,0889048X,,,,English,Agric Hum Values,Review,Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85078480798,3,United States,United States,santa clara university;worcester polytechnic institute;johns hopkins university,santa clara university,agriculture;agriculture ua;argue;assumptions;build;characterize;characterize contemporary;cities;civic;civic engagement;commonalities;concepts;conclude;contemporary ua;contexts;contributions;convergences;convergent;convergent theme;dichotomies;dichotomy;dichotomy reinforces;differences;different context;directions;disconnect;divergence;engagement;food;food production;food security;fruitful;fruitful future;future;future direction;gaps;global north;global south;gn;gngs;gs;highlight;hope;household;household income;householdlevel;householdlevel contribution;ideas;illustrate;illustrate convergent;income;increase;insightful;insightful way;interests;justice;lens;literature;livelihoods;movements;nature;north;north gn;novel;perspectives;place;postproductivist;postproductivist dichotomy;production;productivist;productivist lens;range;reach;reinforces;relevance;research;resiliency;security;significance;social movement;south;south g;spaces;speaks;specificities;sustainability;tensions;themes;theoretical concept;topics;ua;ua research;urban agriculture;urban farming;urban space;urban sustainability;urbanization;ways,agriculture;agriculture north–south;convergence;north–south;north–south convergence;urban agriculture,48

Paradoxically, conventional farming practices are undermining these services and resulting in degraded soils, polluted waters, greenhouse gas emissions and massive loss of biodiversity including declines in pollinators. In essence, farming is undermining the ecosystem services it relies upon. Finding alternative more sustainable ways to meet growing food demands which simultaneously support biodiversity is one of the biggest challenges facing humanity. Here, we review the potential of urban and peri-urban agriculture to contribute to sustainable food production, using the 17 sustainable development goals set by the United Nations General Assembly as a framework. We present new data from a case study of urban gardens and allotments in the city of Brighton and Hove, UK. Such urban and peri-urban landholdings tend to be small and labour-intensive, characterised by a high diversity of crops including perennials and annuals. Our data demonstrate that this type of agricultural system can be highly productive and that it has environmental and social advantages over industrial agriculture in that crops are usually produced using few synthetic inputs and are destined for local consumption. Overall, we conclude that food grown on small-scale areas in and near cities is making a significant contribution to feeding the world and that this type of agriculture is likely to be relatively favourable for some ecosystem services, such as supporting healthy soils.

In reality, these sectors have allowed a typology of the localities, called “Zone”. Prioritization of sectors depends on inside or outside constraints specific of each Zone. The internal constraints are taken as first factors of dynamism and act on the choice of sectors. Therefore, external constraints included in environment productive like price varying constitutes also a dynamic factor. As problematic, the public policy ignores the roles of urban agriculture on development. The main problems are related to food, processing of urban waste. Therefore, the farming systems are dynamic over time. This dynamism is the result of the adaptability of farmers according to the constraints imposed by the city. They involve three product factors: land, capital and labor. The objective of research is to highlight the agricultural dynamism, showed by “Markov chain”.

In this context, land-use change has promoted land abandonment and the consequent accumulation of biomass (fuel) in (progressively less managed) forests and (non-forest) natural land, causing higher fire density and severity, economic damage, and land degradation. The expansion of Wildland-Urban Interfaces (WUIs) further affects fire density by negatively impacting peri-urban farming and livestock density. Assuming the role of grazing in controlling fuel accumulation in forests and non-forest natural land as an indirect measure of wildfire containment around large Mediterranean cities, our work focuses on the role of nomadic livestock, i.e., sheep and goats-the most abundant and traditional farm species in the area. The present study (i) investigates the relationship between fire frequency/extent and livestock decline at the regional level in Greece, (ii) explores changes over time in regional wildfire regimes, comparing Attica, a particularly vulnerable peri-urban region which includes Athens (the Greek capital city), with the rest of the country, and (iii) quantifies trends over time in livestock characteristics (population structure and dynamics) over a sufficiently long time interval (1961-2017) at the same spatial scale, with the aim to document the progressive reduction of nomadic livestock in peri-urban districts. A comprehensive analysis of statistical data, corroborated with a literature review, outlined the relationship between livestock decline over time and changes in specific wildfire characteristics at the regional scale, evidencing peculiar environmental conditions in Attica. In this region, a rapid decline of nomadic livestock was observed compared to in the rest of Greece, leading to a higher wildfire risk. The results of this study suggest that nomadic livestock contributes to sustainable management of peri-urban land, stimulating grazing that may prevent fuel accumulation in fringe woodlands",goats;mediterranean landscape;peri-urban area;sheep;wildfires,,"Salvati, L.; Council for Agricultural Research and Economics, Viale Santa Margherita 80, Italy; email: luca.salvati@crea.gov.it",,MDPI AG,2073445X,,,,English,Land,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85078670096,7,Italy,Italy,department of agricultural and forestry sciences (dafne);computer science and economics department;council for agricultural research and economics;department of political science;council for agricultural research and economics,department of agricultural and forestry sciences (dafne),abandonment;abundant;accumulation;affect fire;affects;aim;analysis;area;areas;athens;attica;biomass;biomass fuel;capital;capital city;change;changes;characteristic population;characteristics;cities;city;comprehensive;comprehensive analysis;conditions;consequent;consequent accumulation;containment;context;contributes;country;damage;data;decline;degradation;density;districts;document;dynamics;e;economic damage;environmental condition;europe;expansion;explores;farm;farm specie;fire;fire density;fire frequencyextent;focuses;forests;frequencyextent;fringe;fringe woodland;fuel;fuel accumulation;goatsthe;grazing;greece;greek;greek capital;i;ii;ii explores;iii;iii quantifies;indirect;indirect measure;interface wuis;interfaces;interval;investigates;land;land abandonment;land degradation;landuse;landuse change;large mediterranean;level;literature;literature review;livestock;livestock characteristic;livestock contributes;livestock decline;livestock density;long time;management;measure;mediterranean;mediterranean city;mediterranean region;natural land;nomadic livestock;peculiar;periurban;periurban district;periurban farming;periurban land;periurban region;population;population structure;present;present study;prevent;prevent fuel;progressive;progressive reduction;quantifies;rapid decline;reduction;regimes;region;regional level;regional scale;regional wildfire;regions;relationship;rest;results;review;risk;role;scale;severity;sheep;spatial scale;species;specific wildfire;statistical data;structure;study;suggest;sustainable management;time;time interval;traditional farm;trends;vulnerable area;vulnerable periurban;wildfire;wildfire characteristic;wildfire containment;wildfire regime;wildfire risk;wildfires;wildlandurban;wildlandurban interface;woodlands;work;work focus;wuis,approach;grazing;greece;interfaces;land;land management;management;mediterranean;regional approach;risk;role;sustainable land;urbanrural interface;wildfire;wildfire risk,51

This system requires much electrical energy supply. In order to save energy, additional electricity supply is needed. For this reason, photovoltaic is installed on the roof of the greenhouse. The obstacle in the installation of photovoltaic cells is that the power produced is not optimal, due to the movement of the sun's position. For this reason, Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) technology is used. In this paper, fuzzy logic was used for MPPT based on I and V from PV. The aim is to find the maximum operating point of a photovoltaic module so that it can increase the output power ratio of photovoltaic modules in varying temperatures and radiation levels. Simulation is done using MATLAB, so that a ratio of output power ratios is generated with and without using an MPPT. By using the fuzzy MPPT controller, it produces optimum power, at P PV max = 250 W, P out max = 160 W, P PV max = 174.8 W, P out max = 125 W, P PV max = 98.97 W, P out max = 75 W. This power will be used to supply electricity for 2 15 W lamps, 12 volts for the mini greenhouse",,fuzzy logic;matlab;maximum power point trackers;photoelectrochemical cells;photovoltaic cells;solar power generation;electrical energy supply;electricity supply;maximum power point tracking;maximum power point tracking controller (mppt);photovoltaic modules;photovoltaic systems;smart greenhouse;varying temperature;greenhouses,"Setiawan, H.; Electrical Engineering Departement, State Polytechnic of Malang, Jl.

With the world continuing to urbanise, traditional forms of agriculture are diminishing, driving exploration into alternatives methods of food production. Urban farming is becoming a growing phenomenon with individuals investing in methods, such as WindowFarms, Aquafarms and vertical farms as a means of supplementing their food supply. Applications of alternative growing methods have centred on domestic settings or localised communities, and limited research has explored urban farming methods used in workplaces. This paper presents the findings of four alternative food growing applications within a workplace, to explore the viability of future implementations within similar workplace contexts. The findings from this study can be used to better understand the sociotechnical challenges of growing food in unique urban environments, presenting opportunities for urban farming to occur in a variety of settings that are not limited to domestic applications",food;hci;permaculture;urban agriculture;window farming,agriculture;food products;food supply;achieving it;food production;food security;office environments;permaculture;sociotechnical;urban agricultures;urban environments;human computer interaction,"Farr-Wharton, G.; Open Lab, School of Computing, Newcastle UniversityUnited Kingdom; email: Geremy.Farr-Wharton@csiro.au",,Association for Computing Machinery,,9781450376969,,,English,ACM Int Conf Proc Ser,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85078696267,1,United Kingdom;Australia,United Kingdom,school of computing;australian ehealth research centre,school of computing,agriculture;alternative;alternative food;alternative method;alternatives;applications;aquafarms;challenges;communities;concern;contexts;domestic application;domestic setting;environments;exploration;explore;farms;findings;food;food production;food security;food supply;forms;future;future implementation;global concern;implementations;individual investing;individuals;means;methods;occur;opportunities;paper;paper present;phenomenon;presents;production;research;security;settings;shortage;similar workplace;sociotechnical challenge;study;supply;traditional form;understand;unique;urban environment;urban farming;urbanise;variety;vertical farm;viability;windowfarms;workplace;workplace context;workplaces;world,environments;feed;food;grow;hci;office;office environment;seed,53

In urban areas, social networks tend to be fragmented and diverse, and hence building community resilience is a challenge. Our objective is to shed light on how social network structures affect community resilience in two urban gardening groups in South Africa. The results of this qualitative study show that the two non-hierarchical groups place a strong emphasis on key personalities as leaders. The common motivation and shared values of the group help individuals overcome social heterogeneity and form trust. A decentralized network structure with different kinds of leaders helps group members divide power and responsibility; it also promotes a sense of ownership and capacity building in its members. Moreover, a no-money policy supports independence from access to financial resources, makes the group self-sufficient, and prevents conflict. Our results suggest that for a certain size of group, working in local clusters can create a decentralized network and a redundant leadership structure",community resilience;social networks;south africa;urban agriculture;western cape,capacity building;community organization;leadership;policy making;social network;urban agriculture;south africa;western cape,"Wesselow, M.; Carl von Ossietzky Universitat Oldenburg, Ammerlander Heerstraße 114–118, Germany; email: Maren.wesselow@uol.de",,Springer,03007839,,,,English,Hum Ecol,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85076324910,2,Germany;South Africa,Germany,carl von ossietzky universitat oldenburg;nelson mandela university,carl von ossietzky universitat oldenburg,access;affect;affect community;africa;areas;building;building community;capacity;capacity building;certain size;challenge;clusters;common motivation;community;community resilience;conflict;create;different kind;diverse;divide;divide power;emphasis;financial resource;form;form trust;gardening;group;group help;group member;group place;group selfsufficient;groups;help;help group;help individual;helps;hence;hence building;heterogeneity;independence;individual overcome;individuals;key;key personality;kinds;leader help;leaders;leadership;leadership structure;light;local cluster;member divide;members;moreover;motivation;network;network structure;network tend;networks;nomoney;nomoney policy;nonhierarchical group;objective;overcome;ownership;personalities;place;policy;policy support;power;prevents;promotes;qualitative;qualitative study;redundant;redundant leadership;resilience;resources;responsibility;result suggest;results;selfsufficient;sense;show;size;social heterogeneity;social network;south;south africa;strong emphasis;structure;structure affect;structures;study;study show;suggest;support independence;supports;tend;trust;urban area;urban gardening;values,africa;community;community resilience;gardening;gardening network;hands;money;needs;networks;plants”;plants” forming;resilience;south;south africa;urban gardening;“who,54

Nevertheless, contaminated vegetables can cause health problems because of their microbial load. The aim of this study was to assess the microbial quality of three main leafy vegetables cultivated and consumed at Porto-Novo in Republic of Benin. Methods: Totally, 36 samples of amaranth, nightshade, and lettuce were taken from three districts of Porto-Novo at urban gardening level. The samples were tested microbiologically according to international standards for determination of aerobic mesophilic bacteria, total coliforms, faecal coliforms, Clostridium perfringens, faecal streptococci, and Salmonella spp. The results were analyzed using SPSS software v. 16.0. Results: In total, aerobic mesophilic bacteria counts in leafy vegetables ranged from 4.42x105 to 1.08x106 Colony Forming Unit (CFU)/g. The highest and lowest total coliform loads were found in lettuces (3.21x103 CFU/g) and the nightshades (1.78x102CFU/g), showing significant (p&lt;0.05) difference. Faecal streptococci load ranged from 1.01x103 to 3.18x103 CFU/g and was significantly (p&lt;0.05) higher in amaranths than in lettuces and nightshades. C. perfringens ranged from 0.633x101 to 1.18x101 CFU/g. Salmonella spp. was absent in all vegetables.

However, a substantial share of the material requirements come from outside their urban environments. With urban environments producing a large share of residual and waste streams, extensive potential exists to employ these material and energy streams as inputs in urban farming systems to promote more circular economy approaches. The aim of this article is to assess the environmental performance of employing residual material flows for vertical hydroponic farming in urban environments in order to support more circular, resilient, and sustainable urban food supply. Life cycle assessment (LCA) is used to assess replacing conventional growing media and fertilizers with urban residual streams. Paper, compost, and brewers' spent grains were assessed for replacements to conventional gardening soil employed in the studied system. Biogas digestate was also assessed as a replacement for conventional fertilizers used in the recirculating water bath. The results suggest that large environmental performance benefits are illustrated when conventional growing media is replaced. Although not as significant, employing fertilizers from residual urban streams also leads to large potential benefits, suggesting the two residual streams have the potential for more circular hydroponic systems",circular economy;food;horticulture;hydroponic;industrial symbiosis;life cycle assessment (lca);urban farming;urban symbiosis,economic activity;energy;farming system;food supply;horticulture;hydroponics;life cycle analysis;material flow analysis;performance assessment;urban agriculture,"Martin, M.; IVL Swedish Environmental Research Institute, Life Cycle Management and Sustainable Society, Valhallavagen 81, Sweden; email: michael.martin@ivl.se",,MDPI AG,20711050,,,,English,Sustainability,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85076682923,3,Sweden,Sweden,ivl swedish environmental research institute;kth royal institute of technology,ivl swedish environmental research institute,aim;approach;approaches;areas;article;ass replacing;assess;assessment;assessment lca;bath;benefits;biogas;biogas digestate;brewer spent;brewers;circular;circular economy;circular hydroponic;compost;conventional fertilizer;conventional gardening;cycle;cycle assessment;digestate;economy;economy approach;employ;energy;energy stream;environmental performance;environments;exists;extensive potential;fertilizers;flows;food;food production;food supply;gardening;gardening soil;grains;hydroponic;hydroponic farming;hydroponic system;inputs;large potential;large share;lca;leads;life;life cycle;material;material flow;material requirement;media;order;paper;performance;performance benefit;potential benefit;potential exists;production;promote;provide;replacement;replacements;requirement come;requirements;residual material;residual stream;residual urban;resilient;resilient food;result suggest;results;share;soil;spent;spent grain;streams;studied system;substantial share;suggest;supply;support;system;systems;urban area;urban environment;urban farming;urban food;urban stream;vertical farming;vertical hydroponic;waste;waste stream;water;water bath,environmental performance;hydroponic;hydroponic farming;performance;symbiosis;urban symbiosis;vertical hydroponic,56

We investigated the impact of gardening activities on five soil functions and the relationship between plant (600 spp.) and soil fauna (earthworms: 18 spp., springtails: 39 spp.) in 85 urban gardens (170 sites) across the city of Zurich (Switzerland). Our results suggest that high plant diversity in gardens had a positive effect on soil fauna and soil multifunctionality, and that garden management intensity decreased plant diversity. Indices of biological activity in soil, such as organic and microbial carbon and bacterial abundance, showed a direct positive effect on soil multifunctionality. Soil moisture and disturbance, driven by watering and tilling, were the driving forces structuring plant and soil fauna communities. Plant indicator values proved useful to assess soil fauna community structure, even in anthropogenic plant assemblages. We conclude that to enhance soil functions, gardeners should increase plant diversity, and lower management intensity. Soil protective management practices, such as applying compost, mulch or avoiding soil tilling, should be included in urban green space planning to improve urban biodiversity and nature’s contribution to people",,,"Tresch, S.; Research Institute of Organic Agriculture (FiBL), Department of Soil Sciences, Ackerstrasse 113, Switzerland; email: tresch.simon@gmail.com",,Nature Publishing Group,20452322,,,31278335.0,English,Sci Rep,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85068457084,7,Switzerland;Germany,Switzerland,research institute of organic agriculture (fibl);swiss federal research institute wsl;university of neuchatel;department of environmental system science;university of konstanz,research institute of organic agriculture (fibl),abundance;activities;activity;anthropogenic;anthropogenic plant;ass soil;assemblages;assess;bacterial;bacterial abundance;biodiversity;biological activity;carbon;cities;city;communities;community;community structure;compost;conclude;contribution;disturbance;diversity;driven;earthworm;earthworm spp;earthworms;ecosystem;ecosystem service;effect;enhance;enhance soil;essential ecosystem;fauna;force structuring;forces;foster;foster biodiversity;functions;garden;garden management;garden site;gardeners;gardening;gardening activity;gardens;green space;high plant;human;impact;increase;increase plant;indicator;indicator value;indices;intensity;management;management intensity;management practice;microbial;microbial carbon;moisture;mulch;multifunctionality;nature’s;people;planning;plant;plant assemblage;plant diversity;plant indicator;plant spp;popular green;positive effect;practices;protective;protective management;provide;relationship;result suggest;results;services;site;sites;soil;soil fauna;soil function;soil moisture;soil multifunctionality;soil protective;space;space planning;spaces;spp;springtail;springtails;structure;structuring plant;suggest;support;support human;switzerland;time;time foster;urban biodiversity;urban garden;values;zurich,aboveground;belowground;belowground diversity;diversity;diversity influencing;effects;gardening;indirect;indirect effect;multifunctionality;soil;soil multifunctionality;urban gardening,58

However, few have focused on the estimation of corresponding water and irrigation management requirements. These issues are addressed in this work in reference to substrate, physical and hydraulic properties and irrigation systems. The studied LGW is located in the itd-UPM building (Madrid) and was studied for 109 days. This paper measures the annual water consumption of this LGW and its plant phenology cycle while adapting methodologies to agricultural crops and to traditional urban gardening methods based on 4 months of daily data collection. The landscape coefficient (KL) was calculated as the rate between the measured values of real and reference evapotranspiration and as real evapotranspiration and was estimated with the WUCOLS III method. We obtained a KL-curve of 0.32 (for the winter) to 0.6 (for the summer) based on the three components of the KL (species Ks, microclimate Kmc and planta density coefficient Kd). From these results, one can schedule LGW irrigation in a more optimal manner than methods traditionally used, which are based on trial and error. Appropriate irrigation design, operation and irrigation management was assessed by measuring the substrate water content (θ) distribution around the LGW and by analyzing differences with an ANOVA and Tukey's honestly significant difference test. LGW irrigation involved a combination of drip irrigation and percolation, producing a border effect and resulting in the development of two hydro zones: one located in the upper LGW (12% of the total area) with a water deficit and the other located at the base (88% of the total area) with a high θ and prone to root asphyxia water. Both are in a fragile equilibrium and can be maintained or improved upon by following the recommendations given in this paper",irrigation uniformity;landscape coefficient;substrate moisture content;vertical gardening,agricultural management;assessment method;estimation method;evapotranspiration;irrigation system;landscape;phenology;vegetation cover;turkey,"Segovia-Cardozo, D.A.; Research Group Hydraulics for Irrigation HIDER, Departamento de Ingenieria Agroforestal.

An on-farm experiment was established to examine the effects of sodium (Na) and bicarbonate (HCO3−)-loaded industrial wastewater on soil and crops on the one hand, and to determine melioration effects on soil condition and plant development on the other hand. To ameliorate the sodified soil, fine-powdered gypsum (CaSO4) was applied as soil amendment onto the upper soil (0–20 cm) before sowing of crops. Depending on soil pH and exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP), which reflected the level of soil degradation (SDL), two different amounts of gypsum were applied: 6.8 t ha−1 in moderate and 10 t ha−1 in high SDL plots. Subsequently rainfed maize (Zea mays L.) and irrigated spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.) under two irrigation water qualities (clean and wastewater) were cultivated. Chemical and physical soil parameters, as well as plant root density (RLD), crop yield and concentrations of major plant nutrients and Na were determined. The results showed that gypsum application reduced soil pH on average below 8 and reduced ESP below 18%. Furthermore, gypsum-treated soils showed a significant reduction of sodium absorption rate (SAR) from 14.0 to 7.9 and aggregate stability was increased from 44.2 to 51.2%. This in return diminished Na concentration in plant tissues up to 80% and significantly increased RLD of maize. Overall, calcium (Ca) addition through the gypsum amendment changed the soil cation balance by increasing the Ca:Mg ratio from 3.5 to 7.8, which likely influenced the complex interactions between competing cations at the exchange surfaces of the soil and cation uptake by plant roots",bicarbonate;sodification;soil amelioration;spinacia oleracea;west africa;zea mays,alkalinity;calcium compounds;crops;grain (agricultural product);gypsum;gypsum plants;irrigation;positive ions;sodium bicarbonate;water quality;bicarbonate;sodification;soil amelioration;spinacia oleracea;west africa;zea mays;soils;bicarbonate;calcium;calcium sulfate;magnesium;sodium;bicarbonate;gypsum;industrial waste;irrigation;leafy vegetable;maize;sodic soil;soil amendment;solidification;urban agriculture;wastewater;article;burkina faso;cation transport;concentration (parameter);cultivated land;harvest period;irrigation (agriculture);maize;nonhuman;plant nutrient;plant root;plant tissue;sodium absorption;soil acidity;soil amendment;soil degradation;soil property;sowing;spinach;urban area;waste water management;burkina faso;ouagadougou;spinacia oleracea;zea mays,"Stenchly, K.; Organic Plant Production and Agroecosystems Research in the Tropics and Subtropics (OPATS), Universitat Kassel, Steinstrasse 19, Germany; email: stenchly@uni-kassel.de",,Springer,00496979,,WAPLA,,English,Water Air Soil Pollut,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85075692471,6,Germany;Burkina Faso,Germany,universitat kassel;institut de l’environnement et de recherches agricoles (inera);l’institut des sciences de l’environnement et du developement rural (isedr);department of soil science - soil ecology,universitat kassel,absorption;absorption rate;addition;aggregate;aggregate stability;alkaline;ameliorate;amendment;amounts;application;balance;bicarbonate;calcium;camg;caso4;cation;cation balance;cation uptake;cations;chemical;city;city population;clean;cm;complex interaction;concentration;concentrations;condition;crop;crop yield;crops;degradation;degradation sdl;demands;density;density rld;determine;determine melioration;development;different amount;effects;esp;examine;exchange;exchange surface;exchangeable sodium;experiment;food;food demand;fresh food;gardening;gardening system;gypsum;gypsum amendment;gypsum application;gypsum caso4;hand;ha−1;help;high sdl;industrial wastewater;interactions;irrigate;irrigate crop;irrigation;irrigation water;l;level;lowquality;lowquality water;maize;maize zea;major plant;mays;meet;melioration;melioration effect;moderate;na;nutrients;oleracea;oleracea l;onfarm;onfarm experiment;parameters;percentage;percentage esp;ph;physical soil;plant;plant development;plant nutrient;plant root;plant tissue;plots;population;qualities;quality clean;rainfed;rate;rate sar;ratio;reduction;results;return;rld;root;root density;roots;sar;sdl;sdl plot;semiarid;semiarid tropic;significant reduction;sodic;sodic alkaline;sodium;sodium absorption;sodium na;sodium percentage;soil;soil amendment;soil cation;soil condition;soil degradation;soil parameter;soil ph;soils;spinach;spinach spinacia;spinacia;spinacia oleracea;stability;surfaces;systems;tissues;tropics;upper soil;uptake;urban gardening;wastewater;water;water quality;yield;zea,agriculture;alkaline;amendment;burkina;burkina faso;faso;gypsum;gypsum amendment;industrial wastewater;irrigation;ouagadougou;plants;sodic;sodic alkaline;soil;urban agriculture;wastewater;wastewater irrigation,60

This problem causes the food prices to escalate because of its limited amount, but on the other hand, the requests are kept on increasing. Now on, food security is an important issue for Surabaya City. Thus, efforts of increasing the food security level must be done, one of these efforts is urban farming. This study aims to locate the suitable areas for urban farming activities at Surabaya City. To gain that aim, an analysis method of Wight Overlay is used.

We previously documented P in leachate from raised-bed garden plots in which compost had been applied, but the fate of this P is not known. Here, we measured P concentrations in soils below four or six-year-old urban garden plots that were established for research. We hypothesize that the soil P concentration and depth of P penetration will increase over time after gardens are established. Soil cores were collected in five garden plots of each age and quantified for inorganic weakly exchangeable P. Inorganic weakly exchangeable P was significantly elevated in native soil below garden plots (>35 cm deep) relative to reference soil profiles, and excess P decreased with increasing depth, although differences between garden plots of different ages were not significant. Our analysis shows that excess P from compost accumulates in native soil below urban garden plots.

I support this argument with ethnographic, interview, and archival data from a nascent urban farming project. After describing how project founders defined a compelling future of “sustainable community,” I identify a process called imaginative imputation through which a diverse set of participants aligned themselves with the project.

Consequently, there has been an increase in the number of spontaneous and informal settlements being constructed as cities do not keep up with the planning and infrastructure development for new arrivals. Urban dwellers in informal, unplanned settlements where issues of land tenure and access to services are prevalent have, consequently, been exposed to precarious living conditions with limited access to food and water scarcity. Urban agriculture (UA) strategies have been adopted by those residents to alleviate poverty and food insecurity, and have been seen to perform other functions, such as environmental, social, cultural and developmental. This study explores challenges and opportunities for sustainable urban farming as an integrated environmental management strategy for the upgrading of informal settlements in three case studies in Durban. This paper demonstrates the need for municipalities to support community driven processes to ensure sustainability of UA initiatives and sustained investment for maintenance.

Three fertilizers treatments (an unfertilized Control, F0; farm yard manure, FYM (F1) at 14.2 t dry matter (DM) ha-1 containing 108 kg Nitrogen (N), 27kg Phosphorus (P) and a mineral fertilizer treatment (F2) containing the same amount of N and P as in F1 were established during 2011-12. Fertilizer treatments were factorally combined with two irrigation levels i.e. RI; recommended irrigation when irrigation was applied weekly and HRI; half than recommended irrigation where irrigation was applied fortnightly. Subplots randomized within each main plot were assigned to either of the two vegetable species pea (Pisum sativum L.), cauliflower (Brassica oleracea L.). Highest crop dry matter yields (p&gt;0.05) were recorded for pea (12 t ha−) under F2 and lowest for cauliflower in RI (6.2 t ha−) under F1 treatment, respectively. Dry matter yields of both crops were reduced to 11−8% by reducing applying half of the HRI presumably due to water stress. Contrarily, water use efficiencies of both crops were significantly (32-36%) higher under HRI treatment than under RI. Apparent nutrient use efficiencies for C, N, P and K varied widely ranged from 27- 34%. However partial nutrient balances of major nutrients specially for K, remained negative.

When planning the building envelope of the three buildings which range from four to six floors, the responsible persons consciously decided to use the Wienerberger ""Porotherm 50 W.i. Plan"" brick. Thus, the first multi-storey residential building project has been constructed using the latest brick generation. The use of a mineral and monocoque construction method makes a significant contribution to eliminating the need for petroleum-based full heat insulation. Therefore, the building complex can throughout be categorized as a low-energy building. Further notable advantages of the applied construction method and building design include the use of an exterior wall system without additional insulation (upgraded insulation on the outside) to obtain a U-value of 0.12 W/m2K which corresponds the passive house standards. The high demands of the construction design in terms of ecological, economical and socio-cultural quality of the three building components are reflected in the ecological selection of construction materials, the persistence of the building complex and the stability of value, as well as apartment sizes, assisted living, smart-start-apartments, integrated green space concepts, roof terraces, urban gardening, etc. The TQB certification with 769 out of 1000 points has been obtained and the project has been awarded with klimaaktiv GOLD to prove the quality of the project and ensure quality assurance and management",,apartment houses;architectural design;brick;ecology;heating;insulation;project management;quality assurance;roofs;sustainable development;additional insulation;building complexes;construction design;construction method;low energy buildings;residential building;residential complexes;responsible person;construction,,Passer A.Lutzkendorf T.Habert G.Kromp-Kolb H.Monsberger M.,Institute of Physics Publishing,17551307,,,,English,IOP Conf Ser Earth Environ Sci,Conference Paper,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85073035237,1,Austria,Austria,,,additional insulation;advantages;apartment;apartment size;aspern;association;assurance;brick;brick generation;building;building complex;building component;building design;building envelope;building project;buildings;certification;city;components;concepts;construction;construction design;construction material;construction method;construction site;contribution;corresponds;d22;demands;design;district;ecological selection;employees;envelope;etc;exterior;floors;full heat;gardening;generation;gold;green space;heat;heat insulation;high demand;house;house standard;i;include;insulation;klimaaktiv;lakeside;lakeside city;land;living;lowenergy;lowenergy building;management;materials;method;mineral;monocoque;monocoque construction;multistorey;need;notable advantage;passive;passive house;persistence;persons;plan;plan brick;planning;plot;point;points;porotherm;porotherm w;private employee;project;prove;quality;quality assurance;range;residential building;residential complex;responsible person;roof;roof terraces;selection;significant contribution;sisters;site;site d22;sizes;smartstartapartments;sociocultural quality;space;space concept;stability;standards;system;terms;terraces;tqb;tqb certification;upgraded insulation;urban gardening;use;value;vienna;w;wall;wall system;wienerberger;wm2k,klimaaktiv;month;object;sisters,69

The long-term sustainability visions (in Switzerland the ""2000 W Society"" by year 2100) imply not only technological changes but above all radical changes in the human behaviour. A multidisciplinary study, carried out by SUPSI and specialists, proposes a method for determining the parameters for the design of a building by year 2100. It also shows that in order to achieve long-term sustainability goals (primary energy reduction and CO2 emissions per capita, 2000 W and max 1 ton CO2), alimentation can be considered as a building need. The high potential in reducing primary energy needs in this area makes possible to compensate others energy consumptions and CO2 emissions of the building inhabitants and of the building itself.

Yet, its success rate is particularly dependent on the managerial capacities of urban gardeners to coordinate and organize collective actions for the successful exploitation of the gardens. The calls from governments to organize cooperative structures among farmers seem justified and merits a high priority on agricultural policy agendas. Although principles of cooperative structures exist, there is no blueprint available that indicates how to start a gardeners' cooperation. Moreover, these collaborations need to ally with and build on existing social structures of the urban gardeners involved. Our research can contribute to this alignment process by exploring and comparing international standards of prevailing organizations and their functioning among 261 gardeners in two cities in Benin. We found that a vast majority of urban gardeners are members of a cooperation. Nevertheless, their membership is largely titular because gardeners mostly behave semi-autonomously and few decisions are taken collectively. The obvious economic advantages of leveraging bargaining power, reducing transaction costs, and increasing possibilities for loans are seriously underutilized. We suggest that capacity building can help to develop cooperation among urban gardeners to reach their full potential which, congruently, should also improve the livelihoods of the urban poor",africa;allotment gardens;cities;collective action;cooperative longevity;functioning;management;urban agriculture,,"Houessou, D.M.; Athena Institute, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, De Boelelaan 1085, Netherlands; email: donaldhouessou@gmail.com",,MDPI AG,20711050,,,,English,Sustainability,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85071963713,8,Netherlands;Benin,Netherlands,athena institute;laboratoire d'etude sur la pauvrete et la performance de l'agriculture (leppa);centre d'actions pour l'environnement et le developpement durable;amsterdam centre for world food studies;centre for international cooperation,athena institute,actions;advantages;agendas;agricultural policy;alignment;alignment process;bargaining;behave;benin;blueprint;build;building;calls;capacities;capacity;capacity building;cities;collaboration need;collaborations;collective;collective action;contribute;cooperation;cooperative;cooperative structure;coordinate;costs;decisions;dependent;diet;diet diversity;diversity;economic advantage;exist;exploitation;farmers;found;full potential;gardener;gardener cooperation;gardeners;gardening;gardening offer;gardens;governments;help;high priority;indicates;international standard;livelihoods;loans;majority;managerial;managerial capacity;members;membership;merits;moreover;need;offers;option;organizations;policy;policy agenda;possibilities;power;principles;priority;process;rate;reach;research;seem;social structure;standards;start;structures;success;success rate;successful exploitation;suggest;titular;transaction;transaction cost;urban gardener;urban gardening;vast;vast majority;viable option,benin;case;case study;cooperations;cooperatives;factors;gardeners;organization;study;transition;urban gardener,71

In recent decades, interest in producing food in cities has grown dramatically, with an estimated 30% of the global urban population engaged in some form of food production. Identifying and managing the insect biodiversity found on city farms is a complex task often requiring years of study and specialization, especially in urban landscapes which have a complicated tapestry of fragmentation, diversity, pollution, and introduced species. Supporting urban growers with relevant data informs insect management decision-making for both growers and their neighbors, yet this information can be difficult to come by. In this study, we introduced several web-based citizen science programs that can connect growers with useful data products and people to help with the who, what, where, and when of urban insects. Combining the power of citizen science volunteers with the efforts of urban farmers can result in a clearer picture of the diversity and ecosystem services in play, limited insecticide use, and enhanced non-chemical alternatives. Connecting urban farming practices with citizen science programs also demonstrates the ecosystem value of urban agriculture and engages more citizens with the topics of food production, security, and justice in their communities",ebutterfly;inaturalist;insect management;nature’s notebook;urban insect diversity;usa national phenology network,,"Prudic, K.L.; School of Natural Resources and the Environment, University of ArizonaUnited States; email: klprudic@email.arizona.edu",,MDPI AG,20754450,,,,English,Insects,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85073386700,7,United States,United States,school of natural resources and the environment;national coordinating office;office of digital innovation and stewardship,school of natural resources and the environment,agriculture;alternatives;biodiversity;cities;citizen;citizen science;citizens;city;city farm;clearer;clearer picture;communities;complex task;connect;connect grower;data;decades;demonstrates;diversity;ecosystem;ecosystem service;ecosystem value;efforts;engages;farmers;farming practice;farms;food;food production;form;found;fragmentation;gardens;global urban;growers;grown;help;information;informs;insect;insect biodiversity;insect management;insecticide;insecticide use;insects;interest;justice;landscape;landscapes;limited insecticide;management;management decisionmaking;neighbors;nonchemical alternative;part;people;picture;play;pollution;population;power;practices;production;products;programs;recent decade;relevant;relevant data;result;scale;scale farm;science;science program;science volunteer;security;services;small scale;specialization;species;study;tapestry;task;topics;urban agriculture;urban farmer;urban farming;urban grower;urban insect;urban landscape;urban population;use;useful data;value;volunteers;years,almanac;citizen;citizen science;data;farmer’s;farmer’s almanac;science;science data;urban farmer’s,72

Singapore is the second most densely populated country in the world and its high-rise buildings play a critical role in the urban context offering a significantly larger surface area of walls than roofs. PFs represent an appropriate, novel technological response to a number of issues Singapore is facing such as a high dependence on imported energy and food, scarcity of land, planned reduction of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and the increase of high-rise greenery coverage. The potential of PFs in harvesting solar energy, which is currently the most viable renewable energy source (RES), and in utilizing the characteristics of the urban context, is promising. The study analyses the acceptance of the developed PF concept by its potential future users—residents of high-rise public housing blocks. A door-to-door survey was conducted among the residents of the Housing & Development Board (HDB) buildings (consisting of apartments or flats) with two main purposes: examining whether the residents accept or are positively inclined towards the PF concept and its implementation and secondly, identifying their preferences related to aesthetical qualities, use and maintenance of PF designs. The results indicate a highly affirmative response among a very high percentage of respondents towards gardening. They also indicate that PF concepts promoting small-scale VF adequately fit the needs of HDB residents. The preferences of the potential future users regarding PF types are further presented and discussed. The insights obtained will help further the knowledge on PFs and directly assist planners, architects, contractors and decision makers (DMs) as guidelines in the design of PFs in the tropics, enabling such systems to meet the needs, expectations and preferences of users and to address their concerns",building-integrated photovoltaic (bipv);survey;sustainable buildings;urban farming;users' acceptance;vertical farming,decision making;doors;greenhouse gases;intelligent buildings;modular construction;solar energy;surveying;surveys;tall buildings;building integrated photovoltaic;sustainable building;urban farming;users' acceptance;vertical farming;housing,"Kosoric, V.Bumelochstrasse 1, Starrkirch-Wil, Switzerland; email: vesna.kosoric@gmail.com",,Elsevier Ltd,13640321,,RSERF,,English,Renewable Sustainable Energy Rev,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85065733883,5,Switzerland;Singapore,Singapore,department of architecture;department of biological sciences,department of architecture,accept;acceptance;act;address;aesthetical quality;affirmative response;analyses;apartments;appropriate;architects;area;assist;assist planner;blocks;board;board hdb;building;building envelope;building play;buildings;characteristics;concept;concepts;concerns;context;context offering;contractors;country;coverage;critical role;decision;decision maker;dependence;design;designs;developed;development;development board;dms;doortodoor;doortodoor survey;energy;energy source;envelope;envelope system;expectations;facade pfs;facades;fit;flats;food;future;future user;future users—residents;gardening;gas ghgs;gases;ghgs;greenery;greenery coverage;greenhouse;greenhouse gas;guidelines;hdb;hdb building;hdb resident;help;high dependence;high percentage;highrise;highrise building;highrise greenery;highrise public;housing;housing block;housing development;implementation;inclined towards;increase;indicate;insights;integrate;integrate photovoltaic;issue singapore;issues;knowledge;land;main purpose;maintenance;maker dm;makers;meet;modular;modular building;multifunctional;needs;novel;number;offering;panels;percentage;pf;pf concept;pf design;pf type;pfs;pfs represent;photovoltaic;photovoltaic pv;planners;planters;play;populated country;potential future;preferences;productive facade;promising;public;public housing;purposes;pv;pv panel;qualities;reduction;renewable energy;represent;res;resident accept;residents;respondent towards;respondents;response;result indicate;results;role;roofs;scarcity;singapore;smallscale;smallscale vf;solar;solar energy;source;source re;study;study analysis;surface;surface area;survey;systems;technological response;towards;tropics;types;urban context;use;users;users—residents;vertical farming;vf;vf planter;viable renewable;walls;world,acceptance;blocks;concept;facade;facade concept;highrise;highrise public;housing;housing block;photovoltaic;productive facade;public;public housing;singapore;social acceptance;survey;systems,73

As an example, a residential neighbourhoods in arid climate has been discussed as a case study in practice in this paper. It has been developed to implement the sustainable strategies and concepts. It demonstrates a mixed-use community which integrates the sustainability dimensions to improve the quality toward sustainable living in a small community (about 4000 persons), allocated in Dubai land area. This paper aims to highlight the sustainable practices in the arid zones and to give an overview about the performance of the clean energy and renewable in these areas. The studied development has been selected to evaluate such techniques and strategies in the gulf region (Dubai). Various environmental categories such as; on energy, water, mobility, energy consumption of the buildings and infrastructure, urban green spaces, solid waste management and urban farming, have been appraised in this study. It has been noticed that the urban design proposed reduces its potable water consumption by 40% and for energy demands by 57% compared to conventional households. The solar production can cover around 38% of the energy consumption on average.

Their social and environmental benefits offer considerable solutions for sustainable urban design, which is a critical concern in the era of climate change. Additionally, other concern of compacts cities is to improve the quality of their neglected open space and accommodate the city lifestyle. These concerns mentioned above lead to a noticeable trend of designing renovated open space (OS) using urban gardening (UG) in recent years, intending to raise awareness of natural resource in the urban area. In Japan particularly, research proves that gardening for leisure is improving the well-being of urban citizen, especially in Tokyo metropolitan. However, the past research focus was on the impact of UG on people, the management or the technic employed but not on the spatial quality itself, like the one in the author's previous study. In the author's recent work, open space with urban gardening (OSUG) was examined firstly through the user's eyes to reveal their experience in space. Then seven scenarios were identified to determine the quality of urban space in OSUG, as characterized by the variation of three factors: Usage, Space Affordance, and Image of Identity.

Recently, vertical farming systems have emerged as a potential solution for urban farming. However, although there is an increasing body of literature reviewing the potential of urban and vertical farming systems, only a limited number of studies have reviewed the sustainability of these systems. The aim of this article was to understand the environmental impacts of vertical hydroponic farming in urban environments applied to a case study vertical hydroponic farm in Stockholm, Sweden. This was carried out by evaluating environmental performance using a life cycle perspective to assess the environmental impacts and comparing to potential scenarios for improvement options. The results suggest that important aspects for the vertical hydroponic system include the growing medium, pots, electricity demand, the transportation of raw materials and product deliveries. By replacing plastic pots with paper pots, large reductions in GHG emissions, acidification impacts, and abiotic resource depletion are possible. Replacing conventional gardening soil as the growing medium with coir also leads to large environmental impact reductions. However, in order to further reduce the impacts from the system, more resource-efficient steps will be needed to improve impacts from electricity demand, and there is potential to develop more symbiotic exchanges to employ urban wastes and by-products",growing medium;hydroponics;life cycle assessment (lca);plant factory;sustainable production;urban farming,acidification;environmental impact assessment;food production;greenhouse gas;hydroponics;life cycle analysis;literature review;resource depletion;sustainability;urban agriculture;stockholm [sweden];sweden,"Martin, M.; IVL Swedish Environmental Research Institute, Valhallavagen 81, Sweden; email: michael.martin@ivl.se",,MDPI AG,20711050,,,,English,Sustainability,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85070464685,2,Sweden,Sweden,ivl swedish environmental research institute;kth-royal institute of technology,ivl swedish environmental research institute,abiotic resource;acidification;acidification impacts;aim;article;aspects;assess;body;byproducts;case;case study;closer;coir;conventional gardening;cycle;cycle perspective;deliveries;demand;depletion;dynamics;electricity;electricity demand;emissions;employ;employ urban;environmental impact;environmental performance;environments;exchanges;farm;food;food market;food production;gardening;gardening soil;ghg;ghg emission;global food;hydroponic;hydroponic farm;hydroponic farming;hydroponic system;impact;impact reduction;impacts;important aspect;improvement;improvement option;include;large reduction;leads;life;life cycle;limited number;literature;markets;materials;medium;method closer;methods;number;options;order;paper;paper pot;performance;perspective;plastic;plastic pot;population;potential scenario;potential solution;pots;product;product delivery;production;production method;raw;raw material;reductions;resilient;resilient food;resource;resource depletion;resourceefficient;resourceefficient step;result suggest;results;scenarios;soil;solution;solutions;steps;stockholm;studies;study;suggest;sustainability;sweden;symbiotic exchange;system;systems;transportation;understand;urban environment;urban farming;urban waste;vertical farming;vertical hydroponic;wastes,assessment;environmental assessment;hydroponic;hydroponic farming;sweden;system;vertical hydroponic,78

This paper aims to (1) identify the ""triggers"" for novelty production in UA; (2) characterize the different kinds of novelties applied in UA; (3) evaluate the ""innovativeness"" of those social, environmental and economic novelties; and, (4) estimate the links between novelties and sustainability. The study was based on the evaluation of 11 case studies in fourWestern European countries (Italy, Germany, France and Spain). The results show that the trigger and origin of new activities can often be traced back to specific problems that initiators were intended to address or solve. In total, we found 147 novelties produced in the 11 case studies. More novelties are produced in the environmental and social dimensions of sustainability than in the economic. In most cases, external stakeholders played an important role in supporting the projects.

This paper attempts to design and build an intelligent outdoor aquaponics system with automated grow lights and internet of things. Depending on the ambient light intensity, the grow lights automatically turn on or off, which reduce electricity consumption while ensuring adequate light intensity for plant growth. Furthermore, the system condition is continuously monitored, and the system operation is automatically controlled by means of interconnected sensors unit, actuators unit, alerts and notifications unit, central control and processing unit, and graphical user interfaces for web and desktop applications. Any abnormal condition will trigger an early warning to the user and activate respective actuator for rectification with minimum human intervention, which ensures a healthy environment for growing plants and fish, as evidenced in regression analyses. In addition, sensor data are sent to the Google cloud platform for easy storage, analysis, and visualisation. A secure login feature is also included in the system to strengthen cybersecurity.

Those approaches are still at an early stage of development and partly unknown among the public. The aim of our study was to identify the perception of sustainability, social acceptability and ethical aspects of these new approaches and products in urban food production. We conducted 19 qualitative expert interviews and applied qualitative content analysis. Our results revealed that major perceived benefits are educational effects, revaluation of city districts, efficient resource use, exploitation of new protein sources or strengthening of local economies. Major perceived conflicts concern negative side-effects, legal constraints or high investment costs. The extracted acceptance factors deal significantly with the ""unknown"". A lack of understanding of the new approaches, uncertainty about their benefits, concerns about health risks, a lack of familiarity with the food products, and ethical doubts about animal welfare represent possible barriers. We conclude that adaptation of the unsuitable regulatory framework, which discourages investors, is an important first step to foster dissemination of the urban food production approaches",acceptance;indoor farming;insect eating;micro-algae;novel food;rooftop greenhouses;sustainability;urban farming,animal welfare;cropping practice;edible species;farming system;food chain;greenhouse ecosystem;insect;investment incentive;microalga;roof;urban planning;urban region;urbanization;algae;animalia;hexapoda,"Specht, K.; ILS-Research Institute for Regional and Urban DevelopmentGermany; email: kathrin.specht@ils-forschung.de",,MDPI AG,20711050,,,,English,Sustainability,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85070771788,6,Germany,Germany,ils-research institute for regional and urban development;department of agricultural economics;leibniz centre for agricultural landscape research (zalf);albrecht daniel thaer-institute of agricultural and horticultural sciences;technische universitat berlin,ils-research institute for regional and urban development,acceptability;acceptance;acceptance factor;adaptation;aim;analysis;animal;animal welfare;approaches;aquaponics;aspects;barriers;benefits;chains;challenges;change;city;city district;climate;climate change;concern;concerns;conclude;conflict concern;conflicts;constraints;content;content analysis;costs;deal;development;discourages;dissemination;districts;doubts;early stage;economies;edible insect;educational effect;effects;efficient;efficient resource;ethical aspect;ethical doubt;expert;expert interview;exploitation;factor deal;factors;familiarity;farms;first step;food;food chain;food product;food production;foster;foster dissemination;framework;global challenge;greenhouses;health;health risk;high investment;indoor;indoor farms;innovative urban;insects;interviews;investment;investment cost;investors;lack;legal constraint;local economy;microalgae;negative sideeffects;new approach;new protein;perception;possible barrier;production;production approach;production site;products;protein;protein source;public;qualitative;qualitative content;qualitative expert;regulatory framework;represent;resource;resource use;results;revaluation;risks;rooftop;rooftop greenhouse;sideeffects;sites;social acceptability;sources;stage;step;study;sustainability;transparency;uncertainty;urban food;urbanization;use;vertical farms;welfare;welfare represent,acceptability;approaches;cities;eat;edible insect;farminga;farminga study;future;insects;new approach;perception;produce;study;vertical farminga,81

Food literacy (FL) has been described as a promising approach to reconnect the city with the country and furthermore address public health issues such as obesity and diet-related disease. The present study examined urban gardening through the lens of the FL approach to determine whether a relationship exists between gardening and FL. The research further investigated the relationship between FL and gardener demographics, participation in educational garden events and socialization among gardeners. Data was collected using an online questionnaire targeted to reach community gardeners (n = 181) in Minneapolis and Saint Paul, Minnesota. The research utilized a novel exam and self-perception based measurement tool to assess gardeners' level of FL. Results indicated a moderately positive relationship between the years of gardening experience and higher individual FL scores. Participants with higher levels of FL were older individuals and more highly educated. There was no significant difference in FL between gardeners who attended educational events and those that had not.

However, there is a lack of academic literature regarding the thermodynamic potential of interior urban agriculture. Furthermore, there is always a need to develop, from scratch, an updated methodological approach that aims to assist architects of conceiving such specific thermodynamically complex interior environments. In this paper, urban space is identified as a 'flow system', and Bejan's constructal law of generation of flow structure is used to morph and discover the system flow architecture that offers greater global performance (greater access to what flows). More precisely, a macroscale thermodynamic model of spherical urban greenhouse form with double thermal envelope has been developed while the methodological approach resulted in the definition of a decisional flowchart that can be reproduced by other researchers. On the basis of this macroscale constructal model, the present paper proposes reduced models that link thermodynamic and geometric parameters in an accurate manner and can be used at early design stages for pedagogic and qualitative optimization purposes, integrating urban farming to architectural programming",applied thermal engineering;architectural eco-conception;architecture;bioclimatic design;building physics;constructal law;heat transfer;sustainable design;thermodynamic optimization;urban agriculture,architecture;bioclimatology;design method;engineering;greenspace;heat flux;heat transfer;numerical model;optimization;thermodynamics;urban agriculture;urban climate;urban ecosystem,"Mavromatidis, L.; ICube UMR 7357, School of Architecture, Universite de Strasbourg, INSA Strasbourg, 24 Boulevard de la Victoire, France; email: lazaros.mavromatidis@insa-strasbourg.fr",,MDPI AG,20711050,,,,English,Sustainability,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85069432049,1,France,France,school of architecture,school of architecture,academic literature;access;accurate;accurate manner;agriculture;aims;approach;architects;architectural programming;architecture;assist;assist architect;basis;bejans;change;cities;city resilience;climate;climate change;complex interior;constructal;constructal law;constructal model;decisional;decisional flowchart;definition;design;design stage;developed;discover;envelope;environments;flow;flow architecture;flow structure;flow system;flowchart;flows;form;friendly practice;generation;geometric;geometric parameter;global performance;greenhouse;greenhouse form;interior;interior environment;lack;law;link;link thermodynamic;literature;macroscale;macroscale constructal;macroscale thermodynamic;manner;methodological approach;model;models;morph;need;offers;optimization;optimization purpose;paper;paper proposes;parameters;pedagogic;performance;practice;present;present paper;proposes;purposes;qualitative;qualitative optimization;researchers;resilience;scratch;space;spherical urban;stages;strengthen;strengthen city;structure;system;system flow;thermal;thermal envelope;thermodynamic model;thermodynamic potential;updated methodological;urban agriculture;urban farming;urban greenhouse;urban space,constructal;constructal macroscale;currents;envelope;form;greenhouse;greenhouse form;heat;macroscale;macroscale thermodynamic;model;spherical urban;thermal;thermal envelope;thermodynamic model;urban greenhouse,86

Urban gardening is a common practice in many industrialised and developing countries. The ability of urban vegetable gardens to support biodiversity, however, has yet to be studied in depth. To investigate the responses of flora and soil fauna to urbanization, we surveyed the taxonomic and functional composition of plant and collembolan communities, in addition to soil parameters, in 15 urban vegetable gardens across three large French cities. The vegetation was identified in six plots of 1 × 1 m in each urban vegetable garden and collembolan were extracted from one intact soil core sampled in the center of each plot (5 cm depth, 6 cm diameter). We found contrasting effects of urbanization on plants and Collembola biodiversity. The taxonomic and functional composition of the soil fauna was more similar within cities than among cities, which was driven by similarities in soil parameters. In contrast, plant communities were functionally similar among cities. Understanding the effects of urbanization on soil biodiversity could have implications for the management of urban ecosystems, in particular that of urban soils",functional diversity;functional trait;plant community;soil biodiversity;urban biodiversity conservation;urban soil,,"Joimel, S.; UMR ECOSYS, INRA, AgroParisTech, Universite Paris-SaclayFrance; email: sophie.boulanger-joimel@inra.fr",,Springer New York LLC,10838155,,,,English,Urban Ecosyst,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85065507207,7,France;Germany,France,universite paris-saclay;umr laboratoire sols et environnement;department of biology;centre d’ecologie et des sciences de la conservation;universite paul-valery montpellier 3,universite paris-saclay,ability;addition;areas;biodiversity;biotic homogenization;center;challenges;cities;cm;cm depth;cm diameter;collembola;collembola biodiversity;collembolan;collembolan community;common practice;communities;composition;conservation;contrast;core;countries;depth;diameter;driven;ecosystems;effects;fauna;flora;foremost;foremost challenge;found;french city;functional composition;garden;gardening;gardens;green area;homogenization;implications;intact soil;investigate;management;parameters;plant;plant community;plants;plot;plot cm;plots;practice;responses;similarities;soil;soil biodiversity;soil core;soil fauna;soil parameter;soils;support;support biodiversity;urban ecosystem;urban gardening;urban soil;urban vegetable;urbanization;vegetable;vegetable garden;vegetation;×,collembolan;collembolan community;communities;gardens;homogenization;homogenization pattern;patterns;plant;urban vegetable;vegetable;vegetable garden,87

Urban agriculture (UA) is advocated by some as a multi-faceted approach to help achieve urban sustainability goals as it provides possible social, economic and environmental benefits. The role of UA in restoring resource cycles receives increasing attention, especially with regard to assimilating urban waste. However, there is little information on how nutrients are managed in UA in industrialized countries. To examine nutrient management in UA, data was collected from a total of 25 ground-based UA initiatives in the Netherlands on i) preferences for types of fertilizers, and ii) quantity and quality of fertilizers used including nutrient composition and organic matter content. The main inputs at urban farms were compost and manure, high in organic matter content. The total nutrient inputs were compared to nutrient demand, based on crop nutrient uptake, in order to determine nutrient balances. Results show that mean nutrient inputs exceeded mean crop demand by roughly 450% for total nitrogen, 600% for phosphorus and 250% for potassium. Mean inputs for plant-available nitrogen were comparable to crop uptake values. The surpluses, particularly for phosphorus, are higher than fertilizer application limits used for conventional farming in The Netherlands. While nutrient input calculations were subject to several uncertainties, e.g., due to lack of accuracy of the data supplied by the farmers, results show a salient indication of over-fertilization and thus a suboptimal nutrient use. If UA continues to expand across cities these observed nutrient surpluses may pose a risk for local surface waters and groundwater as well as soil quality. The need to improve nutrient management in UA is evident. Soil tests, harvest logging and book keeping of nutrient inputs would improve data quality and may help balance nutrient inputs with nutrient outputs",fertilizer use;nitrogen;organic matter;phosphorus;potassium;urban farming,biogeochemistry;biological materials;composting;crops;groundwater;nitrogen;nitrogen fertilizers;organic compounds;phosphorus;potassium;soil testing;sustainable development;economic and environmental benefits;fertilizer applications;fertilizer use;industrialized countries;multi-faceted approach;organic matter content;plant available nitrogens;urban farming;nutrients;fertilizer;ground water;nitrogen;organic matter;phosphorus;potassium;surface water;farming system;fertilizer application;management practice;nitrogen;nutrient;organic matter;phosphorus;potassium;urban agriculture;agricultural procedures;article;compost;fertilizer application;harvest;manure;netherlands;nutrient content;nutrient management;nutrient uptake;priority journal;qualitative analysis;quality control;quantitative analysis;soil analysis;soil quality;urban area;netherlands,"Weijma, J.P.O.

Historically, European allotments can be seen as a product of urbanisation. At the same time, they embody a number of ""non-urban"" characteristics that create the impression of ""the countryside in the city"". This research project investigates how the urban and the rural are materialised, represented and practised in five allotment sites in Brno, Czech Republic. We follow three main lines of enquiry where the urban and the rural seem to meet: The physical environment of the allotments; the social life of these spaces; and food production as one of their core functions. Critical reflection of the rural-urban perspective advances our understanding of urban gardens, while, at the same time, allotments offer an example of hybrid spaces, which, in turn, contribute to discussions on current cities and countrysides.

In some parts of the world its main function is to feed the rapidly growing population while in others it is more associated with lifestyle and environmental issues. Undeniably, UA provides opportunities for sustainable city development. UA can support all pillars of sustainable development: ecological, economic, and social. However, depending on existing circumstances certain pillars may be influenced more than others. In this paper we concentrate on urban allotments in Andalusia and take Baeza as an example of a city with an interesting approach to urban gardening. We attempt to answer the question how urban allotments in Baeza affect the city's sustainable development and what remains to be done to make this influence more effective. Our study showed that allotment gardens in Baeza endorsed all three pillars of sustainable city development. However, developing broader community relations on the city scale, revival of declining local grocery market and dissemination of environmental initiatives which allotment gardens may also promote and facilitate was missing",allotment gardens;andalusia;spain;sustainable development;urban agriculture,environmental issue;garden;population growth;sustainability;sustainable development;urban agriculture;urban development;andalucia;spain,,,Sciendo,0137477X,,,,English,Quaest Geogr,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85065984494,3,Poland;Spain,Poland,institute of socio-economic geography and spatial management;department of geography;department of cartographic,institute of socio-economic geography and spatial management,affect;agriculture;agriculture ua;allotment;allotment garden;allotments;andalusia;answer;approach;attempt;baeza;baeza affect;broader;certain pillar;circumstances;city;city development;city scale;city sustainable;citys;community;community relation;concentrate;demand;development;dissemination;environmental initiative;environmental issue;example;facilitate;feed;function;gardening;gardens;global phenomenon;grocery;grocery market;influence;initiatives;interesting approach;issues;lifestyle;local grocery;main function;market;opportunities;others;paper;parts;phenomenon;pillars;population;promote;question;relations;remains;revival;scale;study;support;sustainable city;sustainable development;ua;urban agriculture;urban allotment;urban gardening;world,agriculture;allotment;allotment garden;andalusia;city;city development;development;gardens;insights;path;sustainable city;urban agriculture,91

While environmental justice discourse considers the unequal effects of environmental burdens, the language that frames “sustainability” is often socially and politically neutral. This paper critically examines the sustainability initiatives and practices of urban farming program in Florida. Based on ethnographic fieldwork in 2017, it explores the extent to which these initiatives consider a community's race and socioeconomic class when working to provide sustainably grown food in diverse communities. We argue that the program's initiatives overlook food justice concerns and use the same approach across disparate communities that focus on environmental rather than community benefits. Therefore, the program's non-political approach neglects to integrate the experiences of those living on the margins. This research calls for a critical examination of sustainability practices, and the incorporation of social justice themes into sustainability agendas",environmental justice;florida;food and environmental sustainability;political ecology;social justice;urban anthropology,,,,Wiley Blackwell,21539553,,,,English,Cult Agric Food Environ,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85061562636,2,United States,United States,department of anthropology;department of anthropology,department of anthropology,1960s;agendas;approach;approach neglect;argue;benefits;burdens;calls;class;communities;community;community benefit;community race;communitys;concerns;considers;critical examination;discourse;discourse considers;discourses;disparate;disparate community;diverse;diverse community;effects;environmental burden;environmental justice;environmental movement;ethnographic fieldwork;examination;examines;experiences;explores;extent;fieldwork;florida;focus;food;food justice;forefront;frame “sustainability”;frames;grown;incorporation;initiative consider;initiative overlook;initiatives;integrate;justice;justice concern;justice discourse;justice theme;language;living;margins;momentum;movement;neglects;nonpolitical approach;overlook;overlook food;paper;practices;program;program initiative;programs;provide;race;research;research call;s;social justice;socioeconomic class;sustainability;sustainability agenda;sustainability initiative;sustainability practice;themes;u;unequal effect;urban farming;use;“sustainability”,agenda;analysis;community;environmental sustainability;food;food justice;justice;program food;programs;sustainability;sustainability agenda,92

How and why has this form of welfare provision emerged as an urban institution, and what affects whether it endures? This article compares projects to grant poor and unemployed Chicagoans access to land for gardens and small farms between 1895 and 1935, explaining how this form of social support came about through experiments with rules, norms, and forms of property. While social policy is typically understood as emerging through the realization of rights to public support, use-based welfare turns instead on efforts to create a legal privilege for the needy to use idle resources. During the Progressive Era and the Great Depression, this form of relief was pitched as both an alternative and a complement to welfare based on tax and transfer. Yet efforts to establish it as a permanent institution repeatedly failed, due to implementation challenges, opposition from people committed to treating land and food as commodities, and the nonemergence of a social movement to defend land access.

After a background discussion of the spatial and environmental injustice theory and an assessment of methodologies that have been adopted in relevant studies, we will highlight existing links with urban gardening initiatives in a specific case study, i.e. the city of Rome, Italy. The case study is introduced to investigate the spatial coincidence of urban gardening initiatives in this specific city (assumed as the dependent variable) and spatial and environmental injustice (S&EI) indicators. Several S&EI-related phenomena whose relevance has been demonstrated are mapped, and their goodness of fit in serving as explanatory variables for the spatial distribution of urban gardening agency is investigated. The analysis builds upon a quantitative approach and features a linear spatial regression model. Surprisingly, findings suggest that social-economic variables generally have greater influence on spatial injustice than environmental variables. In fact, from a theoretical perspective, our results challenge the current interpretation of urban gardening as a mere means to address environmental, food or nature-related issues in cities. Instead, they support the increasingly popular interpretation of urban gardening as a political gesture. Our results provide policy-makers with useful observations about key variables related to spatial injustice in the city and contrasting initiatives, notably urban gardening projects.

The objective of this study was to produce fruit and vegetable containers using particleboards made from mulberry tree pruning waste and to evaluate their properties. Mulberry particleboards were made and their mechanical properties were tested to demonstrate their suitability for industrial uses. Afterwards, the containersmadewithmulberry particleboardswere tested. The strength of the containers was less than 5000 kg to dynamic compressive strength. Deformation by stacking was 3.15 mm, which is less than the maximum allowed of 6.1 mm, and flexural deformation of the base was 2 mm",containers;mechanical properties;particleboards;waste recovery,,"Ferrandez-Villena, M.; Department. of Engineering, Universidad Miguel HernandezSpain; email: m.ferrandez@umh.es",,MDPI AG,20763417,,,,English,Appl Sci,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85067207999,5,Spain,Spain,department. of engineering,department. of engineering,afterwards;aim;alba;alba l;base;compressive;compressive strength;containers;containersmadewithmulberry;current research;deformation;demonstrate;dynamic compressive;effort aim;efforts;evaluate;flexural deformation;forests;fruit;gardening;kg;l;material;material source;maximum;mechanical property;mm;morus;morus alba;mulberry;mulberry particleboards;mulberry tree;objective;ornamental;particleboards;pressure;produce;produce fruit;properties;research;research effort;sent;shade;shade tree;sources;spain;strength;study;suitability;tip;tree;tree morus;trees;urban gardening;uses;vegetable;vegetable container;waste;year,alba;alba l;containers;evaluation;fruit;l;morus;morus alba;mulberry;mulberry wood;vegetable;vegetable container;waste;wood;wood morus,99

As of today, our knowledge about the influence of population characteristics and local habits of garden use on risk estimates is incomplete. This work studies the effect of the variability of local exposure factors on the output of a risk assessment in an urban garden scenario through a probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) and an uncertainty analysis. A total of 24 soil samples and 23 samples of lettuce were collected in six urban gardens. Trace element concentration were analysed in both matrices with an atomic absorption spectrometer. Relevant exposure factors were characterized by onsite and online surveys. The results showed that the use of widely accepted, default exposure values overestimate the risk when compared with the result of an assessment with local information. In this study, the 95th percentile of the risk distribution did not exceed human health unacceptability thresholds. Exposure frequency and vegetable consumption rates were the variables to which the risk outcome was most sensitive.

Trees and shrubs, as a key component of agroecosystems, provide ecosystem services that support food security and agricultural productivity. However, the relationship between landscape structure, land use intensification, species diversity and functional diversity of woody plant communities particularly within the semi-arid environment of West Africa has received little attention. We combined GIS analyses and field sampling of woody plant communities of 72 agricultural systems located in rural, peri-urban and urban areas of Tamale (Ghana) and Ouagadougou (Burkina Faso). From a landscape perspective, peri-urban systems in Ouagadougou formed a transition or interacting zone between rural and urban systems and were shaped by urban growth dynamics whereas in Tamale peri-urban systems constituted a simplification of the rural parkland habitats and was mainly determined by agricultural intensification. Woody plant communities showed a high functional richness along the rural-urban gradient and provided a variety of ecosystem services, with food provisioning as main good. A trade-off between two regulating services, bio-control of pests and pollination services, could be observed within urban and in part within peri-urban farming systems. Hence, obtaining a holistic understanding of how landscape structure that is shaped by city growth and agricultural intensification affects ecosystem services is fundamental if West African urban farmers are to be politically supported in their efforts to manage landscapes effectively and to ensure agro-ecosystem multi-functionality and productivity",landscape composition and configuration;species’ function;sub-saharan cities;urban agroecology,,"Stenchly, K.; Organic Plant Production and Agroecosystems Research in the Tropics and Subtropics (OPATS), Universitat Kassel, Steinstrasse 19, Germany; email: stenchly@uni-kassel.de",,Springer New York LLC,10838155,,,,English,Urban Ecosyst,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85055865745,5,Ghana;Germany;Burkina Faso,Germany,universitat kassel;laboratoire central d’entomologie agricole de kamboinse;Immenstaad;department of horticulture,universitat kassel,affect ecosystem;affects;africa;african urban;agricultural intensification;agricultural production;agricultural productivity;agricultural system;agroecosystem;agroecosystem multifunctionality;agroecosystems;analyses;areas;attention;biocontrol;burkina;burkina faso;changes;city;city growth;communities;component;composition;configuration;diversity;dynamic whereas;dynamics;ecosystem;ecosystem service;efforts;environment;establishment;farmers;faso;field;food;food provisioning;food security;functional diversity;functional richness;ghana;gi analysis;gis;gradient;growth;habitats;hence;high functional;high urbanization;holistic understanding;intensification;intensification affect;key;key component;land;land use;landscape;landscape perspective;landscape structure;landscapes;little attention;manage;manage landscape;multifunctionality;ouagadougou;ouagadougou burkina;parkland;parkland habitat;part;periurban;periurban farming;periurban system;perspective;pests;plant;plant community;pollination;pollination service;pressure;production;production system;productivity;provide;provide ecosystem;relationship;richness;rural parkland;ruralurban;ruralurban gradient;security;semiarid;semiarid environment;services;shrubs;simplification;specie diversity;species;structure;subsaharan;subsaharan africa;support;support food;systems;tamale;tamale ghana;tamale periurban;tradeoff;transition;trees;urban area;urban farmer;urban farming;urban growth;urban system;urbanization;urbanization pressure;use;use intensification;variety;west;west africa;whereas;woody;woody plant;zone,african city;agricultural system;changes;cities;communities;ecosystem;ecosystem service;landscape;landscape change;periurban;plant;plant community;relations;services;structural landscape;systems;west;woody;woody plant,102

This paper analyses consumer concern about food safety and its determinants, taking into account spatial disparities. Using the mixed method which combines data from our consumer survey and group discussions in Hanoi, we found that consumers experienced a high level of anxiety about food safety. In their eyes, pesticide residues, food preservatives, and hormone in livestock were top three risky hazards. As a result, vegetables, fruits, and meat were considered to be most unsafe. The concern about food safety was shaped by the fear of food hazards, risk perception of protein food, risk perception of vegetables and fruits, food risk information acquisition, and region. Region was the most important determinant of food safety concern, suggesting that spatial disparities exist. With a limited capacity to self-supply food and weaker social and kinship networks, urban consumers perceived a lower level of control over food safety. Their level of worry about food safety, therefore, was higher than their rural counterparts. Hence, urban farming is important, as it will help reduce urban consumers’ distress about food safety.

However, the influences of urban green space management on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning (BEF) relationships is poorly understood. We investigated the relationship between soil fauna and litter decomposition in 170 urban garden sites along a gradient of urbanisation intensity in the city of Zurich, CH. We used litter bags of 1 and 4 mm mesh size to evaluate the contribution of soil meso- and macrofauna on litter decomposition. By using multilevel structural equation models (SEM), we investigated direct and indirect environmental effects and management practices on litter decomposition and litter residue quality. We evaluated the role of taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic diversity of soil fauna species on litter decomposition, based on a sample of 120 species (81,007 individuals; 39 collembola, 18 earthworm, 16 isopod, 47 gastropod species). We found highest litter decomposition rates using 4 mm mesh size litter bags, highlighting the importance of soil macrofauna. Urban warming, a proxy for urbanisation intensity, covaried positively, whereas soil disturbances, such as intensive soil and crop management, were negatively correlated with decomposition rates. Interestingly, soil fauna species richness decreased, with the exception of gastropods, and soil fauna abundance increased with urban warming. Our data also show that plant species richness positively affected litter decomposition by increasing soil fauna species richness and microbial activity. A multivariate analysis of organic compounds in litter residues confirmed the importance of soil fauna species richness and garden management on litter decomposition processes. Overall, we showed, that also in intensively managed urban green spaces, such as gardens, biodiversity of plants and soil fauna drives key ecosystem processes.

The aim of the article is to present the possibilities for accomplishment of idea of reclaiming urban space through its taming, on the example of the competition designs of town greenery in different scales in two Polish cities: Szczecin and Zlotow. The idea of taming the urban space was interpreted as integrated action of three components: - urban gardening - through appropriately chosen plant species, including edible plants and use of traditional and elevated plant beds the space created is ""homely"", ""safe"", creating connotations with a home garden, stimulating interaction of neighbours and the feeling of being the ""host"" of the space; - games in the space - the use of some amusement elements and adaptation of the urban elements of small architecture and the surfaces to the needs of games and recreation, but without being too literal in that aspect, to be used by all inhabitants, independently from their age, introduces the feeling of freedom, creativity and even surprise that accompany entertainment, to the space and in effect enhances the integrative quality of the space and the feeling of comfort of staying ""in our own"", that is neighbourly space; - system of easily adaptable furniture - thanks to furniture elements that give the inhabitants the possibility to transform the space we enhance their awareness of their real influence on the functioning of the space and its perception as an attractive one, because it can be used according to one's individual needs.

Presented considerations are based on field studies carried out by the author, supplemented by photographic documentation, and the analysis of available iconographic materials and literature. The research covered areas ""reclaimed by nature"" and included in the structure of selected European cities. Discovering (by planners) the potential inherent in these areas, both natural and cultural, brought a number of excellent spatial and functional solutions. We find examples of such solutions in the spaces of many European cities. These are, for example, parks created in the former railway areas of Berlin; in Madrid, the reconstruction of the city ring road, which allowed for the reclaiming of the areas on the Manzanares River and the creation of a several-kilometre long park on the waterfront. It became commonplace (especially in large cities) that space for green areas is created on roofs and walls of buildings, and more and more often, in small undeveloped areas where Packet Parks are created. At the end of the 20th century, a phenomenon known as ""urban gardening"" emerged very clearly in the spaces of cities. As a result of socio-ecological initiatives in various parts of the urban structures, also social gardens are created. These vary in terms of size and are diversified in terms of the spatial and functional solutions applied. The analysed natural spaces are places of rest, relaxation, but also educational and cultural events; they are included in the green structure of cities and they become their integral part. Clearly visible is also significant participation of local communities in creating these spaces and taking responsibility for their use. Presented examples indicate a clear change in thinking about the role of green areas in urban space and the benefits it can give to city dwellers. The positive social, ecological, spatial, functional and compositional effects obtained in these projects may be an inspiration to create non-standard solutions for transformations of other urban structures",,ecology;compositional effects;cultural events;functional solution;green structures;presented examples;socio-ecological;standard solutions;undeveloped areas;urban planning,"Nowacka-Rejzner, U.; Institute of Cities and Regions Planning, Faculty of Architecture, Cracow University of Technology, Warszawska24'St, Poland; email: nowacka.rejzner@gmail.com",Marschalko M.Yilmaz I.Decky M.Drusa M.Rybak J.Segalini A.Dabija A.-M.Coisson E.,Institute of Physics Publishing,17578981,,,,English,IOP Conf Ser Mater Sci Eng,Conference Paper,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85062401750,1,Poland,Poland,institute of cities and regions planning,institute of cities and regions planning,20th century;aim;analysis;answer;areas;author;become;benefits;berlin;brought;buildings;century;change;cities;city;city dweller;city ring;clear change;commonplace;communities;compositional effect;considerations;create;create nonstandard;creation;cultural event;documentation;dwellers;effects;end;european city;events;example;example indicate;examples;excellent;excellent spatial;field;field study;former railway;functional solution;gardening;gardens;green area;green structure;iconographic material;indicate;inherent;initiatives;inspiration;integral part;large city;literature;local community;madrid;manzanares;materials;modern city;natural space;nature;nonstandard solution;number;packet;packet park;park;parks;part;participation;parts;phenomenon;photographic documentation;place;places;planners;potential inherent;projects;question;railway;railway area;reconstruction;relaxation;research;responsibility;rest;result;ring;river;road;role;roofs;severalkilometre;significant participation;size;social garden;socioecological initiative;solutions;space;spaces;structure;structures;studies;terms;transformations;undeveloped area;urban gardening;urban space;urban structure;use;various part;vary;walls;waterfront;work,areas;city;green area;modern city;places;spaces,110

The search for methods for the broadly understood integration in space proves necessary, and even the precondition for harmonious development and the effective functioning of a community. Integration of architecture and landscape can be understood and interpreted spatially in different ways. It is pursued not only through references to organic shapes, but also through the use of the site context in order to blend the architecture with its surroundings, to make references to historical and cultural motifs, the use of which allows people to create spaces that are functionally and narratively coherent, to ""domesticate» the space by introducing the idea of agrarian urbanism, urban gardening and agriculture into the urbanised space, combining ecological solutions with art, allowing the passing time for a slow but permanent blurring of differences between cultural and natural elements, as well as using symbolism and philosophy. The purpose of this article is: to show the possibility of interpreting the integration of architecture and landscape and to introduce its new definition based on literature studies and analysis of selected architectural projects; to analyse and evaluate two selected examples of development concepts in the context of the adopted original definition of the integration of architecture and landscape (as a synergy of spatial factors); to identify the universal factors (actions) whose synergistic function contributes to the integration of architecture and landscape. These objectives are pursued based on the bibliographical analysis (interpretative studies) and axiological studies (including studies of source materials and field observations) of the two selected development concepts.

A dimmable LED driver is needed to drive LEDs for a horticulture grow light. The LCC topology is chosen because of its capability to operate in open loop as a constant current source. It can operate at its natural resonant frequency to deliver a constant current independent of the load, simplifying the circuit requirements. Operating in that frequency will also give the advantage of soft switching, letting the converter operate at high efficiencies and reduces EMI. The constructed prototype validates the operation of this converter in this mode while being able to implement PWM dimming. The response time also shows a very good transition during the on and off intervals of the dimming circuit",current source;lcc;led driver;resonant converter,agriculture;natural frequencies;power converters;constant current;constant current source;current sources;lcc resonant converter;led drivers;open-loop;pwm dimming;resonant converters;light emitting diodes,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,21593442,9781538654576,85QXA,,English,IEEE Reg 10 Annu Int Conf Proc TENCON,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85063213715,2,Philippines,Philippines,electrical and electronics engineering institute,electrical and electronics engineering institute,advantage;application;applications;capability;chosen;circuit;circuit requirement;converter;converter operate;current source;deliver;drive;driver;efficiencies;emi;frequency;good transition;grow;grow light;high efficiency;horticulture;horticulture grow;implement;implement pwm;intervals;lcc;lcc resonant;lcc topology;leds;light;load;loop;mode;natural resonant;open loop;operate;operating;operation;paper;paper present;presents;prototype;prototype validates;pwm;reduces;requirements;resonant;resonant converter;resonant frequency;response;response time;shows;soft switching;source;time;topology;transition;urban farming;validates,dimmable openloop;driver;grow;grow light;horticulture;horticulture grow;light;openloop;openloop resonant;resonant,112

The recently evolved concept of an ""urban commons"" responds to the crucial need to re-situate residents as key actors. Urban food commons summarize all initiatives that are food-related (e.g., cultivation, harvest, and distribution), aiming at a visualization and utilization of value chains and the commons-based linkage between them. We explored first insights of food commons in Berlin based on semi-structured, in-depth interviews. Urban food commons strengthen identification, participation, self-organization, and social resilience, are steered by bottom-up processes, and can be a powerful tool for a transformation towards urban sustainability. However, a viable political integration of existing initiatives lacks due to structural implementation problems. Respondents recommend a pooling of all initiatives in a strong network and a mediation interface to coordinate between food commons and city administration and politics.

First, we show that global integrated assessment models which characterise transformation pathways consistent with 1.5 °C mitigation are limited in their ability to analyse the emergence of novelty in energy end-use. Second, we introduce concepts of disruptive innovation which can be usefully applied to the challenge of 1.5 °C mitigation. Disruptive low-carbon innovations offer novel value propositions to consumers and can transform markets for energy-related goods and services while reducing emissions. Third, we identify 99 potentially disruptive low-carbon innovations relating to mobility, food, buildings and cities, and energy supply and distribution. Examples at the fringes of current markets include car clubs, mobility-as-a-service, prefabricated high-efficiency retrofits, internet of things, and urban farming. Each of these offers an alternative to mainstream consumer practices. Fourth, we assess the potential emission reductions from subsets of these disruptive low-carbon innovations using two methods: a survey eliciting experts’ perceptions and a quantitative scaling-up of evidence from early-adopting niches to matched segments of the UK population. We conclude that disruptive low-carbon innovations which appeal to consumers can help efforts to limit warming to 1.5 °C",consumers;energy end-use;innovation;mitigation,commerce;emission control;climate mitigations;consumers;disruptive innovations;end-uses;global integrated assessments;mitigation;reducing emissions;transformation pathways;carbon;consumption behavior;emission control;energy use;global warming;innovation;mitigation;united kingdom,"Wilson, C.; Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research, University of East AngliaUnited Kingdom; email: charlie.wilson@uea.ac.uk",,Springer Netherlands,1570646X,,,,English,Energy Effic,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85047198289,5,United Kingdom;Austria,United Kingdom,tyndall centre for climate change research;international institute for applied systems analysis,tyndall centre for climate change research,ability;alternative;analyse;appeal;assess;assessment;assessment model;buildings;car;car club;challenge;characterise;characterise transformation;cities;clubs;concepts;conclude;consistent;consumer;consumer practice;consumers;contribute;contribute emission;current market;disruptive;disruptive innovation;disruptive lowcarbon;distribution;efforts;emergence;emission;emission reduction;emissions;enduse;energy;energy enduse;energy supply;evidence;examples;experts’;food;fringes;goods;help;help effort;highefficiency;highefficiency retrofit;include;include car;innovation;innovation offer;innovations;internet;introduce;introduce concept;investigates;limit;lowcarbon;lowcarbon innovation;mainstream;mainstream consumer;markets;methods;mitigation;mobility;mobilityasaservice;models;niches;novel;novel value;novelty;offer;offer novel;offers;paper;paper investigates;pathways;perceptions;population;potential emission;practices;propositions;quantitative;quantitative scalingup;reductions;retrofits;scalingup;segments;services;show;subsets;supply;survey;things;transform;transform market;transformation;transformation pathway;uk;uk population;urban farming;value;value proposition;°c,climate;climate mitigation;contribution;disruptive;disruptive lowcarbon;innovations;lowcarbon;lowcarbon innovation;mitigation;potential contribution;°c;°c climate,116

In this study, it was hypothesized that vegetable farming contributes significantly to the livelihood of farmers by generating cash and providing employment opportunities. The relationship between livelihood and vegetable farming based on the practices, views, and perceptions of vegetable farmers at four different sites in the outskirts of KV was studied. A purposive sample of 140 farm households was surveyed, and key informant interviews were conducted to collect comprehensive data. Binary logistic regression was used to identify the relationships between farmer livelihood and numerous variables related to vegetable farming. It was found that the most of the surveyed farmers are migrants who have spread to different corners of KV at different times. The surveyed farmers cultivate an average area of 2551.5 m 2 for vegetable farming. The major vegetable products in the study area are tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), carrot (Daucus carota), and green leafy vegetables. The model results indicate a significant positive relationship between vegetable farming and livelihood. The survey results also reveal many constraints (e.g., poor market management and lack of irrigation facilities) and challenges (e.g., haphazard urban growth, price fluctuation, and vegetable diseases). Since vegetable farming has become a major source of livelihood for farmers in the peripheral areas of KV, further interventions should be implemented to strengthen the vegetable sector and sustain this source of livelihood for peri-urban farmers",binary logistic regression;farmers' perception;kathmandu valley;peri-urban farming;vegetable marketing,agricultural practice;crop plant;economic activity;employment;farming system;leafy vegetable;market conditions;marketing;perception;periurban area;questionnaire survey;regression analysis;kathmandu valley;nepal;daucus carota;lycopersicon esculentum,"Paudel, B.; Key Laboratory of Land Surface Pattern and Simulation, Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of SciencesChina; email: paudelb@igsnrr.ac.cn",,MDPI AG,20711050,,,,English,Sustainability,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85061340511,6,Nepal;China,Nepal,central department of geography;institute of geographic sciences and natural resources research;cas center for excellence in tibetan plateau earth sciences;kathmandu center for research and education;university of chinese academy of sciences,central department of geography,activity;agricultural practice;agriculture;area;areas;average area;become;binary;binary logistic;carota;carrot;carrot daucus;cash;challenge e;challenges;collect;collect comprehensive;comprehensive;comprehensive data;constraint e;constraints;contributes;corners;cultivate;data;daucus;daucus carota;different corner;different site;different time;diseases;e;economic activity;employment;employment opportunity;facilities;farm;farm household;farmer;farmer cultivate;farmer livelihood;farmers;fluctuation;found;g;green leafy;growth;haphazard;haphazard urban;households;indicate;informant;informant interview;interventions;interviews;irrigation;irrigation facility;kathmandu;key;key informant;kv;lack;leafy;leafy vegetable;livelihood;logistic regression;lycopersicum;major source;major vegetable;management;many constraint;market;market management;migrants;model;model result;numerous variable;opportunities;outskirts;perceptions;peripheral area;periurban;periurban farmer;poor market;positive relationship;practices;price;price fluctuation;products;purposive;purposive sample;regression;relationship;relationships;result indicate;results;reveal;sample;sector;sites;solanum;solanum lycopersicum;source;spread;strengthen;study;study area;survey;survey result;sustain;times;tomato;tomato solanum;urban growth;valley;valley kv;variables;vegetable;vegetable disease;vegetable farmer;vegetable farming;vegetable product;vegetable sector;vegetables;views,farmer livelihood;farmers;insights;kathmandu;livelihood;livelihood insight;valley;vegetable;vegetable farming,117

It was shown that urban gardening has an influence on consumer behavior and can induce a change towards a more sustainable lifestyle. The gardens provide a space for the exchange of social values, knowledge and ideas on different ways of life among the diverse participants. Hence, urban gardening creates far more than just food; it influences society on multiple levels. Urban gardening can support the bottom-up societal transition towards a bioeconomy as both have common attributes. Finally, the paper proposes an innovative, resource-efficient cultivation system that may attract further societal groups to the urban gardening lifestyle, with the aim of fostering the development of the bioeconomy",bioeconomy;characterization;cultivation methods;motivations;societal transition;survey;terrabioponics;transformative group;urban gardening,climate change;conservation status;cultivation;garden;lifestyle;natural resource;resource use;survey method;urban area;urbanization;germany,"Winkler, B.; Department of Biobased Products and Energy Crops (340b), Institute of Crop Science, University of Hohenheim, Fruwirthstrasse 23, Germany; email: b.winkler@uni-hohenheim.de",,MDPI AG,20711050,,,,English,Sustainability,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85061101791,3,Germany,Germany,department of biobased products and energy crops (340b),department of biobased products and energy crops (340b),aim;attract;attributes;awareness;behavior;bioeconomy;bottomup;bottomup societal;change;change mitigation;change towards;characterization;climate;climate change;common attribute;conscious producer;conservation;consumer;consumer behavior;consumers;creates;cultivation;cultivation method;cultivation system;cycles;development;different way;diverse;diverse participant;environmental conservation;exchange;extensive review;food;garden provide;gardeners;gardening;gardening creates;gardening lifestyle;gardening project;gardens;germany;groups;hence;ideas;induce;influence;influence society;influences;insight;knowledge;levels;life;lifestyle;methods;mitigation;motivations;multiple;multiple level;natural resource;number;online;online survey;paper;paper proposes;participant consumer;participants;producers;project;project participant;project website;proposes;provide;resource;resource cycle;resourceefficient;resourceefficient cultivation;review;social value;societal;societal group;societal transition;society;space;study;subsequent;subsequent online;support;survey;sustainable lifestyle;system;technologies;towards;transition;transition towards;turn;urban gardening;values;ways;websites,bioeconomy;gardening;germany;lifestyle;societal;societal transition;sustainable lifestyle;transition;urban gardening,118

In this study, we collected technical, economic and production data from a pilot aquaponic plant producing lettuce (Lactuca sativa) and Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) realized in an urban context in Sicily (Southern Italy), very suitable area for aquaponic production in relation to the Mediterranean climate. Through the determination of Net return and Break Even Point, analysing on one side the items which contribute to the investment (planning, construction and set up) and to the running costs, and on the other side the revenues from sales of lettuce and tilapia, its financial feasibility has been assessed. The results of the financial analysis performed for the first year of the experimental activity of the pilot unit have clearly demonstrated that aquaponic farming is likely to be profitable since the operating income is positive and about €290. The sensitivity analysis outlined in this paper suggests that the economic viability of the pilot unit might be slightly more susceptible to a decrease in total revenue rather than in operating costs. Findings provide important insights to help future aquaponic entrepreneurs formulate a business plan and allow a wider development of such a productive technology as a valid technique in boosting urban farming in the Mediterranean climate",aquaculture;break-even analysis;hydroponics;lettuce;net return;sustainability;tilapia;urban farming,cichlid;dicotyledon;feasibility study;food production;hydroponics;sensitivity analysis;urban area;urban region;italy;mediterranean region;sicily;lactuca;lactuca sativa;oreochromis niloticus;tilapia,"Borsellino, V.; Universita degli Studi di Palermo, Department of Agricultural, Food and Forest Sciences, Viale delle Scienze 13, Italy; email: valeria.borsellino@unipa.it",,Elsevier GmbH,16188667,,,,English,Urban For Urban Greening,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85061338411,4,Italy,Italy,universita degli studi di palermo;universita degli studi di palermo,universita degli studi di palermo,activity;analysis;aquaponic;aquaponic entrepreneur;aquaponic farming;aquaponic plant;aquaponic production;aquaponics;area;break;business;business plan;circular;circular economy;climate;construction;context;contribute;costs;data;decrease;determination;development;economic viability;economy;economy principle;entrepreneur formulate;entrepreneurs;experimental;experimental activity;feasibility;financial analysis;financial feasibility;findings;first year;food;food production;food productivity;formulate;future;future aquaponic;help;help future;important insight;income;inputs;insights;investment;investment planning;italy;items;lactuca;lactuca sativa;land;large food;lettuce;lettuce lactuca;mediterranean;mediterranean climate;natural system;net;net return;nile;nile tilapia;niloticus;nonagricultural land;operating;operating cost;oreochromis;oreochromis niloticus;paper;pilot;pilot aquaponic;pilot unit;plan;planning;plant;point;principles;production;production data;productive technology;productivity;provide;relation;results;return;revenue;revenues;sales;sativa;sensitivity;sensitivity analysis;set;side;solution;southern italy;study;suggests;suitable area;sustainable food;system;technique;technology;tilapia;tilapia oreochromis;time;total revenue;unit;urban context;urban farming;valid technique;viability;waste;wider;wider development;year;€290,aquaponic;aquaponic system;context;feasibility;feasibility study;financial feasibility;mediterranean;mediterranean urban;study;system;urban context,119

Recent studies show that following extreme storm events community gardens can supply food, enhance social empowerment, provide safe gathering spots, and restorative practices, to remind people of normality. However, the beneficial role played by community gardens following earthquakes is less well known. To fill this gap, the study examines the role played by a community garden in Christchurch, New Zealand, following the 2010/2011 Canterbury Earthquakes. The garden's role is evaluated based on a questionnaire-based survey and in-depth interviews with gardeners, as well as on data regarding the garden use before and after the earthquakes. Findings indicate the garden helped gardeners cope with the post-quake situation. The garden served as an important place to de-stress, share experiences, and gain community support.

Via semi-structured interviews with community gardeners in the Boston area (N = 17), multifactorial motivations associated with gardening as well as ongoing environmental health challenges were reported. Gardeners are knowledgeable about their garden’s historical past and are concerned with soil quality, theft, trash maintenance, animal waste, and loss of produce from foraging animals. Study findings directly inform the field of environmental health exposure assessments by reporting gardening duration, activities that can lead to incidental soil ingestion, and consumption patterns of locally grown produce.

Climate change is another major challenge that contemporary farming practice tries to overcome. Conventional soil dependent farming practices make farmers vulnerable to various manifestations of climate change. Different technologies were employed to enable farming practices to adapt and build resilience against irregular microclimate shifts. It is imperative that modern farmers need to be equipped with precise management and monitoring of the crop system with access to the scientific data about the field environment to execute intelligent and informed decisions in time. Alternate farming technology like hydroponic culture technique and integration of smart artificial light and IoT system are deemed promising solutions to the aforementioned problems. In this study, we have developed a smart hydroponic system with LED lighting technology enabled by IoT system. Plants were hydroponically cultured under various treatments and morphological parameters were measured and characterized.

Urban food production may help to solve this challenge; however, little research has examined the productivity of urban farming systems. We investigated inputs and produce yields over a 1-y period in 13 small-scale organic farms and gardens in Sydney, Australia. We found mean yields to be 5.94 kg·m−2, around twice the yield of typical Australian commercial vegetable farms. While these systems used land efficiently, economic and emergy (embodied energy) analyses showed they were relatively inefficient in their use of material and labor resources. Benefit-to-cost ratios demonstrated that, on average, the gardens ran at a financial loss and emergy transformity was one to three orders of magnitude greater than many conventional rural farms. Only 14.66% of all inputs were considered “renewable,” resulting in a moderate mean environmental loading ratio (ELR) of 5.82, a value within the range of many conventional farming systems.

Nonetheless, sustaining the people's participation in urban farming is challenging. Despite numerous researches in the past on the types of motivations for urban farming participation, only a few of those researches have been on the motivations of urban farming participants in Malaysia. This paper reports on a research about the motivational factors for urban farming participation in the state of Selangor, Malaysia. A questionnaire survey was conducted, of which the respondents comprised 243 practitioners of urban farming in Selangor. The results revealed that physical and mental health and the environment were the motivations with the highest scores among urban farming practitioners. Further investigations are warranted to understand the influences of age, gender and race on urban farming motivations and to help sustain urban farming programs.

However, the recent proliferation of urban gardening in other geographies, such as southern Europe in the aftermath of the economic crisis of 2007–2008, remains underexplored. The economic crisis put on hold urban developments in many southern European cities, leaving idle plots of land waiting to be urbanized. The crisis also triggered radical political demands, such as those of the Indignados, as well as fuelling narratives revolving around social entrepreneurship and social innovation. Barcelona emerges as a laboratory of urban gardening initiatives in vacant lots mobilizing either radical urban demands or embedding new post-crisis rhetoric around social entrepreneurship. Through a combination of qualitative methods, including participant observation, a literature review, semi-structured interviews, informal conversations and field diaries, we present a characterization and evolution of the three most prominent urban gardening initiatives in the city of Barcelona (including 54 gardens at the end of 2016): the Network of Municipal Gardens (municipally led gardens for retired people); the Network of Communitarian Gardens (social movements); and the Empty Plots Plan (social entrepreneurial urban gardening). Subsequently, we discuss the different meanings of gardening in crisis/post-crisis Barcelona as well as the urban politics that each initiative articulates. Our results show that urban gardens within the city are an expression of different and non-exclusive meanings that explicitly or implicitly, in a context of crisis and post-crisis, mobilize notions of political gardening",allotments;community gardens;political gardening;social entrepreneurship;urban agriculture;vacant urban land,,"March, H.; Universitat Oberta de CatalunyaSpain; email: hmarch@uoc.edu",,SAGE Publications Ltd,09697764,,,,English,Eur Urban Reg Stud,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85055213463,2,Spain,Spain,universitat oberta de catalunya,universitat oberta de catalunya,20th century;academic attention;aftermath;america;articulates;attention;barcelona;barcelona emerges;century;characterization;cities;city;combination;communitarian;communitarian garden;context;conversations;crisis;crisispostcrisis;crisispostcrisis barcelona;deal;demands;developments;diaries;different meaning;discuss;economic crisis;emerges;empty plot;end;entrepreneurial urban;entrepreneurship;europe;european city;evolution;expression;field;field diary;garden;gardening;gardening initiative;gardens;geographies;great deal;hold;idle plot;indignados;informal conversation;initiative;initiative articulates;initiatives;innovation;interviews;laboratory;land;literature;literature review;lots;meanings;methods;mobilize;movements;municipal garden;narrative revolving;narratives;network;new postcrisis;nonexclusive meaning;north;north america;northern europe;notions;observation;participant;participant observation;people;plan;plot plan;plots;political demand;political gardening;politics;postcrisis;postcrisis rhetoric;present;proliferation;prominent;prominent urban;put;qualitative;qualitative method;radical urban;recent proliferation;remains;result show;results;retired people;review;rhetoric;show;social entrepreneurial;social entrepreneurship;social innovation;social movement;southern europe;urban demand;urban development;urban garden;urban gardening;urban politics;vacant;vacant lot,barcelona;case;crisis;european perspective;gardening;gardening initiative;initiatives;perspective;postcrisis;postcrisis urban;urban gardening,126

Due to several reasons, such as better quality of produce, less expensive alternative, and with the accessibility of the Internet, it has been made possible for people to gain the information they need for gardening and equipment. The recent advancement and dependence on the Internet today, allowed the development of Internet of things (IoT). With IoT, it is possible to connect anything to the “cloud” using hardware such as a microcontroller units. Application of this technology could be seen from agriculture, manufacturing, health and home security. This study focused on the integration of urban agriculture on indoor gardening. The developed system provided plant owners and enthusiasts a possible way of monitoring plants’ condition in an indoor setup through a mobile application. The mobile application gives updates and information, such as light and water plant needs, through the use of microcontroller unit sensors and other components. Sensors used and connected to the indoor plants provide information like the indoor temperature and humidity, plant’s soil moisture and the water level of the water source. By using a mobile application, analysis of the plant conditions can be determined and known by the plant owners through a connection with the cloud.

By taking a practice theories’ perspective, the research suggests that social innovations diffuse through travelling elements of material, competence and meaning rather than solely through social interaction. This explains why similar social innovations, for example, urban gardening initiatives, emerge at a global scale without interaction between actors of different initiatives. It is argued that practice fields of social innovations promote the diffusion. Practice fields are bundles of similar social innovation initiatives, for example, car-sharing, urban gardening, repair cafes, etc. and facilitate the travelling of elements. Several further advantages are related to studying social innovation with a practice theories’ approach. These are amongst others the focus on activity and doing in contrast to different actors and their roles, the consideration of technology as an integral part of a practice and not as something opposed to social innovation, and the pronunciation of meaning giving credit to societal values and symbolic attributes related to social innovation",innovation diffusion;practice theories;social innovation,,"Rabadjieva, M.; Institute for Work and Technology, Westphalian University of Applied Sciences Gelsenkirchen Bocholt RecklinghausenGermany; email: rabadjieva@iat.eu",,Routledge,09654313,,,,English,Eur Plann Stud,Article,Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85061434711,2,Germany,Germany,institute for work and technology,institute for work and technology,activity;actors;advantages;amongst;amongst others;analyses;approach;attributes;bundles;cafes;competence;consideration;contrast;credit;development;different actor;different initiative;diffuse;diffusion;elements;emerge;etc;example;explains;facilitate;fields;focus;gardening;gardening initiative;global scale;initial development;initiatives;innovation;innovation diffuse;innovation initiative;innovation promote;innovations;integral part;interaction;material;meaning;others;paper;paper analysis;part;perspective;practice;practice field;practice theories’;promote;pronunciation;repair;repair cafes;research;roles;scale;social innovation;social interaction;societal;societal value;something;suggests;symbolic;symbolic attribute;technology;theories’;theories’ approach;urban gardening;values,diffusion;emergence;fields;innovation;practice;practice field;social innovation,129

The subsequent section sheds light on the theoretical developments in relation to which the notion of study practice has been conceived in the first place, in particular the methodological debates which saw a turn to practices on the one hand, and the theoretical discussions about the concept of study on the other hand. Analysis of the urban farming initiative torekes in terms of a study practice allows for fleshing out the educational dynamics at play in such practices: composition, problematization, and attention. We contrast such an educational analysis with sociological and political analyses that understand this initiative as aimed at social cohesion or political subjectification respectively.

The efficiency of water use is depended on performance of the irrigation technologies and management practices. In this study, a robotic irrigation system was developed that consists of a moving bridge manipulator and a sensor-based platform. The manipulator constructed is partly using open-source components and software, and is easily reconfigurable and extendable. In combination to the sensor-based platform this custom-made manipulator has the potential to monitor the soil water content (SWC) in real time. The irrigation robotic system was tested in an experimental soil tank. The total surface of the soil tank was divided by a raster into 18 equal quadrants. The water management for maintaining water content in the soil tank within tolerable lower limit (refill point) was based on three irrigation treatments: i) quadrants whose SWC is below the refill point are irrigated; ii) quadrants are irrigated only when the daily mean SWC of the tank is below the refill point and only for those whose actual SWC is lower than that limit; and iii) quadrants are irrigated every two days with constant amount of water. A comparison of the results of the three irrigation treatments showed that the second treatment gave less irrigation events and less applied water. Finally, we could conclude that the performance of the fabricated robotic system is appropriate and it could play an important role in achieving sustainable irrigation into urban food systems",farming automation;intelligent irrigation;single-board microcontroller;soil moisture sensor,,"Gravalos, I.; School of Agricultural Sciences, University of Thessaly, Periferiaki Larissas-Trikalon,, Greece; email: gravalos@teilar.gr",,Page Press Publications,19747071,,,,English,Journal of Agricultural Engineering,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85076362288,5,Greece,Greece,school of agricultural sciences,school of agricultural sciences,actual swc;agriculture;amount;applied water;appropriate;bridge;bridge manipulator;combination;comparison;components;conclude;conserve;conserve water;consists;constant amount;content;content swc;continued population;custommade;custommade manipulator;daily mean;days;developed;efficiency;equal quadrant;events;experimental;experimental soil;food;food system;gardening;growth;ii;ii quadrant;iii;iii quadrant;important role;irrigation;irrigation event;irrigation robotic;irrigation system;irrigation technology;irrigation treatment;le irrigation;limit;limit refill;limits;management;management practice;manipulator;mean;mean swc;measures;monitor;opensource;opensource component;performance;platform;play;point;population;population growth;practices;quadrants;raster;real time;refill;refill point;results;robotic irrigation;robotic system;role;search;second treatment;software;soil;soil tank;soil water;study;supply;supply limit;surface;sustainable irrigation;swc;system;systems;tank;technologies;time;total surface;treatment;treatments;urban food;urban gardening;use;water;water content;water management;water supply;water use,agriculture;gardening;irrigation;irrigation system;robotic irrigation;system;urban gardening,133

Drawing upon the work of George Bataille, this paper conceptualises the economy as a superlative and prodigal system of energy exchange that, by definition, is over-productive and wasteful. In this framing, diversity is not the result of positive relations but emerges from the prolific nature of the general economy.

The adaptive reuse of these garages is challenged through the continuity of urban change and the need for new mixed-use typologies. The development of technologically advanced farming in these structures could become an innovative strategy that as an interim solution justifies renovation versus demolition and new construction. The paper presents findings from the first stage of the multiple-site case study research on car-parking structures strategically selected in 3 UK cities (Portsmouth, Bristol and Brighton). In order to develop a better understanding of the conditions that enable the implementation of urban hydroponic farming in selected structures planning and technical limitations and opportunities have been identified through the analysis of policies, exploration of layouts using Revit software, field observation and photography. The analysis demonstrated that there is a range of possible uses that may be developed in the process of up-cycling of inner-city car-parking structures, of which one might be hydroponics. Looking at three multi-storey garages has shown that these have similar problems for adaptive reuse, which can be overcome with appropriate architectural strategies. Converting these structures for farming could support addressing social, environmental and economic problems. However, the proposed development requires innovations in planning documents. Further analysis needs to be conducted to assess whether the amount of food that could be produced in such a structure is efficient and comparable with other means of achieving it",adaptive reuse and up-cycling;hydroponics;local food production;multi-storey car-parking structures;sustainable architecture;urban farming,,"Szopinska-Mularz, M.; Cluster for Sustainable Cities, Faculty of Creative and Cultural Industries, University of PortsmouthUnited Kingdom; email: monika.szopinska-mularz@port.ac.uk",,Ubiquity Press,23639075,,,,English,Future Cities Environ,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85073358269,2,United Kingdom;United States,United Kingdom,university of portsmouth;university of nevada,university of portsmouth,adaptive reuse;advanced farming;amount;analysis;analysis need;appropriate;architectural strategy;assess;become;brighton;bristol;carparking structure;case;case study;challenged;change;cities;city portsmouth;concepts;conditions;construction;continuity;demolition;developed;development;direction;documents;economic problem;efficient;exploration;field;field observation;findings;food;future;future direction;garages;global concept;hydroponic;hydroponic farming;hydroponics;implementation;increase;innercity;innercity multistorey;innovations;innovative strategy;interim;interim solution;justifies;layouts;limitations;lowcarbon;lowcarbon mobility;means;mixeduse;mixeduse typology;mobility;multiplesite;multiplesite case;multistorey;multistorey garage;need;needs;new construction;new mixeduse;number;observation;obsolete;obsolete innercity;opportunities;order;overcome;paper;paper present;photography;planning;planning document;policies;portsmouth;present finding;presents;problems;process;range;renovation;renovation versus;research;reuse;revit;revit software;similar problem;software;solution;solution justifies;stage;strategies;strategy;structure;structure planning;structures;study;study research;support;technical limitation;transport;typologies;uk;uk city;urban change;urban hydroponic;uses;versus;versus demolition,adaptive reuse;carparking structure;innercity;innercity multistorey;multistorey;reuse;reuse potential;structure adaptive;structures;urban farming,137

Nevertheless, certain challenging problems associated with urban farming, including a lack of cultivation space and the effects of urban heat islands, must still be solved. Relatedly, a grower must, in some cases, also know how to utilize various forms of technology, such as lighting systems, as well as factors such as water availability. In this study, an original rooftop polytunnel design for lettuce (Lactuca sativa cv. Lollo Rosso) cultivation equipped with a hydroponic system and light emitting diodes (LEDs) is proposed. Various monochromatic lights were also tested for their effects on different quality parameters of lettuce. Specifically, supplemental red (655 nm), blue (445 nm), green (520 nm), and ultraviolet (380 nm) LED lights were used at night to apply photon fluxes of 150, 150, 150, and 20 μmol m-2 s-1, respectively. The resulting effects of these different colored LEDs on the pigment concentration and growth response of the lettuce grown inside the roof polytunnel were then investigated. The experiment was then repeated several times with different environmental parameters in order to compare the effects of the different light wavelengths under higher temperatures and higher natural irradiation conditions. The results indicated that supplemental red or blue light at night could be strategically employed to maintain low nitrate levels and enhance the nutritional value and growth of lettuce grown in roof polytunnels",hydroponic;leds;light emitting-diodes;red lettuce;rooftop polytunnel;urban agriculture,cultivation;irradiation;roofs;technology transfer;vegetables;environmental parameter;hydroponic;monochromatic light;natural irradiation;pigment concentration;red lettuce;rooftop polytunnel;urban agricultures;light emitting diodes,"Chang, C.-L.No. 1, Shuefu Road, Taiwan; email: chungliang@mail.npust.edu.tw",,American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers,08838542,,AEAGE,,English,Appl Eng Agric,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85071864936,3,Taiwan,Taiwan,department of biomechatronics engineering,department of biomechatronics engineering,access;availability;blue;blue light;cases;compare;concentration;conditions;cultivation;cultivation space;cv;design;different light;different quality;diodes;direct access;dwellers;effects;enhance;environmental parameter;experiment;factors;fluxes;forms;fresh vegetable;grower;growers;grown;growth;growth response;heat;heat island;hydroponic;hydroponic system;irradiation;irradiation condition;islands;lack;lactuca;lactuca sativa;leds;lettuce;lettuce grown;lettuce lactuca;levels;light;light wavelength;lights;lollo;lollo rosso;low nitrate;m2;m2 s1;maintain;monochromatic light;natural irradiation;night;nitrate;nitrate level;nm;nutritional value;order;original rooftop;parameters;photon;photon flux;pigment;pigment concentration;polytunnel;polytunnels;problems;provide;quality;quality parameter;red nm;response;results;roof;roof polytunnel;roof polytunnels;rooftop;rooftop polytunnel;rosso;rosso cultivation;s1;sativa;sativa cv;several time;space;study;supplemental;system;systems;technology;temperatures;times;ultraviolet;ultraviolet nm;urban dweller;urban farming;urban heat;value;various form;vegetable;vegetable grower;vegetables;water;water availability;wavelengths;μmol;μmol m2,irradiation;lettuce;lights;modern urban;polytunnels;rooftop;rooftop polytunnels;supplemental;supplemental irradiation;urban rooftop,138

The United Nations estimates that 68% of the world’s inhabitants will be living in urban areas by 2050, with most cities ill-prepared to receive the newcomers. To adapt to the population increase, the cities have to either spread their footprint or become denser, with innovative urban strategies like smart growth implemented more in the developed world than the developing world. As the world population becomes increasingly urban, the challenge for designers will be to develop dwellings that are smarter and smaller to allow for an increase in density without losing public spaces, wasting energy or damaging the quality of life of its users. This paper will propose a new typology of sustainable, self-sufficient dwelling units, designed to create mixed age and socio-economical level communities in existing neighborhoods where building typologies have not changed much since the 1950s (in the USA). The basis for this next generation dwelling typology will produce a systemic interdependence between its functional and design elements by providing: spatial adaptability, production and filtration of water, generation of energy, urban farming and the interdependence of all these systems to sustain a live/work/farm environment in an affordable way that appeals to the consumer by bettering their quality of life and, at the same time, it does so while triplicating the population density per block. Right-sizing will be an essential aspect of this process, as we develop dwelling units designed to be versatile, adjustable, and user friendly.

What distinguishes sitopia is that it shapes itself consciously, using food as a tool. The first step toward sitopia is to understand the nature of this tool. Safe, reliable, and affordable supplies of food are essential for community prosperity as well as national security. Local food production is an excellent example of community greening as well as an import substitution strategy: Keeping more money within a city or region, while using less energy to produce and distribute fresh, healthy food. In cities with large amounts of vacant land and low-income residents, such as Baltimore, Detroit, and New Orleans, urban farming could greatly help with greening the city and revitalizing neighborhoods.

We introduce the integrative concept of ecosocial innovation in order to demonstrate how grassroots innovations can successfully combine social, ecological and economic aspects of a sustainability transition. By ecosocial innovations, we refer to social innovations with a strong ecological orientation (e.g., recycling workshops, urban gardening, participatory unemployment projects and new local economies). The data consists of 50 examples of ecosocial innovations in Finland, Italy, Germany, Belgium and the UK.We investigate how ecosocial innovations interconnect ecological, economic and social goals and study the factors of their integrative crucial capacity. On the basis of qualitative data analysis and thematic categorisation of ecosocial innovations, we identify five integrative practices: diversity of activities, successful networking, addressing new livelihood, focus on food and explicit conceptual work on sustainability.

With the continent's cities projected to double in population by 2050, the issue of food insecurity in urban areas is increasingly becoming a major concern. To sustain this urban explosion, the question of how to maintain constant food supply to urban residents remains an urgent priority since these locations do not always get access to adequate food. There has, however, been little work on examining urban agriculture (UA) as an alternative means of reducing hunger in Africa, especially in the face of climate change. Some city authorities have argued that UA must be shifted to rural areas since they constitute a public health nuisance. The paper, however, is based on the hypothesis that food production in locations with high demands mitigates against climate change and addresses Africa's food insecurities by exploiting new avenues for cultivation. To this end, an extensive literature review was conducted, resulting in the identification of different degrees of opposition from policy-makers and urban authorities, who usually underrate the actual contribution and value of UA to urban food security. It is recommended that, considering the increasing recognition of urban farming, planners and policy makers must collectively design interventions to enhance urban food production",africa;climate change;urban agriculture,,"Nkrumah, B.; School of Social Sciences, University of KwaZulu-NatalSouth Africa; email: bright.nkrumahup@gmail.com",,University of Kassel,2197411X,,,,English,"Future of Food: J Food, Agriculture Soc",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85069481241,1,South Africa,South Africa,school of social sciences,school of social sciences,access;actual contribution;address africa;addresses;adequate;adequate food;africa;africa food;africans;africas;agriculture;agriculture ua;alternative;alternative mean;areas;authorities;avenues;change;cities;city;city authority;climate;climate change;concern;constant food;constitute;continent city;continents;contribution;cultivation;degrees;demand mitigates;demands;design;design intervention;different degree;end;enhance;enhance urban;explosion;extensive literature;face;food;food insecurity;food production;food security;food supply;health;health nuisance;high demand;hunger;hypothesis;identification;insecurities;insecurity;interventions;issue;literature;literature review;little work;locations;maintain;maintain constant;major concern;makers;means;mitigates;new avenue;nuisance;opposition;paper;planners;policy;policy maker;policymakers;population;priority;production;public;public health;question;recognition;remains;resident remains;residents;review;rural area;security;supply;sustain;ua;underrate;urban agriculture;urban area;urban authority;urban explosion;urban farming;urban food;urban resident;urgent;urgent priority;value;work,africa future;africas;agriculture;change;climate;climate change;era;future;urban agriculture,144

A new, circular approach is needed to enable better decision-making on the selection of innovative architectural solutions for all phases of a building’s life cycle. The current building sector’s business model must be redesigned to include the application of new and improved methods, solutions and innovative services, and advance a positive transition from a linear economy to a circular economy. We will present the circular interventions carried out on a centenary building located in Vienna in the framework of the HOUSEFUL project. HOUSEFUL is an EU-funded initiative with the objective to develop and demonstrate integrated circular services, focusing on the optimal management of resources throughout the life cycle of new or existing buildings. The demonstration will include technologies to circulate all process flows while reducing the overall energy demand. These technologies will be offered as integrated services to produce treated rain and wastewater for internal reuse, the generation of renewable energy from biogas, compost production combined with urban gardening and for the use of nutrients in a greenhouse. The design of more efficient processes, such as green walls, innovative conservatories, building-integrated solar thermal and photovoltaic panels will improve building energy efficiency. All process flows will be intensely monitored to ensure safety and collect data for further replication cases. The solutions will also include the use of sustainable and upcycled materials and the implementation will be based on the principles of reversibility and de-constructability. The final services of the building will be elaborated in co-creation workshops with a multitude of stakeholders.

They also provide us with, medicine, fabrics, building materials, biofuels, pulp, etc. Hence enhanced plant growth and health would directly contribute to the economy and development of nations. For this, a systematic understanding of plant biology is essential. From time to time plant biology has benefited immensely from various disciplines and platform technologies like genetics, breeding, microbiology and biotechnology, etc. Recently nanotechnology is contributing towards many discoveries in plant biology and utilization of plant resources. Nanomaterials (NM) are advantageous due to their characteristic dimension-based properties and amenability to real-time analyses with very low cost. They are used for monitoring plant metabolism and signalling pathways. NMs such as quantum dots (QD) serve as probes with unsurpassed accuracy. Engineered nanomaterials (ENM) have gained importance as bio-imaging agents, diagnostic tools for analysing plant pathogen interaction, nano-carriers for the delivery of genes and agrochemicals of interest. Here, we discuss the applications of ENMs in plant biology with respect to nutrient management, regulation of plant growth, gene detection and preservation, disease diagnostics and control.

The present paper highlights the changing land use pattern and urban agricultural planning in Delhi-Central National Capital Region (CNCR). To study the changes in the land use pattern as well as urban agricultural planning, Land sat 8OLI and TIRS satellite imageries have been used for two time periods i.e. 2006 and 2016. The imageries have been pre-processed with standardised methods such as radiometric and geometric rectifications then Maximum Likelihood method has been used to categorize the images into seven classes, namely: forest, built-up, plantation, barren land, water bodies, fallow land and agricultural land to analyses dynamics of land use. It has been found that over the period of time natural vegetation and agricultural land are shrinking in this region and have been put to non-agricultural uses due to rapid urbanization and industrialization. The loss is primarily occurred in the south and eastern part of the periurban region whereas northern and north-eastern part still be conserved for urban agricultural planning.

The city is experiencing rapid urban growth which is not without its impact on urban agriculture. This paper traces the developments in the conditions of farmland in the district during the last two decades. With increasing population and economic activities, land demand for housing and other nonfarm uses like industries, commercial and transport is rising. The built-up area is expanding in all directions around the city, which is the best agricultural land except along its western side that is barren land. Therefore, any expansion in built environment has resulted and is resulting in diminishing farmland. This paper analyses how farmland has been engulfed by nonfarm uses in the process of urban expansion. An interesting fact in the case of Peshawar is that while agricultural land is being lost, some new agricultural land is also being gained. In 1991 agricultural land constituted 41 percent of the total land area of the city, which increased to about 58 percent in 1997.

The purpose of this research work was to highlight the detrimental effects of pyrethroids (bifenthrin, cyfluthrin, cypermethrin, deltamethrin, fenvalerate, lambda-cyhalothrin, and permethrin) compare with dietary intake assessment of eggplant and okra grown in peri-urban environment. In this manner, a total of 180 (n = 60 × 3) samples of eggplant (Solanum melongena) and okra (Abelmoschus esculentus) were procured from the peri-urban farming system of Faisalabad, Multan, and Gujranwala to assess the pyrethroid residues along with their dietary intake assessment. The procured vegetables were quantified for pyrethroid residues by using gas chromatography (GC) equipped with an electron capture detector (ECD). Outcomes of this study revealed that for okra samples, the highest residues of bifenthrin (1.25 mg kg−1) were found in Gujranwala then Multan (1.5 mg kg−1) and Faisalabad (1.04 mg kg−1), whereas in eggplant, the highest residues were recorded for bifenthrin from Faisalabad (1.33 mg kg−1) and Gujranwala (0.78 mg kg−1). In Multan, the highest residues for cyfluthrin (1.18 mg kg−1) were reported in eggplant. Out of all analyzed samples for pyrethroid residues, 32% samples contained detectable residues and 6% samples exceeded their maximum residual limits (MRLs) established by the European Union (EU). Dietary intake assessment (mg kg−1 day−1) was calculated as per their maximum permissible intake (MPI) values, i.e., bifenthrin (1.28), cyfluthrin (1.28), cypermethrin (3.20), deltamethrin (0.64), fenvalerate (1.28), lambda-cyhalothrin (0.064), and permethrin (3.20) respectively. Conclusively, residues from the Multan region were greater than those from Gujranwala and Faisalabad showing excessive application of pyrethroids.

It becomes one of Semarang City government's efforts to fulfil urban society food needs. The background of the urban farming concept is the limitations of land in agriculture production by people living in the urban area. Urban farming in Semarang City consists of hydroponic and aquaponic. Hydroponic cultivation is easier to do because of the nutrients needed measurably derived from artificial nutrients (non-chemical). While in aquaponic have two elements, they are aquaculture and vegetables grown. Both of these urban farming concepts have the principle of planting media with no use of land and are appropriately implemented in urban areas. The purpose of this research is to know how urban farming management system in Semarang City. The research method used is quantitative descriptive and conducted in Semarang City.

The quality of urban soil can be improved by tillage and the incorporation of organic matter, or can be degraded by chemical treatments. Urban gardeners have a role in this process, through the selection of various cultivation techniques. Our study focuses on an allotment area in the town of Pisa (Italy), which since 1995 has been run as a municipal vegetable garden by the residents. We analysed the soil and compared the data with those collected five years previously, to verify the possible changes in soil properties and fertility. We also interviewed the gardeners regarding their backgrounds, motivations and cultivation practices. We looked for possible changes in the soil quality attributable to the cultivation techniques. We found that the allotment holders influenced the soil quality through the cultivation techniques. Organic carbon, electrical conductivity and the content of copper increased unevenly in relation to the gardeners’ cultivation practices. At the same time the study highlights that the urban gardeners were not completely aware of how to protect and enhance the fertility and the quality of urban soil. We believe that town councils should be responsible for providing correct information to the allotment holders and thus prevent the possible misuse of urban soil to grow food, as this can affect everyone's health",agricultural practices;copper;organic matter;urban allotments,biogeochemistry;biological materials;copper;organic carbon;soil conservation;soils;agricultural practices;chemical treatments;electrical conductivity;food production;soil property;soil quality;urban allotments;urban soils;cultivation;organic carbon;agricultural practice;copper;cultivation;culture;garden;horticulture;organic matter;soil fertility;soil quality;urban area;article;electric conductivity;gardening;horticulture;italy;priority journal;soil analysis;soil fertility;soil management;soil property;soil quality;tillage;urban area;cultural anthropology;environmental protection;procedures;soil;soil pollutant;vegetable;italy;pisa [pisa (prv)];pisa [tuscany];tuscany;conservation of natural resources;culture;gardening;italy;soil;soil pollutants;vegetables,"Bretzel, F.; CNR, Institute of Ecosystem Studies, Via Moruzzi 1, Italy; email: francesca.bretzel@ise.cnr.it",,Elsevier B.V.,00489697,,STEVA,29980084.0,English,Sci Total Environ,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85049326302,6,Italy,Italy,institute of ecosystem studies;institute of information science and technologies,institute of ecosystem studies,affect;affect everyones;allotment;allotment area;allotment holder;area;backgrounds;carbon;changes;chemical;chemical treatment;conductivity;content;copper;correct;correct information;councils;cultivation;cultivation practice;cultivation technique;data;electrical conductivity;enhance;everyones;fertility;focuses;food;food production;found;garden;gardeners;gardeners’;gardeners’ cultivation;grow;health;highlights;holders;importance;incorporation;information;interviewed;italy;matter;misuse;motivations;municipal vegetable;organic carbon;organic matter;pisa;pisa italy;possible change;possible misuse;practices;prevent;process;production;properties;protect;quality;relation;residents;role;selection;soil;soil property;soil quality;study;study focus;techniques;tillage;time;town;town council;treatments;urban cultivation;urban gardener;urban soil;various cultivation;vegetable;vegetable garden;verify;years,culture;gardening;horticulture;quality;soil;soil quality;urban gardening,152

Their management produces annually a large amount of biomass that traditionally has been either disposed of at dumping sites or has been burnt onsite. This paper presents an experimental study to obtain particleboard using this biomass in a low energy process (short pressing time and low pressing temperature), using particles of different sizes from the rachis (midrib) of the three palm species most representative of urban gardening in Spain: canary palm (Phoenix canariensis hort. ex Chabaud), date palm (Phoenix dactylifera L.) and washingtonia palm (Washingtonia robusta H. Wendl). Their physical and mechanical properties were tested, and the feasibility of their use as a construction material was evaluated. The results showed that the manufactured particleboard had similar performance to conventional wood particleboard and good thermal insulation properties. Boards made with the canary species showed better mechanical performance. The properties of the particleboard depended on the particle size and species. The use of the pruning waste of palm trees to produce durable materials such as particleboard could be beneficial to the environment since it is a method of carbon fixation, helping to decrease atmospheric pollution and reducing the amount of waste that ends in dumping sites",biomass;hot pressing;palm rachis;phoenix canariensis;phoenix dactylifera;thermal conductivity;washingtonia robusta,biomass;forestry;hot pressing;particle board;particle size;thermal conductivity;thermal insulation;atmospheric pollution;mechanical performance;palm rachis;phoenix canariensis;phoenix dactylifera;physical and mechanical properties;thermal insulation properties;washingtonia robusta;mechanical properties;angiosperm;biomass;mechanical property;physical property;pruning;thermal conductivity;biomass;forestry;hot pressing;particle size;thermal conductivity;thermal insulation;spain;phoenix canariensis;phoenix dactylifera;washingtonia;washingtonia robusta,"Ferrandez-Garcia, A.; Department of Engineering, Universidad Miguel Hernandez, Carretera de Beniel, Km. 3,2, Spain; email: antonio.ferrandezg@umh.es",,MDPI AG,19994907,,,,English,Forests,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85058160141,6,Spain,Spain,department of engineering;department of agroforestry engineering,department of engineering,amount;atmospheric pollution;biomass;boards;burnt;canariensis;canariensis hort;canary;canary palm;canary specie;carbon;carbon fixation;chabaud;construction;construction material;conventional wood;dactylifera;dactylifera l;date;date palm;decrease;decrease atmospheric;different size;durable material;ends;energy;energy process;environment;ex;ex chabaud;experimental;experimental study;feasibility;fixation;gardening;good thermal;h;hort;insulation;insulation property;l;large amount;low energy;low pressing;management;management produce;material;materials;mechanical performance;mechanical property;method;midrib;onsite;palm;palm phoenix;palm specie;palm tree;palm washingtonia;paper;paper present;particle;particle size;particleboard;particles;performance;phoenix;phoenix canariensis;phoenix dactylifera;pollution;presents;pressing time;process;produce;produces;properties;rachis;rachis midrib;representative;results;robusta;robusta h;short pressing;similar performance;sites;size;sizes;spain;spain canary;species;study;temperature;thermal;thermal insulation;time;trees;urban gardening;use;washingtonia;washingtonia palm;washingtonia robusta;waste;wendl;wood;wood particleboard,mechanical property;palm;palm tree;particleboard;properties;prunings;tree,153

Studies on economic aspects such as crop yields, inputs and outputs of production, productivity, gross margins and the contribution to home economics are rare, especially in Europe. While urban gardening plays an important role in the Global South, its role in Western Europe for food productivity and home economics is currently under-researched. The aim of this study is to analyse European urban gardeners’ economic performance and self-sufficiency on a household level, as well as to reach a better understanding of their contribution to food self-provision and food security in the metropolitan areas. In a study carried out in 2014 with on-site personal and with online questionnaires participated 180 urban gardeners from three case study cities (Ljubljana, Milan, and London). Results from the economic analysis showed that although for most urban gardeners, profit is not their main motivation, the economic calculation shows that productivity in small urban plots can be comparable to market garden production. Urban gardeners are saving money, especially when, compared to retail prices for regular produce or organic produce, their input is included in the gross margin calculation. We conclude that, in the case-study cities, the self-provisional potential of urban gardeners’ households to adequately cover the annual vegetable need of five-a-day servings can be met under three conditions: (1) sufficient garden size; (2) increased area productivity, and (3) sufficient labour-hour inputs",economic performance;motivation;productivity;self-sufficiency;urban gardening;vegetable production,crop yield;economic analysis;food production;food security;garden;home garden;metropolitan area;performance assessment;self sufficiency;vegetable;england;italy;ljubljana;lombardy;london [england];milan [milano];milano [lombardy];slovenia;united kingdom;western europe,"Glavan, M.; Department of Agronomy, Biotechnical faculty, University of Ljubljana, Jamnikarjeva 101, Slovenia; email: matjaz.glavan@bf.uni-lj.si",,Elsevier GmbH,16188667,,,,English,Urban For Urban Greening,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85056149635,9,Slovenia;United Kingdom;Italy,Slovenia,department of agronomy;centre for agroecology;department of agricultural and environmental sciences;centre for agroecology and food security,department of agronomy,academic interest;aim;analyse;analysis;annual vegetable;area;area productivity;areas;aspects;calculation;calculation show;case;case study;casestudy;casestudy city;cities;city ljubljana;conclude;condition;condition sufficient;conditions;contribution;cover;crop;crop yield;economic analysis;economic aspect;economic calculation;economic performance;economics;europe;european urban;fiveaday;food;food productivity;food security;food selfprovision;garden;garden production;garden size;gardeners;gardeners’;gardeners’ household;gardening;gardening play;global south;gross margin;home;home economics;household;household level;households;important role;input;inputs;interest;labourhour;labourhour input;level;ljubljana;london;main motivation;margin;margin calculation;margins;market;market garden;met;metropolitan;metropolitan area;milan;money;motivation;need;new phenomenon;online;online questionnaire;onsite;organic produce;outputs;participated urban;performance;phenomenon;plays;plots;prices;produce;production;productivity;profit;questionnaires;rare;reach;recent year;regular produce;results;retail price;role;security;selfprovision;selfprovisional potential;selfsufficiency;servings;shows;size;south;studies;study;study city;sufficient;sufficient garden;sufficient labourhour;urban gardener;urban gardeners’;urban gardening;urban plot;vegetable;vegetable need;western europe;years;yields,cities;city –;economic performance;european city;examples;gardening;ljubljana;london;milan;performance;urban gardening;–;– example,154

This paper reports on exploratory research, which used examples of SFSCs from London to build a more detailed understanding of different types of urban SFSC and their relative performance compared to each other. To do this, we undertook a participatory sustainability impact assessment (SIA) in which local food system stakeholders were asked to rank the perceived impacts of five different urban and peri-urban SFSCs compared with the current 'mainstream' food supply system (defined as supermarkets retailing mass-produced, standardized food products). The SFSCs ranked were: (1) urban gardening (self-supply), (2) urban gardening (commercial), (3) community supported agriculture (CSA), (4) direct sale (on-farm) and (5) direct sale (off-farm). Results from the SIA showed that CSAs were regarded as delivering the highest overall social, economic and environmental benefits, followed by urban gardening (commercial), urban gardening (self-supply) and direct sales (off-farm). The lowest overall rating was for the supply chain direct sales (on-farm). All five SFSCs were ranked highest on the social aspects of sustainability. Following the participatory SIA of perceived sustainability, we next developed a questionnaire in order to test the feasibility of measuring the specific (rather than 'perceived') impacts of an urban SFSC. We applied the test at a community-led local food market in South London, where we conducted face-to-face interviews with all market stallholders (18 respondents) and a random sample of consumers (51 respondents). Results from the community-led market were similar to those acquired at the SIA workshop, with greater agreement about the social benefits of the market, compared with economic and environmental impacts. The results also suggest that producers underestimated consumers' willingness to share the risks that the producers face and we identify this as an important aspect for future research.

The voluntarism, variety and multiple meanings of community gardening, it is argued, is hardly compatible with the regulatory anxiety and isomorphic pressures that most policy schemes imply. The regulation of community gardening, in this frame, is very often caught in a delicate balance of promotion and control, co-optation and “policing” and risks to exacerbate already existing distinctions between collaborative and confrontational initiatives. We believe that addressing this ambivalence is crucial to a proper understanding of the socio-political meaning of community gardening, and of the problematic relationship between communities’ self-organization, sustainable transitions, and urban governance in an age of austerity and neoliberalism. The topic is addressed with reference to the city of Rome, Italy, in light of a recently approved regulation for community gardening",community gardening;local policy;rome (italy);self-organization;sustainability transitions,governance approach;neoliberalism;policy making;self organization;sustainability;urban area;urban policy;voluntary approach;italy;lazio;roma [lazio];rome,"Celata, F.; University of Rome La Sapienza, Dept.

Inspired by transition theory, we look for regimes and niches which support retainment of green space and their adaptive capacity based on interviews and workshops with key urban stakeholders. A top-down master planning paradigm combined with a green institutional framework preoccupied with beautification seem to block possibilities of supporting and integrating GI experiments coming from outside the regime. The master plans are vague, outdated before finalised and inefficient for coping with the fast pace of urbanization. In Addis Ababa, despite an emergent recognition of the role of the green infrastructure in the city plan, informal encroachment and planned large scale land-conversions to housing takes place. In Dar es Salaam, that subscribes to, but lacks a functional master plan, the regime seems paralysed and is too fragmented and engrossed with the pressing urbanization problems to prioritize a green infrastructure. For establishing a functional green infrastructure coalition partners from housing, road and urban agriculture authorities but also large land owners, informal settlers, urban farmers and local organisations are needed. Solutions must be attractive also for the actual green space managers − the individual plot- and condominium owners and local groups. Local niche experiments linking up to on-going coping strategies could push forward coalitions as well as generating knowledge on how to retain green areas while addressing water shortages, livelihood and urban farming",addis ababa;dar es salaam;experiments;green infrastructure;transition theory;urban planning;water resilience,agriculture;experiments;housing;urban planning;addis ababa;coalition partners;coping strategies;dar es salaam;green infrastructure;institutional framework;transition theories;urban agricultures;economic and social effects;experimental study;greenspace;infrastructure planning;institutional framework;questionnaire survey;stakeholder;top-down approach;transitional economy;urban ecosystem;urban planning;urbanization;water planning;addis ababa;dar es salaam [dar es salaam (rga)];dar es salaam [tanzania];ethiopia;tanzania,"Herslund, L.; Department of Geosciences and Natural Resource Management, University of Copenhagen, Rolighedsvej 23, Denmark; email: lihe@ign.ku.dk",,Elsevier B.V.,01692046,,LUPLE,,English,Landsc Urban Plann,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85030849290,11,Denmark;Tanzania;Ethiopia,Denmark,department of geosciences and natural resource management;institute of human settlement studies;ethiopian institute of architecture,department of geosciences and natural resource management,ababa;actual green;adaptive capacity;addis;addis ababa;agriculture;agriculture authority;areas;authorities;beautification;block;block possibility;capacity;city;city plan;coalition;coalition partner;coalitions;conditions;condominium;condominium owner;dar;dar e;e salaam;emergent;emergent recognition;encroachment;es;examine;experiments;farmers;fast;framework;functional green;functional master;gi;gi experiment;green area;green infrastructure;green space;groups;housing;individual plot;inefficient;informal encroachment;informal settlers;infrastructure;infrastructure coalition;institutional framework;interviews;key;knowledge;lacks;land;land owner;landconversions;large land;large scale;livelihood;local group;local niche;local organisation;look;manager −;managers;master;master plan;master planning;niche;niche experiment;niches;opportunities;organisations;owners;pace;paper;paradigm;partners;place;plan;planning;planning paradigm;plans;plot;possibilities;pressure;prioritize;problems;push;recognition;regime;regimes;retain;retainment;road;role;salaam;scale;scale landconversions;seem;settlers;shortages;solutions;space;space manager;stakeholders;strategies;subscribes;support;support retainment;theory;topdown;topdown master;transition;transition theory;urban agriculture;urban farmer;urban farming;urban stakeholder;urbanization;urbanization problem;vague;water;water shortage;workshops;−,ababa;addis;addis ababa;cities;conditions;dar;dar e;e salaam;es;green infrastructure;infrastructure;infrastructure –;opportunities;salaam;waterresilient;waterresilient city;–,158

It drives and alters various aspects and aesthetics concerning a place. It affects a commons man's habits, living style, and eating preferences. As the population goes on increasing within an urbanizing area, the resources to adequately maintain the needs of the growing population decreases. Living area, Food and water are utilized tremendously making them the vulnerable resources. Due to scarcity of space and clean water, sustainability of these resources with time will be difficult. People in urban areas desire to have a small garden (e.g. Balcony Garden) as well as want to have healthy and clean food resources. A system which utilizes optimum space in such conditions and can support plants is needed.

This poses significant food security risk to low income households. Understanding how the dairy food system operates is essential to identify mitigation measures to food insecurity impact. This study aims to determine the structure and functionality of Nairobi's dairy system using a value chain mapping approach. Primary data were gathered through focus group discussions and key informant interviews with dairy value chain stakeholders in Nairobi to obtain qualitative information on people and products in the chains while describing their interactions and flows. Qualitative thematic analysis combined with flowcharts created by participants enabled identification of key food system segments and the development of chain profiles (or flow-diagrams) which together form Nairobi's dairy system. Seven chain profiles forming Nairobi's dairy value chain were identified. These were found to be dominated by small-scale individuals who operate largely independently. Our profiles for the urban and peri-urban farming systems were structurally similar in their downstream networks, obtaining inputs from similar sources. Upstream, the urban systems were shorter, supplying mostly to immediate neighbours or based on own consumption, while the peri urban systems supplied to a wider network and showed some affiliations to producers' associations. Two distinct profiles characterize the milk flow from traders belonging either to a Dairy Traders Association (DTA) or those not belonging to this association (non-DTA). DTA traders sell mainly to fixed retailers and non-DTA traders to mobile retailers (hawkers or roadside vendors). Profiles associated with medium and large cooperatives were driven by networks of collection centres, but with medium-sized cooperatives selling half of their production to large processing companies, and large cooperatives only to fixed retailers. Large processing companies' profiles indicated distribution of high volumes and value addition processing. They reported strategic milk collection arrangements with suppliers on long, medium - or short - term contracts and with well-established product distribution channels. We have identified numerous inter-linkages across dairy chain profiles in Nairobi's complex system, demonstrating significant interdependency among the stakeholders. Therefore, enhancing the system's efficiency requires a holistic, system-wide approach and any policy interventions should consider every segment of the value chain. This study provides a methodological approach for organizations and policy makers to understand and address structural and functional vulnerabilities within food systems more broadly.

Urban gardening projects are an option to show how vegetables grow and can be a chance for local supply. But often it is difficult to get a plot of the expensive land. The Bavarian State Institute for Viticulture and Horticulture in Veitshochheim, Germany, researches food production on extensive green roofs and living wall systems since 2014. In different tests vegetables were grown on roof models (24 plots, each about 4 m2) and former extensive green roofs (each about 50-100 m2). All areas were built like a typical one-layer green roof according to FLL-guideline (FLL, 2008). Mostly substrate got watered by drip irrigation and fertilised with granulated minerals adapted to the nutritional requirements. The yield and the vitality of all plants were observed. For an ecological improvement some variants were cultivated in a water circuit. Four different Living Wall systems (each about 6 m2) were tested on a wall in Veitshochheim. The systems had substrate, geomembrane and water for growing media. Each system had an own circuit for irrigation and fertilisation.

UA has been investigated as both social and an economic driving force to understand farming opportunities in both cities. To achieve this goal Business Model Canvas (BMC) was adopted as a research framework. Using the business model helps to move beyond the description of potential benefits and add explanations of how values are captured at the operational level. A classification based on BCM elements was used to outline some diversity in Italian and Argentinean UA. The paper aims to highlight how urban farming has to adjust to urban conditions by stepping into appropriate business models in order to be sustainable and profitable, and how Business Model Canvas is useful to analyze their organization and performances both economically and socially. The analysis demonstrates that UA is differently adjusted to specific social and environmental urban conditions, and that BMC is useful for analyzing urban farming. More specifically it shows that heterogeneous local food farms and the integration of local and organic food production in social farming business models are more frequent within Italian case studies. Local food farms and integration of local and agroecology food production in family farming business models are instead more frequent within Argentinian case studies",buenos aires;business canvas model;rome;social and solidarity economy;urban agriculture,,,Orsini F.Gianquinto G.P.Pennisi G.Cremonini L.Georgiadis T.,International Society for Horticultural Science,05677572,9789462612129,,,English,Acta Hortic,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85056884725,8,Italy;France;Argentina,Italy,department of agricultural;department of biosciences and territory;department of economy and administration;sapienza university;national university of quilmes;secretary of university extension de extension universitaria,department of agricultural,achieve;adjust;agriculture;agriculture ua;agroecology;agroecology food;aims;aires;analysis;analysis demonstrates;analyze;appropriate;appropriate business;argentinean;argentinean ua;argentinian case;bcm;bcm element;benefits;bmc;buenos;business;business model;canvas;canvas bmc;case;case study;cities;classification;comparison;conditions;demonstrates;description;diversity;economic driving;elements;explanations;family;farming business;farms;food;food farm;food production;force;framework;frequent;goal;goal business;helps;highlight;integration;italian case;level;local food;model;model canvas;model help;models;move;operational level;opportunities;order;organic food;organization;outline;paper;paper aim;paper present;performances;potential benefit;preliminary comparison;presents;production;research;research framework;roma;shows;social farming;studies;ua;understand;understand farming;urban agriculture;urban condition;urban farming;values,analysis;argentina;comparative;comparative analysis;italy;opportunities;urban farming,164

Urban farming can deliver an answer, but experience is still limited. At the same time, greenhouse horticulturalists face important challenges, such as availability of space and energy costs. To address these challenges, Inagro is building an 8000-m2 research greenhouse, Agrotopia, on the rooftop of a warehouse of REO Veiling, agricultural auction market. Integrated in the city of Roeselare (Belgium), the greenhouse will use resources from the city environment such as energy and water. The greenhouse aims to be energy neutral by exchanging residual heat and electricity with REO Veiling. A 6000-m2 cultivation area to grow vegetables soilless, will allow to develop and demonstrate best practices for hydroponic systems. One compartment will be equipped for multilayer indoor growing with artificial lighting. A 12-m high vertical compartment will allow to explore the potential of growing vegetables along high walls and maximize cultivation area. Specific attention will be paid to minimize energy use by applying the Dutch concept of ""Next Generation Growing"" and comparing different types of energy screens. Other research topics will include integrated pest management, reuse of nutrient waste solutions, use of low-grade heat from the city waste incinerator, possible applications for non-harvestable plant tissues, etc. The greenhouse will also serve as a living lab to exchange knowledge and develop innovations through co-creation, involving all relevant stakeholders in the innovation process. Technology developers will have the opportunity to engage in this co-creation process or to demonstrate their latest innovations in an exhibition room.

In this study qualitative research topics were identified: (1) interdisciplinary contribution to introduce further improvement of currently monofunctional ecosystem services with awareness of contradictions among ecological, economical and socio-cultural requirements. Most of them can be reduced or minimized in ongoing design process allocating spatial and/or functional concepts; (2) increasing awareness of stakeholders of the importance of high quality and variety of green urban open spaces as a factor of citizen satisfaction; (3) need to improve and intensify the collaboration between public administration, service providers and private stakeholders; (4) stressing high significance of trees regarding climatic services as well as their contribution to quality of life in residential areas while considerable need for improving the ecological conditions of their growth, protection of existing ones against damage from building activities and vehicle impact as well as enhancing of resilience of urban forest towards climatic stress; (5) the existence of operational measures to manage and support the use of garden plots where strategic concepts to popularize and augment the quality of various forms of urban gardening and horticulture by offering space, information and technical support to potential users are missing. Advantages of multidisciplinary approaches are a better exchange of knowledge and ideas in a wider context, bringing up topics and recommendations for further developments. In addition, analytical findings, bridging visions, conceptual and management suggestions can include unconventional and long-term oriented ideas, thus stimulating a more sustainable self-guided development process.

The ecosystem services approach can be applied for addressing peri-urban farming. In order to identify sustainable actions, strategies and policies for the management of Turin Metropolitan Area agricultural production, a multidisciplinary study was carried out. The Chieri municipality (Piedmont, North-West Italy) characterised by high natural valued agricultural patterns and typical local products was chosen as case study. Since 2016, Chieri municipality was included in the Man and the Biosphere (MAB) UNESCO area ""Collina Po"". The research proposed an innovative approach for enhancing peri-urban area and supporting multifunctional agricultural activity. Firstly, for identifying traditional landscape features, an historical study was performed. Ancient documents found in historical private and public archives and libraries were examined. Then, for assessing and valuing the peri-urban agroecosystem, the ecosystem services' approach was applied. For investigating the peri-urban agroecosystem, a trans-scalar approach from the farm to the landscape level was adopted. The interpretation of historical data, field observations, and farmer interviews (research data); the analysis of statistical data and the evaluation of ecosystem services (statistical data) were performed. Several parameters such as traditional productions, local agriculture tools and direct marketing/farmers markets were evaluated.

Different strategies can be used by cities to achieve this goal. We studied Paris's international call for projects (CFP), ""Les Parisculteurs"", which aims to provide public and private rooftops to urban farmers. This study seeks to examine the relevance of urban rooftop farming (URF) in the city of Paris in view of its specificities and to understand the management of the CFP which is currently an innovative way to develop urban rooftop farming. We will show how this CFP tends to respond to the city of Paris's challenges regarding UA. The comprehensive analysis of this CFP is based on the results of an 11-month participatory research work: we participated in the study and the setting up of the CFP by being part of the ""Assistant to the Contracting Authority"" (ACA), commissioned by the City of Paris. It appears, inter alia, that this CFP lifted several barriers blocking projects installations, is a way to green the city quickly and in a cost-effective way, promotes the diversity of the projects of UA and allows the City of Paris to test technical and regulatory limits of UA on existing buildings. It was also pointed out that developing UA by providing lands on rooftops without financing the winning projects had strongly encouraged the professionalization of urban agriculture in Paris. To conclude, CFP can be a relevant way for a collectivity to encourage urban farming but it cannot be a systematic solution as it is adapted to a specific context and it carries the risk to develop projects which are disconnected from their local environment",call for projects;food policy;urban rooftop farming,,,Orsini F.Gianquinto G.P.Pennisi G.Cremonini L.Georgiadis T.,International Society for Horticultural Science,05677572,9789462612129,,,English,Acta Hortic,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85056849404,3,France,France,institute agroparistech/inra umr sadapt,institute agroparistech/inra umr sadapt,aca;achieve;agriculture;agriculture ua;aims;alia;allows;analysis;assistant;authority;authority aca;barriers;buildings;call;cannot;cfp;cfp tends;challenges;cities;city;collectivity;comprehensive;comprehensive analysis;conclude;context;costeffective;costeffective way;develop project;development;different strategy;diversity;encourage;environment;examine;farmers;financing;global north;goal;innovative way;installations;inter;inter alia;international call;lands;les;limits;local environment;management;north;paris;paris challenge;parisculteurs;pariss;part;participatory;participatory research;private rooftop;professionalization;project cfp;project installation;projects;promotes;provide;public;regulatory limit;relevance;relevant;relevant way;research;research work;respond;results;risk;rooftop;rooftop farming;rooftops;seeks;several barrier;show;solution;spaces;specific context;specificities;strategies;study;study seek;systematic solution;tends;test;ua;ua development;understand;urban agriculture;urban farmer;urban farming;urban rooftop;urf;vacant;vacant space;view;way;work,agriculture;agriculture development;call;catalyst;development;paris;parisculteurs;project parisculteurs;projects;rooftops;urban agriculture,168

The number of small housing type-settlement development with no adequate garden or open space is always increase. Housing that lack of greenery has led to many problems such as bad quality of fresh air, lack of playing area for kids and mental problem. On the other side, the widespread of city development has resulted in reduced agricultural space which has led to inadequate domestic food supplies and the declining quality of food crops availability. In the wake of various issues on food and energy security, urban farming by Food Oriented Development (FOD) is a concept of urban development that can make the city as a food provider for its own citizens on an ongoing basis. This concept considers aspects of food security as well as socio-economic considerations in urban physical development. The objective of this research is to get the information of people preference of verticulture model as urban farming method in small housing type-settlement. The questionnaire survey using Likert scale is conducted to measure people perception and preference. This study explores factor analysis for decision-making process. The result indicate that people tend to choose simple and smart system of verticulture model as a vertical garden in private residential.

The food supply and the food safety are threatened and the urban agriculture could help to solve this problem. VERDIR is a global and integrated project carried by the University of Liege to contribute to the social, cultural, environmental, and economic transition in the South part of Belgium (Wallonia). Wallonia cultivates the tradition of steel and iron for centuries and inventories estimate the number of brownfields in approximately 5000, representing a total surface about 10,000 hectares. Eighty percent of these former industrial sites are situated in peri-urban and urban zones. Moreover, the active steel and iron industries reject important quantities of hot waters, hot gases, and carbon dioxide in the environment. These industrial thermal discharges represent more than 20% of the energy consumed in Wallonia. The possibilities of rehabilitating former industrial sites or the valorization of industrial thermal discharges are numerous. But, recently the urban farming and the development of plant factories have become more and more an important renovation model of brownfields offering new jobs and new industrial sectors.The VERDIR project is a new rehabilitation concept of industrial sites, which mixes the practices of urban agriculture and the production of biomass to high added value molecule.

Next to the quantification of E. coli, three household surveys (baseline, hygiene and farm) were conducted. Additionally, an observational spot-check was undertaken in bi-monthly intervals throughout the follow-up period. Significant positive differences in water quality between PoS and PoU samples were identified in 78% of households. During the monsoon, the peak of contamination, only 6% of households had access to safe drinking water at PoU. The Average Treatment Effect (ATE) of wastewater irrigation indicates an adverse effect on in-household water contamination, larger in effect size than the mitigation effect of access to sanitation or personal hygiene.

Both are enhanced by soil organic matter (SOM), which is thus particularly important for the fertility of these soils. In this study, we assessed the influence of urbanization on SOM, carbonate contents and pH of arable soils of Kumasi (Ghana, West Africa), since rapid urban sprawl is widespread in West Africa, whereby in many West African cities urban farming is pivotal to the food security of their population. Based on satellite imagery for the year 1986, we defined long-term and short-term urban arable soils, whereby long-term urban soils were urban already in 1986 (thus ≥30 years, as soil sampling took place in 2016), and short-term urban soils became urban afterwards ( &lt; 30 years). We took 618 undisturbed topsoil samples (0-10 cm) from 206 urban arable fields. The factors land-use (maize fields) and soil (Ferric Acrisols) were kept largely constant. The fine-earth was analyzed for pH (water), carbonate contents, loss on ignition (LOI), total C (TC) and N (TN). SOM contents were obtained from LOI (SOMLOI). All element contents were transformed to bulk soil element stocks per m2. Differences between short-term and long-term urban soils were identified by a set of linear mixed models. Coarse fragments were more abundant in the long-term (16%) compared to the short-term (10%) urban soils, because of solid municipal waste that accumulates over time in urban soils. TC and SOMLOI concentrations of the fine earth, pH and C/N ratios were all significantly higher in the long-term urban soils. SOC concentrations in the fine earth, as well as bulk soil stocks of TC, SOC, and SOMLOI were also higher in the long-term urban soils, but at a lower degree of confidence, due to variable bulk densities and contents of coarse fragments. We conclude that dumping of organic and inorganic waste (including ash, bones, egg shells, concrete and mortar) increases SOM stocks and soil pH, but also leads to accumulation of non-degradable solid materials (including plastic, metals etc.). These findings point to the need of an improved urban waste management system, separating degradable and non-degradable waste",ghana;household waste;soil organic matter;soil ph;tropical soils;urban farming;urbanization;west africa,,"Asabere, S.B.; Department of Physical Geography, Institute of Geography, University of GoettingenGermany; email: sasaber@uni-goettingen.de",,Frontiers Media S.A.,2296665X,,,,English,Front Environ Sci,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85055798819,4,Ghana;Germany,Germany,department of physical geography;council for scientific and industrial research,department of physical geography,abundant;accumulates;accumulation;acrisols;africa;african city;afterwards;arable field;arable soil;ash;bones;bulk;bulk density;bulk soil;c;capacity;carbonate;carbonate content;carbonate contents;cation;cation exchange;cities;city urban;cm;cn;coarse;coarse fragment;concentrations;conclude;concrete;confidence;contents;degree;densities;differences;earth;egg;egg shells;element;element content;element stock;etc;exchange;exchange capacity;factor landuse;factors;ferric;ferric acrisols;fertility;fields;findings;fine;fine earth;fineearth;food;food security;fragments;ghana;ignition;ignition loi;imagery;increase som;increases;influence;inorganic;inorganic waste;kept;kumasi;kumasi ghana;landuse;landuse maize;leads;linear;loi;loi somloi;longterm;loss;low cation;lt;m2;maize;management;management system;materials;matter;matter som;metals;mixed model;models;mortar;mortar increase;municipal waste;n;need;nondegradable waste;nutrient;nutrient content;organic matter;ph;ph water;pivotal;place;plastic;point;population;ratios;sample;sample cm;samples;satellite;satellite imagery;security;set;shells;shortterm;soc;soc concentration;soil;soil element;soil ferric;soil organic;soil ph;soil stock;soils;solid material;solid municipal;som;som content;som stock;somloi;somloi concentration;sprawl;stocks;study;system;tc;time;tn;topsoil;topsoil sample;total c;tropical soil;undisturbed topsoil;urban afterwards;urban farming;urban soil;urban sprawl;urban waste;urbanization;variable bulk;waste;waste management;water;west;west africa;whereby;year;years;≥30,africa;arable soil;carbonate;ghana;ghana west;increases;kumasi;leads;matter;matter stock;organic matter;ph;soil;soil organic;soils;stocks;urbanization;urbanization lead;west;west africa,173

The market reaction was explored by adopting economic value added (EVA) technique for the measurement of both quantitative and qualitative value contributed by green facilities. The results from this study support that there exists interaction between qualitative factors such as indirect economic benefits and social psychological benefits and quantitative factors, agricultural production and energy saving impacted by green facilities.

Findings reveal a character profile of Browne as a charming and inspirational teacher who engaged in a dominating leadership that contradicted the community of practise's ideals, creating further contradictions which resulted in disrespected students, disillusioned staff, and a founder unable to take responsibility for his leadership. Finally, I discuss the importance of addressing the power of founders so that founder’s syndrome does not impede the important work of educational nonprofits",adultism;community of practise;environmental education;founder’s syndrome;nonprofit organisations,,"Ceaser, D.K.; Sociology, California State University East Bay, 25800 Carlos Bee Blvd, United States; email: donovonc@gmail.com",,Routledge,17457823,,,,English,Ethnogr Educ,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85030853345,1,United States,United States,california state university east bay,california state university east bay,aims;attitude;browne;browne’s;browne’s leadership;character;character profile;community;contradictions;create;destroyed;discuss;disillusioned staff;educational nonprofit;egalitarian community;examine;examine browne’s;findings;founder;founders;founder’s;founder’s syndrome;green shoot;hierarchy;ideals;impede;importance;important work;inspirational teacher;john;john browne;leadership;nonprofit;nonprofit servicelearning;nonprofits;organization;outright;power;practise;practise ethic;practises;profile;responsibility;reveal;school;shoots;staff;students;subvert;syndrome;teacher;tendency;theory;urban farming;walkout;work,case;case study;community;educational community;ego;founder’s;founder’s syndrome;grow;itself’;practise;project;project itself’;study;syndrome;‘because,175

Nine barriers to urban gardening were identified: finance, space, organizational structure, water, external damage, soil, communication, interpersonal issues, and participation issues. Using process tracing and grounded theory, we found that these barriers could be divided into three groups: primary, secondary, and participation barriers. Primary barriers are caused and directly influenced by the regime, whereas secondary barriers are the result of decisions and actions taken while addressing the primary barriers. All of these barriers cause frustration and affects the ability of the gardens to retain and acquire new members.

It offers a series of incisive analyses and is replete with insights on identifying lines of effective intervention to overcome capitalist relations, including housework, care work, and the commons. As Federici identifies urban community gardening as an important development in the struggle for the commons, and thereby a postcapitalist future, I briefly discuss two general concerns that suggest caution in making more of urban community gardens than they can deliver politically. One concern is over an uncertain relationship between community, social reproduction, and commons that infuses urban community gardens. The community in the urban community gardens can be reactionary and capitalism-friendly, so that commons may not necessarily come out of such projects. Urban gardening, since it is still largely women’s work, may also impede the collectivisation of social reproduction by adding yet another set of responsibilities expected to be taken up by women. Another regards pollution problems and their under-appreciated political reverberations. Urban gardeners may be exposed to greater concentrations of toxic substances, possibly like farmworkers or miners. These imply highly uneven social consequences, as women, people of colour, and the elderly are the main urban gardeners. The health effects of prolonged exposure could also lead to greater needs for care work, which is also still mostly carried out by women.

While showing that urban gardening forges commons of varying persistence, we also demonstrate the ways through which the commons are always closely entwined with processes of enclosure.

However, school-based EE has not been successful in nurturing environmentally responsible actions in students. This is partly because of the information-oriented structure of current EE, which assumes that symbol-based knowledge directly leads to motivation and action. In contrast, educational initiatives based on practices and actions in the world, with farming as an important component, have been successful in creating transformative changes in behavior. To develop similar transformative interventions that motivate school students, it is necessary to understand the general psychological principles that make such participatory designs successful. Here we report a year-long observation study that seeks to contribute to such a general model, analyzing how farming actions changed the motivation of volunteers working in an urban community farm. We take an analysis approach inspired by recent embodied cognition models, where volunteers’ lived experiences and interactions with material entities are analyzed, to understand how motivation and values develop through such interactions. Based on this data, we propose a spiral model of motivation and action, where specific farming actions coalesce together to form motivation and values, which then seed wider environment-oriented actions in the world",community;embodied cognition;motivation;pro-environmental action;urban farming,,"Dutta, D.; Homi Bhabha Centre for Science Education, Tata Institute of Fundamental ResearchIndia; email: deborah@hbcse.tifr.res.in",,Routledge,13504622,,,,English,Environ Educ Res,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85031916306,2,India,India,homi bhabha centre for science education,homi bhabha centre for science education,action;action coalesce;actions;analysis;analysis approach;approach;assumes;behavior;changes;coalesce;cognition;cognition model;community;community farm;component;contrast;contribute;current ee;data;designs;education;education ee;educational initiative;ee;engage;entities;environment;environment education;experiences;farm;form;form motivation;general model;general psychological;important component;informationoriented structure;initiatives;interactions;interventions;key;key mandate;knowledge;leads;mandate;material;material entity;model;models;motivate;motivate people;motivate school;motivation;observation;observation study;participatory;participatory design;people;practices;principles;propose;psychological principle;report;responsible action;school;school student;seed;seed wider;seeks;similar transformative;spiral;spiral model;structure;students;study;transformative;transformative change;transformative intervention;understand;urban community;values;volunteers;volunteers’;wider;world;yearlong observation,actions;coalesce;community;community coalesce;motivations;proenvironment;proenvironment motivation;values,180

We conducted semi-structured interviews with 23 gardeners in Lausanne, Switzerland and analysed them according to their content. Three major themes emerged as motivations for gardening: wellbeing, social aspects, and outputs (both tangible, such as food, and intangible, such as the feeling of having produced food). Motivations for gardening practices were grouped into extrinsic factors, such as practical constraints, inspiration from neighbours, following regulations, and social controls; and intrinsic, which were primarily based on knowledge and experience.

In a similar way, technological solutions are also now being applied to urban farming, a practice which has gained momentum especially in large cities, to help citizens grow vegetables and the like in their own homes or establishments. Urban farming is now more important than ever in the context of the rapid urbanization and development of smart cities all over the world. It is important that residents in urban areas grow their vegetables, and it is important that they do it the right way. Only then will it be possible, in the future, to sustain ourselves in large cities and places which are not quite accessible by villages where farming is done on a large scale. In this paper, we propose a process of growing and taking care of the plants, so that maximum efficiency is guaranteed in the growth process and also information is generated and shared by the whole community. This information will help us crunch the data and arrive at better decisions. The solution works on sensors monitoring the temperature, humidity, ambient light intensity and soil moisture levels pertaining to a certain plant. These sensors are connected to a device which makes understandable data out of these sensor outputs. This then communicates with a central device which collects information from all such sensors, and displays this on a locally hosted webpage. The content is also shown on a dashboard for comfortable visualization and understanding. It also stores a database which can be referred for future analytics.

Both the semi-mass and industrial trials were performed in five steps: (1) preparation and installation of the RAS and ZWD system components; (2) preparation of microbial components including nitrifying bacteria, the microalgae Chaetoceros muelleri, and the probiotic heterotrophic bacteria Bacillus megaterium; (3) acclimatization of white shrimp post larvae from the salinity level of 32 ppt to 5 ppt; (4) conditioning of the biofilter used in the RAS and shrimp tank (microbial loop manipulation in ZWD); and (5) shrimp grow-out rearing for 84 days and 60 days for the semi-mass trial and the industrial trial, respectively. The hybrid system combined a ZWD system and an RAS. Shrimp tanks were conditioned with the addition of microbial components for ZWD at the beginning of the culture period. The RAS was operated when NH4 + and NO2 −-N levels in shrimp culture reached above 1 ppm until the levels decreased to 0–0.5 ppm. The culture performance in the semi-mass trial at 500 PL/m3, 750 PL/m3, and 1,000 PL/m3 stocking densities was not significantly different for final mean body weight (12.06 ± 5.72, 11.84 ± 3.58, 12.04 ± 3.71 g/ind, respectively) and productivity (4.205 ± 0.071, 4.691 ± 0.025, 4.816 ± 0.129 kg/m3, respectively). Significant differences in survival (70 ± 7%, 53 ± 3%, 40 ± 4%, respectively) and feed conversion ratios (1.54 ± 0.01, 1.82 ± 0.00, 2.16 ± 0.03, respectively) were observed between the three different stocking densities. Water quality parameters and microbial loads during the semi-mass trial were similar for all stocking densities and were within the tolerance levels for white shrimp grow-out production. The results of the semi-mass trial showed that the hybrid ZWD-RAS system can maintain water quality and a microbial load up to a 1,000 PL/m3 stocking density; however, the optimum performance based on survival, feed conversion ratio, and productivity was reached at the 500 PL/m3 stocking density. The industrial trial of the application of the hybrid ZWD-RAS system using the optimal stocking density of 500 PL/m3 resulted in a comparable shrimp survival of 78% with a total production of 298 kg shrimp biomass (equal to a productivity level of 2.7 kg/m3). The overall results of both the semi-mass and industrial trials showed that the application of a hybrid ZWD-RAS system allows optimal shrimp survival and growth at the stocking density of 500 PL/m3 and has high potential for application in commercial shrimp grow-out production at low salinity levels",hybrid system;industrial;litopenaeus vannamei;low salinity;recirculation aquaculture systems;super intensive;zero water discharge system,aquaculture;bacteria;bacteriology;hybrid systems;nitrification;productivity;tanks (containers);water quality;aquaculture systems;industrial;litopenaeus vannamei;low salinity;super intensive;zero-water discharge;shellfish;aquaculture production;bacterium;commercial species;crustacean;growth;intensive culture;microbial activity;recirculating system;salinity;shrimp culture;stocking density;survival;east java;gresik;indonesia;bacillus megaterium;chaetoceros muellerii;decapoda (crustacea);litopenaeus vannamei,"Suantika, G.; Microbial Biotechnology Research Group, School of Life Sciences and Technology, Institut Teknologi Bandung, Jalan Ganesha No. 10, Indonesia; email: gsuantika@sith.itb.ac.id",,Elsevier B.V.,01448609,,AQEND,,English,Aquac Eng,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85046799938,10,Indonesia,Indonesia,school of life sciences and technology;school of life sciences and technology;school of life sciences and technology;school of business and management,school of life sciences and technology,acclimatization;addition;aims;allows;application;aquaculture;aquaculture system;bacillus;bacillus megaterium;bacteria;biofilter;biomass;body;chaetoceros;commercial shrimp;comparable shrimp;components;conditioning;conditions;conversion;conversion ratio;culture;culture performance;culture period;day;days;densities;density;differences;different shrimp;different stocking;discharge;discharge zwd;east;east java;facility;feed;feed conversion;final mean;gind;gresik;growout;growout production;growout rearing;growth;heterotrophic bacteria;high potential;hybrid;hybrid system;hybrid zero;hybrid zwdras;industrial level;industrial trial;installation;java;kg;kg shrimp;kgm3;larvae;level;levels;load;loads;loop;loop manipulation;low salinity;m3;maintain;maintain water;manipulation;mean;mean body;megaterium;microalgae;microalgae chaetoceros;microbial;microbial component;microbial load;microbial loop;muelleri;nh4;no2;optimal shrimp;optimal stocking;optimization;optimum;optimum performance;optimum shrimp;overall result;parameters;part;parts;performance;period;plm3;post;post larva;ppm;ppt;preparation;probiotic heterotrophic;production;productivity;productivity level;quality;quality parameter;ra system;ras;ratio;ratios;results;salinity;salinity condition;salinity level;semimass;semimass trial;shrimp;shrimp biomass;shrimp culture;shrimp growout;shrimp post;shrimp production;shrimp survival;shrimp tank;significant difference;step;step preparation;steps;study;study aim;superintensive;survival;survival ±;system;system allows;system component;system ra;tank;tank microbial;tanks;tolerance;tolerance level;total production;total volume;trial;trials;urban farming;volume;water;water discharge;water quality;weight;white shrimp;zero;zwd;zwd system;zwdras;zwdras system;±;−n,aquaculture;aquaculture system;commercial shrimp;conditions;culture;development;discharge;east;east java;gresik;hybrid;hybrid system;indonesia;industrial trial;java;litopenaeus;litopenaeus vannamei;low salinity;ra hybrid;ras;salinity;salinity condition;shrimp;shrimp litopenaeus;super;super intensive;system;system ra;trial;urban farming;vannamei;vannamei culture;water;water discharge;white shrimp;zero,183

Growth environment chambers nowadays are employed only to improve the overall production of the plant, while paying less attention to its quality. Automated strategies can be applied to attune the existing model, making it compatible for precisely controlling the environmental factors, which are the significant effectors of changes in the metabolic pathways of secondary metabolites. Previously, MIT has developed a Personal Food Computer (PFC) to control the growth environment of plants to maintain uniformity in their production in an urban setting. However, several challenges remained untouched, especially when the PFC was used in a research setting. One such instance was that an increase in the daylight negatively impacted the level of humidity, which could be undesirable and requires manual intervention to maintain grow-condition stability. To overcome the shortcomings of the existing model we have modified MIT's PFC by implementing cloud-based flexible automation techniques along with robotics to develop a Cost-Effective Automated Food Computer (CEAFC).

In East Asia, a variety of initiatives have emerged in recent years with different levels of institutional support. Focusing on Taipei, where a vibrant urban agriculture movement has been unleashed in recent years, this article examines the ongoing outcomes of the city’s new ‘Garden City Initiative’, which supports the establishment of urban gardens including community gardens, rooftop gardens and school gardens. Based on interviews and participant observations during the initial period of advocacy, planning and implementation between 2014 and 2017, this study examines the background of the programme, the involvement of governmental and non-governmental actors and the programme’s ongoing implementation. Based on the findings, the article further reflects upon their implications for the practices of urban governance in the face of contemporary environmental, political and social challenges. The case of Taipei suggests a model in which policy formation and implementation may require opportunistic actions involving a variety of actors and organisations in both institutions and the civil society. Rather than dramatic changes or instant institutional realignment, the effort may require strategic adaptation of the existing bureaucratic structure, while mobilising its strengths and resources. In addition, despite the critical role of civil society organisations, the Taipei case also illustrates a considerable public-sector investment, distinct from the predominant model of neoliberal governance that has been associated with urban gardening programmes elsewhere",environment/sustainability;governance;local government;planning;policy;urban agriculture;urban gardens,,"Hou, J.United States; email: jhou@uw.edu",,SAGE Publications Ltd,00420980,,,,English,Urban Stud,Article in Press,Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85049832409,1,United States,United States,department of landscape architecture,department of landscape architecture,actions;actors;adaptation;addition;advocacy;agenda;agriculture;agriculture movement;article;article examines;asia;background;bureaucratic structure;case;challenges;changes;city;city initiative’;city’s;civil society;climate;climate adaptation;community;community garden;concerns;considerable publicsector;critical role;different level;distinct;dramatic change;east;east asia;effort;establishment;examines;face;findings;food;food security;formation;gardening;gardening programme;gardens;governance;governmental;illustrates;implementation;implications;initial period;initiatives;initiative’;instant;institutional realignment;institutional support;institutions;interviews;investment;involvement;levels;model;movement;neoliberal governance;new ‘garden;nongovernmental actor;observations;opportunistic action;organisations;outcomes;participant;participant observation;period;planning;policy;policy formation;practices;predominant;predominant model;programme;programmes;programme’s;publicsector;publicsector investment;realignment;recent year;require;resilience;resources;role;rooftop;school;school garden;security;social challenge;society;society organisation;strategic adaptation;strengths;structure;study;study examines;suggests;support;supports;taipei;taipei case;taipei suggests;urban agriculture;urban garden;urban gardening;urban governance;urban resilience;variety;vibrant;vibrant urban;world;years;‘garden;‘garden city,cities;city;city initiative’;gardens;initiative’;resilient;resilient city;taipei;urban garden;‘garden;‘garden city,185

He suggests a framework operating with four distinct types of political participation that apply across time and context and therefore potentially may lead to higher comparability of results in participation research. However, his map faced criticism for not accounting for digital and other recent participatory activities, and so far, it remains a theoretical endeavor that needs to prove its utility when applied to the diverse set of participatory activities. Our study empirically tests how recently emerging participatory activities, such as crowdfunding or urban gardening, can conceptually be combined with more traditional forms of participation. We use 27 participatory activities from a national survey conducted in Denmark (N = 9125) to test van Deth's framework. A confirmatory factor analysis demonstrates the existence of four distinct types of political participation, based on the sphere, the target, and the intention of activities. Our model furthermore indicates that the distinction between online and offline activities has decreased in relevance and that new and unconventional participation activities can be subsumed under van Deth's four types of political participation",cfa;civic engagement;digital networked participation;political participation;unconventional participation,,"Ohme, J.; University of Southern DenmarkDenmark; email: ohme@journalism.sdu.dk",,Palgrave Macmillan Ltd.,00016810,,,,English,Acta Polit,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85025840111,3,Denmark;Netherlands,Denmark,university of southern denmark;university of amsterdam,university of southern denmark,accounting;acta;acta polit;activities;activity challenge;analysis;analysis demonstrates;attempts;challenge;comparability;confirmatory;confirmatory factor;consolidate;context;criticism;demonstrates;denmark;denmark n;deth;deths;developed;digital;distinct;distinct type;distinction;diverse;diverse set;endeavor;existence;factor;factor analysis;forms;framework;framework operating;gardening;indicates;intention;lead;map;model;model furthermore;n;national survey;needs;networked;offline;offline activity;online;operating;participation;participation activity;participation research;participatory;participatory activity;polit;political participation;previous attempt;prove;recent participatory;relevance;remains;research;results;set;study;suggests;survey;target;test;test van;tests;theoretical endeavor;time;traditional form;types;unconventional activity;unconventional participation;urban gardening;use;use participatory;utility;van;van deth,conceptual map;deths;map;participation;participation research;political participation;practice;research;theory;van,186

However, it could also generate numerous opportunities. Specifically, in the context of wastewater, nutrients, energy and water could be mined from it. Because of its exceptionally high nitrogen (N) and phosphorous (P) concentration, human urine is particularly suitable to be processed for fertiliser production. In the present study, forward osmosis (FO) was employed to mine the P and N from human urine. Two Mg2+-fertilisers, i.e. MgSO4 and Mg(NO3)2 were selected as draw solution (DS) to dewater synthetic non-hydrolysed urine. In this process, the Mg2+ reverse salt flux (RSF) were used to recover P as struvite. Simultaneously, the urea was recovered in the DS as it is poorly rejected by the FO membrane. The results showed that, after concentrating the urine by 60%, about 40% of the P and 50% of the N were recovered. XRD and SEM – EDX analysis confirmed that P was precipitated as mineral struvite. If successfully tested on real urine, this process could be applied to treat the urine collected in urban areas e.g., high-rise building. After the filtration, the solid struvite could be sold for inland applications whereas the diluted fertiliser used for direct fertigation of green walls, parks or for urban farming. Finally, reduction in the load of N, P to the downstream wastewater treatment plant would also ensure a more sustainable urban water cycle",fertiliser draw solution;forward osmosis;nitrogen recovery;phosphorous recovery;urine treatment,body fluids;fertilizers;filtration;nitrogen;osmosis;phosphorus;recovery;source separation;tall buildings;urea;wastewater treatment;draw solutions;forward osmosis;nitrogen recovery;phosphorous recovery;urine treatment;magnesium compounds;fertilizer;magnesium derivative;magnesium sulfate;nitrogen;phosphorous acid;struvite;urea;nitrogen;phosphorus;concentration (composition);hydrological cycle;nitrogen;osmosis;phosphorus;precipitation (chemistry);urban area;urine;wastewater treatment plant;article;environmental sustainability;filtration;osmosis;scanning electron microscopy;urban area;urine;waste water treatment plant;water cycle;x ray diffraction;agriculture;chemistry;human;isolation and purification;procedures;waste water;water management;agriculture;fertilizers;filtration;humans;nitrogen;osmosis;phosphorus;struvite;urine;waste water;water purification,"Kyong Shon, H.; School of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Technology, Sydney (UTS), City Campus, Broadway, Australia; email: Hokyong.Shon-1@uts.edu.au",,Elsevier Ltd,00456535,,CMSHA,29635160.0,English,Chemosphere,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85047431009,7,Saudi Arabia;Australia;South Korea,Australia,school of civil and environmental engineering;school of urban and environmental engineering;king abdullah university of science and technology (kaust),school of civil and environmental engineering,analysis;application whereas;applications;approach;area e;areas;building;challenges;concentration;context;cycle;dewater;direct fertigation;downstream;downstream wastewater;draw;draw solution;ds;e;edx;edx analysis;energy;fertigation;fertiliser;fertiliser production;filtration;flux;flux rsf;fo;g;generate;green wall;high nitrogen;highrise;highrise building;human;human urine;i;inland;inland application;load;major challenge;membrane;mg2;mg2 reverse;mg2fertilisers;mgno32;mgso4;mine;mineral;mineral struvite;n;nitrogen;nitrogen n;nonhydrolysed urine;numerous opportunity;nutrients;opportunities;osmosis;osmosis fo;p;p concentration;parks;phosphorous p;plant;present;present study;process;production;real urine;recover;recover p;reduction;results;reverse;reverse salt;rsf;salt;salt flux;sem;sem –;society;solid struvite;solution;solution d;struvite;study;sustainable society;treat;treatment;treatment plant;urban area;urban farming;urban water;urea;urine;walls;waste;wastewater;wastewater treatment;water;water cycle;whereas;xrd;–;– edx,application;drawn;drawn forward;fertiliser;fertiliser drawn;nitrogen;nitrogen recovery;novel;novel application;osmosis;recovery;urine,187

According to the United Nations, urban areas are expected to absorb most of this population growth over the next four decades. With the world number of urban inhabitants estimated to grow from the present 3.9 billion to 6.3 billion people by 2050, the vast majority of this surplus will be living in slums with inadequate or non-existent water, health or sanitation systems. Today more than 156 million urban dwellers, live without immediate access to water. In places like Mumbai India, where the average yearly humidity is of 75%, the problem of water scarcity can be solved with minimal infrastructure with the use of atmospheric water generators. There are 3.1 quadrillion gallons of water in the atmosphere at any given time. While the average humidity in your home or office is 50%, an atmospheric water generator can produce water from humidity as low as 35%. This means in a place like Mumbai, a single atmospheric water generator can produce up to 5000 litters of water a day. The production of this amount of water in multiple locations within a slum has the potential to solve the water crisis by producing clean, filtered, free, accessible water and by doing so eliminating health and sanitation issues. The proposed project in this paper will address the use of this technology while at the same time using it to solve nutrition problems in the same slums by serving also as a water resource for urban farms designed to produce fruits, vegetables and mushrooms in the same structure that houses the atmospheric water generator. The proposed tower will grow hydroponic produce within the slum, cutting transportation and packaging costs. The idea is to create a network of interdependent facilities that directly serve large numbers of people through a process of urban acupuncture producing services that require minimal maintenance and the possibility of creating local jobs while helping solve the water and food crisis in slums in the developing world",atmospheric water generator;developing world;hydroponics;sustainability;urban acupuncture;urban farming;water,atmospheric structure;developing countries;housing;population statistics;sanitation;sustainable development;urban growth;van de graaff generators;water;water resources;atmospheric water;developing solutions;developing world;hydroponics;population growth;sanitation systems;urban farmings;world population;atmospheric humidity,"Cerro, C.; College of Architecture, Art and Design, American University of SharjahUnited Arab Emirates; email: ccerro@aus.edu",,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9781538623992,,,English,"Adv Sci Eng Technol Int Conf, ASET",Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85049969663,1,United Arab Emirates,United Arab Emirates,college of architecture,college of architecture,absorb;access;accessible water;acupuncture;address;amount;areas;atmospheric water;average humidity;cities;clean;costs;create;crisis;day;decades;dwellers;facilities;farms;first time;food;food crisis;fruits;gallons;generator;generators;grow;grow hydroponic;growth;half;health;history;home;houses;humidity;hydroponic;hydroponic produce;idea;immediate;immediate access;inadequate;india;infrastructure;inhabitants;interdependent;interdependent facility;issues;jobs;large number;litter;litters;lives;living;local job;locations;maintenance;majority;means;minimal;minimal infrastructure;minimal maintenance;multiple;multiple location;mumbai;mushrooms;nations;network;nonexistent;nonexistent water;number;numbers;nutrition;nutrition problem;office;packaging;packaging cost;paper;people;place;places;population;population growth;population life;possibility;present;problem;problems;process;produce;produce fruit;produce water;production;project;quadrillion;quadrillion gallon;require;require minimal;resource;sanitation;sanitation issue;sanitation system;scarcity;serve;services;single atmospheric;slum;slums;solve;solve nutrition;structure;surplus;systems;technology;time;today;tower;towns;transportation;united nation;urban acupuncture;urban area;urban dweller;urban farm;urban inhabitant;use;vast;vast majority;vegetables;water;water crisis;water generator;water resource;water scarcity;world;world history;world number;world population,atmospheric water;farm;farm tower;food;food scarcity;generator;scarcity;scarcity atmospheric;solutions;tower;urban farm;water;water generator,188

The article begins by introducing the practice and perception of the illegal (“wild”) gardens that have existed in Zagreb on vacant and derelict plots for decades. A discussion of the changing contexts of urban gardening within the last few years follows.

A growing literature on peri-urban farming characterises its dynamics and quantifies urban pressure and farmland consumption by urban sprawl. However, such research requires expensive surveys and comprehensive databases that are usually inaccessible to planners and public-policy analysts. This paper presents an analytical framework for peri-urban farmland characterisation that is operational for public action. Based on in-depth analysis of a Mediterranean local case study using surveys, on-site landscape reading, remote sensing analysis and interviews, we classed peri-urban farming into spatial units of peri-urban agriculture (USAPU). The classification obtained over seven municipalities was later used to train a fractional regression model, which was then tested on the rest of this French departement (similar to NUTS-3 level), to predict the presence and actual proportion of each USAPU in the total agricultural land of each municipality. Furthermore, we drew up categories of municipality according to USAPU distribution that open perspectives for public action on peri-urban farming. We discussed whether such a model could be used as an instrument for decision-making on food planning, rather than simply for fairly reliable future predictions.

Considering the increase in urban population and land consumption in the last decades, sustainability in peri-urban areas is a priority. Farming multifunctionality is the integration of different functions and activities that produce beneficial effects on local economy, environment and society. Three research questions were explored: How is multifunctionality applied in peri-urban agroecosystems? How do we ensure sustainability in peri-urban agroecosystem? How could a bottom-up approach promote sustainable actions, strategies and policies? The Chieri Municipality (Turin Metropolitan Area, Italy) was chosen as representative case study. A trans-scalar approach from the farm to the municipality levels was adopted. The analysis of statistical data and farmers' interviews were performed. Multifunctionality for three main farm categories (crops and grasslands; vineyards and orchards; and horticulture) was explored using the following parameters: website presence, online selling, agritourism, didactic farms, nonagricultural activities, maintenance parks and gardens, renewable energy, and transformation. According to the different farm types, multifunctionality assumes different aspects covering specific sets of sustainability needs. We consider important to move from the farm level multifunctionality to the landscape level multifunctionality in order to provide all services at a territorial scale. As a result, the following perspectives and strategies were proposed: increasing rural farm networks and cooperation, promoting initiates for valorizing the local food products, including farms in touristic and cultural networks, and involving farmers in social and didactic programs. In conclusion, this methodology could be applied for decision makers and planners for implementing a participatory approach in environmental-social and economic programs for peri-urban areas",agroecosystem;farms;interviews;landscape planning;participatory approach,agricultural ecosystem;bottom-up approach;landscape planning;methodology;metropolitan area;participatory approach;periurban area;questionnaire survey;strategic approach;sustainability;urban population;italy;piedmont [italy];torino [piedmont];turin,"Larcher, F.; Department of Agricultural, Forest and Food Sciences, University of Turin, Largo Paolo Braccini 2, Italy; email: federica.larcher@unito.it",,MDPI AG,20711050,,,,English,Sustainability,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85047127601,3,Italy,Italy,department of agricultural;research centre for rural development of hilly,department of agricultural,actions;activities;agriculture;agriculture play;agritourism;agroecosystem;agroecosystems;analysis;approach;approach promote;area;areas;aspects;assumes;beneficial effect;bottomup;bottomup approach;case;case study;categories;category crop;chieri;chieri municipality;chosen;conclusion;consumption;cooperation;crops;cultural network;data;decades;decision;decision maker;didactic farms;didactic program;different aspect;different farm;different function;economic program;economy;effects;energy;environment;environmental function;europe;farm;farm category;farm level;farm network;farm type;farmer interview;farmers;farms;food;food product;functions;gardens;grasslands;horticulture;increase;initiates;integration;interviews;italy;key;key role;land;land consumption;landscape;landscape level;landscapes;last decade;level;level multifunctionality;levels;local economy;local food;main farm;maintenance;maintenance park;makers;methodology;metropolitan;metropolitan area;move;multifunctionality;multifunctionality assumes;municipality;municipality level;municipality turin;needs;networks;nonagricultural activities;online;online selling;orchards;order;parameter website;parameters;parks;participatory;participatory approach;periurban;periurban agroecosystem;periurban agroecosystems;periurban area;periurban landscape;perspectives;planners;plays;policies;population;presence;priority;produce;products;programs;promote;provide;questions;renewable energy;representative;representative case;research;research question;result;role;rural farm;scale;services;sets;society;specific set;statistical data;strategies;study;sustainability;sustainability need;sustainable action;territorial;territorial scale;transformation;transscalar;transscalar approach;turin;turin metropolitan;types;urban population;vineyards;website;website presence,area;area italy;case;case study;italy;metropolitan;metropolitan area;multifunctionality;periurban;periurban farming;study;sustainability;turin;turin metropolitan,193

Furthermore, gardens provide a wide range of ecosystem services, including carbon (C) storage and nutrient cycling. Although the soil is the foundation of sustainable gardens providing those ecosystem services, very little is known about the consequences of garden management on soil quality. Here we present a comprehensive assessment of urban garden soil quality, including biotic and abiotic site characteristics combined with land-use history and garden management information in a multivariate evaluation. A set of 44 soil quality indicators was measured at 170 sites of 85 gardens in the city of Zurich, Switzerland, comprising contrastingly managed garden habitats along a gradient of urban density. Taken together, our results show that garden management was the driving factor that influenced soil quality and soil functions. Eco-physiological soil quality indices were useful to identify differences in disturbance and intensity of soil use, showing highest microbial [microbial biomass (Cmic)/soil organic carbon (SOC)] and lowest metabolic (qCO2) quotients in perennial grass sites compared to annual vegetable sites. Despite the intensity of soil disturbance in annual vegetable and flower beds, the highest endogeic earthworm biomass and diversity were found in those habitats. Whereas decomposition of green tea bags was higher in grass sites. Soil heavy metal contents varied considerably and could not be linked with garden management practices, but with spatial patterns of industry and traffic. We conclude that understanding soil quality in urban ecosystems needs multi-indicator frameworks to capture the complexity of soil characteristics and the influencing factors in space and time. This study contributes to a better understanding of urban gardens and enhances the development of sustainable soil management strategies aimed at long-term improvement of soil quality and related ecosystem services in cities",cmic/soc;earthworms;qco2;soil quality indicators;tea bag index;urban ecology theory;urban ecosystem services;urban gardening,,"Tresch, S.; Functional Ecology Laboratory, Institute of Biology, University of NeuchatelSwitzerland; email: tresch.simon@gmail.com",,Frontiers Media S.A.,2296665X,,,,English,Front Environ Sci,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85046687841,7,Switzerland,Switzerland,institute of biology;department of soil sciences;swiss federal research institute wsl;department of biology;department of environmental system science,institute of biology,abiotic site;animal;animal specie;annual vegetable;assessment;bags;beds;belowground;biodiversity;biomass;biomass cmicsoil;c;capture;carbon;carbon c;carbon soc;characteristics;cities;city;cmicsoil;cmicsoil organic;complexity;comprehensive;comprehensive assessment;conclude;consequences;contents;contributes;cycling;decomposition;density;development;differences;disturbance;diversity;earthworm;earthworm biomass;ecophysiological soil;ecosystem;ecosystem need;ecosystem service;ecosystems;endogeic;endogeic earthworm;enhances;evaluation;factor;factors;flower;flower bed;found;foundation;frameworks;functions;garden;garden habitat;garden management;garden provide;garden providing;garden soil;gardens;gradient;grass;grass site;green tea;habitats;heavy metal;history;hot spot;identify difference;improvement;indicators;indices;industry;information;intensity;landuse;landuse history;longterm;longterm improvement;management;management information;management practice;management strategy;many plant;metabolic;metabolic qco2;metal;metal content;microbial;microbial biomass;microbial microbial;multiindicator;multiindicator framework;multivariate;multivariate evaluation;need multiindicator;needs;nutrient;nutrient cycling;organic carbon;patterns;perennial;perennial grass;plant;practices;present;provide;provide habitat;qco2;qco2 quotient;quality;quality index;quality indicator;quotients;range;related ecosystem;result show;results;services;set;show;site;sites;soc;soil;soil characteristic;soil disturbance;soil function;soil heavy;soil management;soil quality;soil use;space;spatial pattern;species;spots;storage;strategies;study;study contributes;sustainable garden;sustainable soil;switzerland;tea;tea bag;time;traffic;understanding soil;urban biodiversity;urban density;urban ecosystem;urban garden;use;varied;vegetable;vegetable site;whereas;wide range;zurich,gardener influence;gardeners;influence;quality;soil;soil quality;urban soil,194

Some U.S. cities, at least in the Northeast, had food-raising and processing practices not just in colonial times but up until the relatively recent past. Three areas of history are explored that have mostly omitted discussion of city food production but nonetheless provide important frameworks to explore such production: urban development, agricultural, and immigrant history. Woven throughout this piece is evidence from a study of Waterbury, Connecticut. Local food production did not die when the Industrial Revolution came to Waterbury. Farms and other food-producing, processing, and marketing operations remained and even adapted to the growing city’s needs and resources. The city government both supported and undermined agriculture in ways that add to an understanding of urban history and are lessons for current urban agriculture policy",agricultural history;connecticut;urban agriculture;urban development history;urban farming;waterbury,agricultural history;agricultural policy;food production;marketing;urban agriculture;urban development;urban history;connecticut;united states,"Glasser, R.99 East Main St, United States; email: ruth.glasser@uconn.edu",,SAGE Publications Inc.,00961442,,,,English,J Urban Hist,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85045954107,1,United States,United States,university of connecticut,university of connecticut,agriculture;agriculture policy;areas;cities;city;city food;city government;city’s;colonial;colonial time;connecticut;current urban;development;die;dimension;discussion;evidence;explore;farms;food;food production;frameworks;government;history;immigrant;immigrant history;important framework;industrial revolution;journalistic literature;lessons;literature;local food;marketing;marketing operation;needs;new phenomenon;northeast;operations;past;phenomenon;piece;policy;practices;processing;processing practice;production;production urban;provide;recent past;resources;revolution;s;study;times;treats;u;undermined agriculture;urban agriculture;urban development;urban history;waterbury;ways,city;farm;historiography;inclusive urban;past;past thought;recent past;thoughts;urban historiography,197

Consequently, methods for its quantification require validation with historically contaminated soils. In this study, 35 such soils were obtained from various locations in Switzerland and Cuba. They were exposed to different pollution sources (e.g., pyrogenic and petrogenic) at various distance (i.e., urban to rural) and were subject to different land use (e.g., urban gardening and forest). Passive equilibrium sampling with polyoxymethylene was used to determine freely dissolved concentrations (Cfree) of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), while sorptive bioaccessibility extraction (SBE) with silicone rods was used to determine the bioaccessible PAH concentrations (Cbioacc) of these soils. The organic carbon partition coefficients of the soils were highest for skeet soils, followed by traffic, urban garden and rural soils. Lowest values were obtained from soil exposed to petrogenic sources. Applicability of SBE to quantify Cbioacc was restricted by silicone rod sorption capacity, as expressed quantitatively by the Sorption Capacity Ratio (SCR); particularly for soils with very high KD. The source of contamination determined bioaccessible fractions (fbioacc). The smallest fbioacc were obtained with skeet soils (15%), followed by the pyrogenically influenced soils, rural soils, and finally, the petrogenically contaminated soil (71%). In conclusion, we present the potential and limitations of the SBE method to quantify bioaccessibility in real soils. These results can be used for additional development of this and similar bioaccessibility methods to guarantee sufficient sorption capacity to obtain reliable results. Freely dissolved concentrations and bioaccessible fractions of PAHs in soils depended on pollutant source and site characteristics, while the sink capacity was limiting during bioaccessibility extractions of soils with low PAH content and high KD values",bioavailability;pah;passive sampling;sbe;sink capacity;soil,"acetal resins;aromatic compounds;aromatic hydrocarbons;biochemistry;carbon;contamination;extraction;hydrocarbons;land use;organic carbon;organic pollutants;pollution;polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons;risk assessment;silicones;soils;sorption;bioavailability;carbon partition coefficients;freely dissolved concentration;passive sampling;polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pahs);sink capacity;site characteristics;sorption capacities;soil pollution;acenaphthene;acenaphthylene;anthracene;benzo[a]pyrene;benzo[b]fluoranthene;benz[a]anthracene;chrysene;dibenz[a,h]anthracene;fluoranthene;fluorene;indeno[1,2,3 cd]pyrene;naphthalene;organic carbon;phenanthrene;polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon;pyrene;silicone;polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon;aromatic hydrocarbon;bioavailability;concentration (composition);extraction method;organic pollutant;pah;particulate organic carbon;risk assessment;sampling;soil pollution;source-sink dynamics;article;clinical assessment;concentration process;cuba;depletion;equilibrium constant;forest;gardening;land use;law;quality control;risk assessment;rural area;soil pollution;solvent extraction;sorptive bioaccessibility extraction;switzerland;urban area;analysis;bioavailability;environmental monitoring;pharmacokinetics;pollution;procedures;soil pollutant;cuba;switzerland;biological availability;cuba;environmental monitoring;environmental pollution;polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons;risk assessment;soil pollutants;switzerland","Bucheli, T.D.; Agroscope, Environmental Analytics, Reckenholzstrasse 191, Switzerland; email: thomas.bucheli@agroscope.admin.ch",,Elsevier Ltd,00456535,,CMSHA,29453067.0,English,Chemosphere,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85042286590,6,Switzerland;Denmark;Cuba,Switzerland,department of environmental system science;centro nacional de sanidad agropecuaria (censa);danmarks tekniske universitet,department of environmental system science,additional development;applicability;aromatic hydrocarbon;assessment;bioaccessibility;bioaccessibility extraction;bioaccessibility method;bioaccessible fraction;bioaccessible pah;capacity;capacity ratio;carbon;carbon partition;cbioacc;cfree;characteristics;coefficients;complement;concentration cbioacc;concentration cfree;concentrations;conclusion;contamination;content;cuba;determine;development;different land;different pollution;distance;e;equilibrium;extraction;extraction sbe;extractions;fbioacc;forest;fraction fbioacc;fractions;g;garden;gardening;guarantee;guarantee sufficient;high kd;hydrocarbon pahs;hydrocarbons;kd;kd value;land;land use;legislation;limitations;locations;low pah;measurements;method;methods;organic carbon;organic pollutant;pah;pah concentration;pah content;pahs;partition;partition coefficient;passive;passive equilibrium;petrogenic;petrogenic source;pollutant;pollutant source;pollutants;pollution;pollution source;polycyclic;polyoxymethylene;present;pyrogenic;quantification;quantification require;quantify bioaccessibility;ratio;ratio scr;real soil;reliable result;require;require validation;results;risk;risk assessment;rod;rod sorption;rods;rural soil;rural soils;sbe;sbe method;scr;silicone;silicone rod;similar bioaccessibility;sink;sink capacity;site;skeet;skeet soil;soil;soils;sorption;sorption capacity;sorptive;sorptive bioaccessibility;source;source e;sources;study;subject;sufficient;sufficient sorption;switzerland;total concentration;traffic;urban garden;urban gardening;use;use e;validation;values;various distance;various location,aromatic hydrocarbon;bioaccessibility;bioaccessibility extraction;equilibrium;extraction;fulldepletion;fulldepletion bioaccessibility;hydrocarbon;nodepletion;nodepletion equilibrium;polycyclic;soils,198

Our literature review shows that urban gardens provide opportunities for physical activity and allow people to consume homegrown fruit and vegetables. Urban gardens may also reduce stress levels of gardeners and improve social cohesion. In this way, they can help to prevent health problems. Good quality of urban soil and the functioning of soil ecosystems are indispensable prerequisites for these. We developed a framework that shows how ecosystem health and human health are interconnected in urban gardening, by placing it in the context of urban green space management and valuation. This study yields a set of indicators, which can be used to assess soil ecosystem services and health impacts. They may provide a basis for the evolving dialogue in decision-making processes and partnership activities in urban management. Recognizing the potential effects and discussing what is important to whom, might be enough to find synergies. Importantly, the initiators of urban gardens are often citizens, who seek support from other stakeholders. The social network established by gardens may contribute to health-enabling, cohesive communities involved with their living environment. To maximize health benefits, it is useful to make the urban gardens accessible to many people.

Issues addressed include impacts of population growth and development, loss of agricultural lands, and impacts of climate change on agriculture and rural communities. Conclusions are supported by stakeholder survey data, geographic information systems-based data, and desktop reviews of research journal publications. We propose a sustainable, diversified approach that supports mitigation of issues, including increasing demand on food production and decline of rural communities. A key issue that we address is where we will find suitable landscapes to reduce enough food for 9.6 billion people living in 2050. Urban and rural development planners are grappling with solutions to escalating impacts global populations, stresses on food production, and effects of climate change. Solutions are identified, including strengthening rural and urban contexts by establishing connected and interdependent links that support diversification of rural and urban contexts as viable solutions to these issues. Diversified rural-to-urban sustainable agriculture production is a promising approach to addressing climate change impacts. Organic agriculture principles exhibit strong diversity and are accredited by United States Department of Agriculture as the only federally certified sustainable agriculture practice in the United States. Sustainable agriculture practices are evolving into profitable diversified alternative food sources.

It shows that urban agriculture is an important source of revenue for various individuals and groups, and a socio-political arena for state representatives, experts and farmers. The main stakes in these power relationships are the regulation, control and use of natural resources (especially water and land), but also residents’ nutrition and health interests. Public authorities produce and monitor the enforcement of legal standards of water use and hygiene, while farmers struggle individually and collectively to ensure efficient use of land and multiple water sources, sometimes challenging official norms. These competing interests lead sometimes to conflicts – over the use of the resources or the legitimacy of rules that regulate urban farming processes – that are negotiated through institutional or informal bargaining.

Yet urban agriculture is an incredibly diverse and variable field of study, and many practical aspects remain overlooked and understudied. This paper explores the economic sustainability of urban agriculture by focusing on the physical, practical, and economic aspects of home food gardens in South Australia. New data from the Edible Gardens project online survey is presented on a broad range of current garden setups, including a figure illustrating the statistically typical South Australian food garden. The differences between the survey data and a recent optimized garden model further highlight the gap in knowledge regarding existing home food gardens. With regard to the financial accessibility and economic sustainability of home food gardens, there is also still much more work to be done. Although saving money is a top motivation, with many survey respondents believing that they do succeed in saving money, it remains to be seen whether their current gardening practices support this aspiration.

Previous study proved that urban farming can help to address social problems of food security, urban poverty and high living cost, also provides leisure and recreation among urban dwellers. Thus, this study investigates the best urban farming practices suitable for urban setting, environment and culture of urban dwellers. Data collection was done via questionnaire survey to urban farmers of a selected community garden in Subang Jaya, Selangor. Meanwhile, on-site observations were carried out on gardening activities and the gardens' physical attributes. The study sample encompasses of 131 urban farmers of 22 community gardens in Subang Jaya. It was found that most of the community gardens practiced crops planting on the ground or soil base planting and dwellers in the lower income group with monthly low household income constitutes the majority (83.2%) of the respondents. Social and health benefits are the highest motivating factors for urban farmers.

The aim of this new system is to motivate the general public to participate more in waste prevention programs. The Composter- Henhouse (CH) is a compact facility comprised of a henhouse and three composters. This is shared by 30 families who provide the organic part of their kitchen waste to feed the hens. Hens help speed up the composting process by depositing their droppings and turning the organic residue into compost. This study assesses the CH in terms of treatment capacity, the technical adequacy of the composting process, the quality and safety of the compost obtained and some social aspects. Over three years, the CH has managed nearly 16.5 tons of organic waste and produced approximately 5600 kg of compost and more than 6000 high-quality fresh eggs. No problems or nuisances have been reported and the level of animal welfare has been very high. The follow up of the composting process (temperature, volume reduction and compost maturity) and a physicochemical and microbiological analysis of the compost have ensured the proper management of the process.

This paper attempts to subvert this approach by reflecting on the emerging culture of small scale ecological farming in Shanghai. Such farms have been growing in number since 2000, driven largely by the availability of land and an increasing demand for safe and healthy food. While being a rational productivist response to a market opportunity, however, these farms reflect a break with conventional farming, in terms of their size, location and new farmer identities, as well as their socio-cultural relationships with customers and local communities. Using a survey of 45 such farms, the paper illustrates how and where new forms of farming, and the alternative food networks that they support, are colonizing the city. While being redolent of the growth in urban farming in many western cities, farming in Shanghai is driven by private individuals with personal and family, as well as broader community, motives. This suggests that while Shanghai may be experiencing the growth of alternative forms of what might be understood as civic agriculture, those involved are not primarily interested in the civilizing mission ascribed to many such movements. Rather, the new farms are hybrid service businesses in which the sales and marketing skills of the new farmers have allowed them to transform individual customers into members of food networks who form mutual co-dependent trust relationships that underpin the survival of the farms. Perhaps as a result of this, and despite strong demand for organic food, these new farms face a marginal existence in which business development is constrained as much by the strength and continuity of their food networks as it is by the quality and quantity of food that they can grow",geographic map;new farmer;shanghai;small scale organic farming,agricultural economics;agricultural worker;business development;food quality;local economy;organic farming;small scale industry;urban agriculture;china;shanghai,"Liu, P.; Dept. of Environmental Science and Engineering, Fudan University, 220 Handan Road, Yangpu, China; email: pyliu@fudan.edu.cn",,Elsevier Ltd,00167185,,,,English,Geoforum,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85044843768,3,United Kingdom;China,China,fudan university;center for land and resource economics studies;school of the environment and technology,fudan university,agricultural geography;agriculture;alternative;alternative food;alternative form;approach;ascribed;attempts;availability;break;broader;business;business development;businesses;cities;city;civic;civic agriculture;codependent;codependent trust;communities;community;continuity;conventional farming;culture;customers;demand;development;driven;ecological farming;economic paradigm;emerging culture;existence;face;family;farm;farm face;farm reflect;farm type;farmer;farmer identity;farmers;farms;food;food network;form;forms;geography;global market;grow;growth;healthy food;hybrid;hybrid service;identities;illustrates;individual customer;individuals;land;local community;location;marginal existence;market;market opportunity;marketing;marketing skill;markets;members;mission;motives;movements;mutual codependent;networks;new farm;new farmer;new form;number;opportunity;organic food;paper;paper attempt;paper illustrates;paradigm;private individual;productivist;productivist response;products;quality;quantity;rational productivist;redolent;reflect;relationships;response;result;sales;scale;service;service business;shanghai;size;skills;small scale;sociocultural relationship;strength;strong demand;subvert;suggests;support;survey;survival;terms;transform;transform individual;trust;trust relationship;types;underpin;understood;urban farming;western city,agricultural geography;geography;shanghai,208

ZEAL is designed to be used in agricultural applications for wireless sensor networks. In these type of applications, all data is often routed to a single point (named ""sink"" in sensor networks). The overuse of the same routes quickly depletes the energy of the nodes closer to the sink. In order to minimize this problem, ZEAL automatically creates zones (groups of nodes) independent from each other based on the trajectory of one or more mobile sinks. In this approach the sinks collects data queued in sub-sinks in each zone. Unlike existing protocols, ZEAL accomplish its routing tasks without using GPS modules for location awareness or synchronization mechanisms. Additionally, ZEAL provides an energy saving mechanism on the network layer that puts zones to sleep when there are no mobile sinks nearby. To evaluate ZEAL, it is compared with the Maximum Amount Shortest Path (MASP) protocol. Our simulations using the ns-3 network simulator show that ZEAL is able to collect a larger number of packets with significantly less energy in the same amount of time",ns-3 simulator;precision agriculture;protocols;routing protocols;urban farming;wireless sensor networks,agriculture;data acquisition;energy conservation;network layers;network protocols;power management;precision agriculture;routing protocols;sensor nodes;wireless sensor networks;data collection;data collection protocols;energy saving mechanism;location awareness;network simulators;shortest path;synchronization mechanisms;urban farmings;power management (telecommunication),,,"Institute of Electronics, Information and Communication, Engineers, IEICE",09168516,,ITRCE,,English,IEICE Trans Commun,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85042668961,4,Japan,Japan,graduate school of information science and engineering;college of information science and engineering,graduate school of information science and engineering,accomplish;agricultural application;amount;applications;approach;aware data;awareness;closer;collect;collect data;collection;collection zeal;collects;creates;data;depletes;energy;evaluate;evaluate zeal;gps;gps module;groups;layer;le energy;location;location awareness;masp;masp protocol;maximum;maximum amount;mechanism;mechanisms;mobile;mobile sink;modules;network;network layer;network simulator;networks;nodes;ns3;ns3 network;number;order;overuse;packets;paper;path;path masp;point;problem;propose;protocol;protocols;puts;routes;sensor;sensor network;shortest;show;simulations;simulator;simulator show;single point;sink;sink collect;sink nearby;sinks;sleep;subsinks;synchronization;synchronization mechanism;tasks;time;trajectory;type;wireless;wireless sensor;zeal;zeal protocol;zone;zone group;zones,aware data;collection;collection protocol;data;energy;protocol;wsns,209

In Africa, it can contribute to food security and poverty reduction. Often associated with urban gardening, and urban livestock, there is a gap of knowledge on the urban production of aromatic and medicinal plants. This production is present in Ziguinchor, Senegal, where the study has been conducted. The objective of this article is to describe this form of urban agriculture in order to evaluate its environmental and socioeconomic services. The method is based on mapping of agricultural sites in the city, and on a survey of 70 producers. The results show that these micro-farms are localized in urban interstices. The land tenure is based on free leases, from landowners who can take back their land at any time. The cultivated species are Mentha spicata L., Mentha X piperita L. and Ocimum basilicum L. The cultivation of these plants is the work of women who get a significant income. These revenues are mainly intended for the purchase of food and the schooling of children. In addition to reducing poverty, these micro-farms contribute to the sanitation of the city, considering the fertilization coming from waste and animal manure. Mints have other properties, in particular medicinal, underestimated by the producers.

Functions of contemporary urban gardens are part of a new urban paradigm: caring for the environment, rediscovering social interaction and reconnecting with nature. At the same time we are witnessing the emergence of temporary urbanism within urban space involving the provisional usage of unused spaces for a wide range of activities. It allows for the transformation of traditional categories (e.g. gardens, parks) into a hyper contemporary category of urban space that contains desirable characteristics such as availability, mobility, re-use and temporality, i.e. urban gardens that sprout or ‘pop up’ as part of civil society initiatives or festival events. Temporary urbanism and pop-up gardens are considered through allotment gardens in Croatia. They present the revival of urban agriculture and are explored in relation to their polyfunctional character that addresses economic, ecological and social questions. Returning to the statement thatcontemporary urban gardens are part of a new urban paradigm and bearing in mind the bipolarity of urban gardening, the research analyses the attitudes of students of architecture towards the concept, usage and design of urban gardens in several operational categories such as temporary-permanent, amateur-professional, bottom-up vs. top-down approach, space-place.

Demographic changes that affect both the epidemiology of brucellosis and the success of control or surveillance are also considered. The evidence suggests that brucellosis prevalence in emerging peri-urban dairy cattle systems may be higher than that found in traditional transhumant extensive systems. Accurate microbiological and epidemiological evidence across the region is lacking but it appears there is inherent interest in controlling the disease.

In this context, the paper studies the character of three of Belgrade's urban gardens and their contribution to the quality of everyday life in the large-scale socialist residential settlements built during the 1970s. Focus is placed on establishing relations between the dwelling culture, social and cultural needs and changes, and the dominant architectural and planning paradigms of modernism and post-modernism. Belgrade's urban gardens were created and developed spontaneously (most often non-legally) as self-organized citizens’ acts. Research presented in our case studies confirms the paper's initial assumption that the urban gardens in Belgrade are still considered marginal and certainly not representative urban practices, overshadowed by the planned urban conceptions and socio-political actions. In this sense, we may notice the lack of a systematic approach to managing these gardens, and complete absence of legislation either provided by authorities, private or public bodies or even associations. Although the urban gardens emerged in socialism outside of any rules and regulations, they promoted the values of an active relationship between the user, dwelling culture and immediate residential surroundings, and contributed to improving the dwelling culture of the “new working class” in the socialist dwelling units. Also, the gardens were not only a place for producing food in financially difficult times, especially during the post-socialist transition of the 1990s, but above all a place associated with socialization and a “sense of home”. Recognizing the benefits of urban gardens and accordingly raising awareness about this concept in the city, together with the adoption of appropriate regulations, would certainly be of immense relevance to urban gardening and generally landscape quality in Serbia",allotments;everyday spatiality;greenery;non-legal practices;residential settlements;serbia,architectural design;garden;greenspace;human settlement;legislation;quality of life;residential location;socialism;spatial analysis;urban ecosystem;urban planning;belgrade;serbia,"Ristic Trajkovic, J.; University of Belgrade - Faculty of Architecture, Bulevar kralja Aleksandra 73 / IISerbia; email: arch.jelena.ristic@gmail.com",Dewaelheyns V.Jakobsson A.Saltzman K.,Elsevier GmbH,16188667,,,,English,Urban For Urban Greening,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85020174158,5,Serbia,Serbia,university of belgrade − faculty of architecture;university of belgrade − institute for multidisciplinary research,university of belgrade − faculty of architecture,1970s;absence;actions;active relationship;acts;adoption;approach;appropriate;appropriate regulation;associations;assumption;authorities;awareness;belgrade;belgrade urban;belgrades;benefits;bodies;built;case;case study;changes;character;citizens’;citizens’ act;city;class”;complete absence;concept;conceptions;concepts;confirms;considers;context;contribution;cultural need;culture;developed;difficult time;dominant;environment;everyday;everyday life;focus;food;gardening;gardens;home”;immediate;immense;immense relevance;important role;initial assumption;lack;landscape;landscape quality;largescale;largescale socialist;legislation;life;modernism;nature;needs;notice;paper;paper considers;paper study;papers;paradigms;place;planning;planning paradigm;postmodernism;postsocialist;postsocialist transition;practices;public;public body;quality;regulations;relations;relationship;relevance;representative;representative urban;research;residential settlement;residential surroundings;role;rules;sense;serbia;settlement built;settlements;socialism;socialist;socialization;sociopolitical action;spaces;studies;study confirms;surroundings;systematic approach;times;transition;units;urban conception;urban environment;urban garden;urban gardening;urban practice;user;values;“new;“sense,belgrade;culture;garden;gardening;gardening practice;informal gardening;postsocialist;postsocialist belgrade;practices;socialist;space;space informal;urban garden,213

One form of urban agriculture is self-harvest gardening where participants can lease a plot in a field with various vegetables. However, in Western Europe, little is known about self-harvest garden participants and providers or their motivation and social background. Therefore, in 2015 a survey was conducted with 173 participants and 34 providers from different regions and cities in Germany. The study aimed to compile a self-characterization of people engaged in this form of gardening on a national level. The outcome of the survey captures an emerging phenomenon. While many of the self-harvest gardens can be assigned as grassroot initiatives, participants generally characterized themselves as having a middle or high income, a sustainable lifestyle, high level of education and high nutritional awareness. Disproportionally often, females were engaged in self-harvest gardening. Providers were mainly farmers with a high affinity to organic agriculture. Often the farmers had synergistic effects with other activities like farm shops. Location of the garden area, good support by the providers, promotional marketing and social activities were identified as factors for successful self-harvest gardens. The main incentive for the participants seem to be their engagement in the production of local and healthy food, which can be taken into account by the providers when considering their future focus. On the other hand, problems with bad harvest, theft and vandalism were challenges for some self-harvest gardens. While, legal problems were not a major concern for the providers.

Urban planners and agricultural leaders have argued that cities will need to produce food internally to respond to demand by increasing population and to avoid paralyzing congestion, harmful pollution, and unaffordable food prices. The paper examines urban agriculture as a solution to these problems by merging food production and consumption in one place, with the vertical farm being suitable for urban areas where available land is limited and expensive. Luckily, recent advances in greenhouse technologies such as hydroponics, aeroponics, and aquaponics have provided a promising future to the vertical farm concept. These high-tech systems represent a paradigm shift in farming and food production and offer suitable and efficient methods for city farming by minimizing maintenance and maximizing yield. Upon reviewing these technologies and examining project prototypes, we find that these efforts may plant the seeds for the realization of the vertical farm. The paper, however, closes by speculating about the consequences, advantages, and disadvantages of the vertical farm's implementation. Economic feasibility, codes, regulations, and a lack of expertise remain major obstacles in the path to implementing the vertical farm",advanced cultivation methods;efficient food production;innovative technologies;sustainability;urban population increase,,"Al-Kodmany, K.; Department of Urban Planning and Policy, College of Urban Planning and Public Affairs, University of Illinois at ChicagoUnited States; email: kheir@uic.edu",,MDPI AG,20755309,,,,English,Buildings,Review,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85042510423,1,United States,United States,department of urban planning and policy,department of urban planning and policy,advances;advantages;aeroponics;agricultural leader;agriculture;aquaponics;areas;available land;avoid;avoid paralyzing;cities;city;city farming;closes;codes;concept;congestion;consequences;consumption;demand;disadvantages;discusses;economic feasibility;efficient;efficient method;efforts;emissions;examines;expertise;expertise remain;farm;farm concept;farm implementation;farmland;farmland shortages;farms;feasibility;food;food miles;food price;food production;food security;future;gas;gas ghg;ghg;ghg emission;greenhouse;greenhouse gas;greenhouse technology;growth;harmful;harmful pollution;hightech;hightech system;hydroponics;implementation;issues;lack;land;leaders;maintenance;major obstacle;methods;miles;need;obstacles;offer;paper;paper discus;paper examines;paradigm;paradigm shift;path;place;planners;plant;pollution;population;population growth;prices;problems;produce;produce food;production;project;project prototype;promising;promising future;prototypes;realization;recent advance;regulations;remain;represent;respond;security;seeds;shift;shortages;solution;system represent;systems;technologies;unaffordable food;urban agriculture;urban area;urban planner;urban population;vertical farm;yield,city;developments;farm;implications;review;vertical city;vertical farm,216

Urban greening, including urban gardening, has experienced a resurgence of interest. Within the frame of the compact city, the meanings, forms and functions of urban gardening have been re-evaluated for their contribution to urban sustainability, turning those spaces into a contested subject of negotiation. This qualitative study, conducted in the Swiss cities of Basle, Berne, Geneva and Zurich, investigates how the meanings of urban gardening are discursively (re)produced in political negotiation processes and how different rationalities of space produce a hegemonic order, constructing urban gardening sites as contested spaces.

In Puerto Rico, data currently is limited on As and Pb levels in urban garden soils, soil metal (loid) bioaccessibility, and uptake of As and Pb in soil by edible plants grown in the region. This study examined total and bioaccessible soil As and Pb concentrations and accumulation in 10 commonly grown garden plants collected from three urban community gardens in Puerto Rico. Bioavailability values were predicted using bioaccessibility data to compare site-specific bioavailability estimates to commonly used default exposure assumptions. Total and bioaccessible As levels in study soils ranged from 2 to 55 mg/kg and 1 to 18 mg/kg, respectively. Total and bioaccessible Pb levels ranged from 19 to 172 mg/kg and 17 to 97 mg/kg, respectively. Measured bioaccessibility values corresponded to 19% to 42% bioaccessible As and 61% to 100% bioaccessible Pb when expressed as a percent of total As and Pb respectively. Predicted relative percent bioavailability of soil As and Pb based on measured bioaccessibility values ranged from 18% to 36% and 51% to 85% for As and Pb respectively. Transfer factors (TFs) measuring uptake of As in plants from soil ranged from 0 to 0.073 in the edible flesh (fruit or vegetable) of plant tissues analyzed and 0.073 to 0.444 in edible leaves. Pb TFs ranged from 0.002 to 0.012 in flesh and 0.023 to 0.204 in leaves. Consistent with TF values, leaves accumulated higher concentrations of As and Pb than the flesh, with the highest tissue concentrations observed in the culantro leaf (3.2 mg/kg dw of As and 8.9 mg/kg dw of Pb). Leaves showed a general but not statistically-significant (α = 0.05) trend of increased As and Pb concentration with increased soil levels, while no trend was observed for flesh tissues. These findings provide critical data that can improve accuracy and reduce uncertainty when conducting site-specific risk determination of potential As and Pb exposure while gardening or consuming garden produce in the understudied region of Puerto Rico",arsenic;bioaccessibility;lead;plant uptake;puerto rico;transfer factors;urban gardening,,"Nelson, C.; U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Research and Development, 109 TW Alexander Drive, Research Triangle Park, United States; email: nelson.clay@epa.gov",,MDPI AG,20763263,,,,English,Geosciences,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85041050026,6,United States,United States,oak ridge institute for science and education (orise) research participant;u.s. environmental protection agency;u.s. environmental protection agency,oak ridge institute for science and education (orise) research participant,accumulation;accuracy;arsenic;assumptions;bioaccessibility;bioaccessibility data;bioaccessibility value;bioaccessible pb;bioaccessible soil;bioavailability;bioavailability estimate;bioavailability value;community;community garden;compare;compare sitespecific;concentration;concentrations;concern;consistent;contaminants;critical data;culantro;culantro leaf;data;default;default exposure;determination;dw;edible flesh;edible leaf;edible plant;estimates;exposure;exposure assumption;factor tfs;factors;findings;flesh;flesh fruit;flesh tissue;fruit;garden;garden plant;garden produce;garden soil;gardening;gardens;grown;lead;lead pb;leaf;leaves;levels;loid;loid bioaccessibility;metal;metal loid;mgkg;mgkg dw;pb;pb concentration;pb exposure;pb tfs;percent;percent bioavailability;plant;plant grown;plant tissue;plants;produce;provide;puerto;puerto rico;region;relative;relative percent;rico;risk;risk determination;sitespecific;sitespecific bioavailability;sitespecific risk;soil;soil level;soil metal;soils;statisticallysignificant;statisticallysignificant α;study;study soil;tf;tf value;tfs;tfs measuring;tissue;tissue concentration;tissues;transfer;transfer factor;trend;uncertainty;understudied region;uptake;urban community;urban garden;urban gardening;values;vegetable;α,arsenic;bioaccessible soil;community;community garden;gardens;lead;lead level;levels;plant;plant uptake;puerto;puerto rico;rico;soil;soil arsenic;uptake;urban community,218

However, relatively little attention has been paid to date to the growing medium of green roofs, i.e., Technosols. A better understanding of the influence of Technosols and the link with ecosystem services is required in order to maximize the environmental benefits of urban rooftop farming. Between March 2013 and March 2015, a pilot project called T4P (Parisian Productive rooftoP, Pilot Experiment) was conducted on the rooftop of AgroParisTech University. Urban organic waste was used, and results were compared with those obtained using a commercial potting soil, based on yield and trace metal concentrations, substrate characterization, and the amount of leaching. An assessment of the ecosystem services expected from the Technosols was undertaken in terms of the output of food (food production and quality), regulation of water runoff (quantity and quality), and the recycling of organic waste. Indicators of these ecosystem services (e.g., yield, annual loss of mass of mineral nitrogen) were identified, measured, and compared with reference cases (asphalt roof, green roof, and cropland). Measured yields were almost equivalent to those obtained from horticultural sources in the same area, and the Technosols also retained 74–84% of the incoming rainfall water. This is the first quantitative analysis of ecosystem services delivered by urban garden rooftops developed on organic wastes, and demonstrates their multifunctional character, as well as allowing the identification of trade-offs. An ecosystem services approach is proposed for the design of soil-based green infrastructure of this kind and more generally for the design of sustainable urban agriculture",ecosystem services;green infrastructure;green roof;productive rooftop;technosol;urban farming;urban garden;urban waste,alternative agriculture;ecosystem service;greenspace;organic pollutant;quantitative analysis;recycling;roof;runoff;sustainable development;trace metal;urban area;urban development;waste management,"Grard, B.J.-P.; UMR Ecosys, AgroParisTech, INRA, Universite Paris SaclayFrance; email: claire.chenu@inra.fr",,Springer-Verlag France,17740746,,,,English,Agron Sustainable Dev,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85038898809,6,France,France,universite paris saclay;universite paris-sud;universite paris saclay;universite paris saclay,universite paris saclay,agriculture;agroparistech;agroparistech university;amount;analysis;annual loss;approach;area;asphalt;asphalt roof;assessment;attention;benefits;case asphalt;cases;challenges;character;characterization;commercial potting;concentrations;cropland;date;demonstrates;design;developed;development;development worldwide;e;ecosystem;ecosystem service;environmental benefit;equivalent;experiment;food;food food;food production;g;garden;garden rooftop;genuine;genuine opportunity;green infrastructure;green roof;horticultural source;i;identification;indicators;influence;infrastructure;kind;link;literature;little attention;loss;march;mass;media;medium;meet;metal;metal concentration;mineral;mineral nitrogen;multifunctional;multifunctional character;nitrogen;opportunity;order;organic waste;output;paid;parisian productive;pilot;pilot experiment;pilot project;production;productive rooftop;project;quality;quantitative;quantitative analysis;quantity;rainfall;rainfall water;reference;reference case;regulation;results;roof;roofs;rooftop;rooftop farming;rooftops;runoff;runoff quantity;scientific literature;service approach;service e;services;soil;sources;substrate;substrate characterization;t4p;t4p parisian;technosols;terms;topic;trace;trace metal;tradeoffs;university;urban agriculture;urban development;urban farming;urban garden;urban organic;urban rooftop;waste;wastes;water;water runoff;worldwide;yield;yields,ecosystem;ecosystem service;many ecosystem;rooftop;rooftop farming;services;urban waste;waste,219

Using ethnographic and interview data, we focus on the actors involved, their relationship with authority and the wider impact of their activities; exploring their motives, aspirations, values and beliefs. The results reveal the ability of the informal movement to regenerate ‘forgotten’ space and bring communities together, and the ‘darker’ side of the activity, with actors sometimes restricting access to colonised land.

It explores the characteristics of different food growing and urban gardening scenarios regarding the inherent properties of the urban agriculture/food growing complex as an urban movement, its drivers and the niche that it occupies within the city. The papers address circumstances of food growing in highly developed western planning systems, typically represented in Europe, but also other global regions which show different historical and development contexts. These demonstrate that urban food growing initiatives are largely activist-led and tend to fall outside of, or conflict with current city planning models. Where these initiatives are incorporated, they have the potential to provide effective urban landscape solutions that respond to local circumstances, new markets, engendering social and environmental improvement.

The extant literature describes it as a critical source of household food, a trend that is intertwined with such factors as declining incomes of urban households, high rates of urbanization, and a need to serve an emerging niche market in African cities. However, the literature indicates that the practice does not play a major role in Southern Africa. Triangulating research methods and methodologies, and critically examining the literature, this paper argues that peri-urban agriculture is a viable livelihoods response to the complex challenge of feeding a burgeoning mass of urban residents amidst declining food production. The paper concludes that the apparent lack of political will necessary to promote peri-urban agriculture is reflected in weak or absent policy frameworks, resulting from enormous capacity deficit. African states must be able to balance the need to preserve physical esthetics of the cityscape with the promotion of peri-urban agriculture needed to mitigate the negative impacts of changes resulting from the changing urban landscape. African cities need the capacity to develop and implement policies that foster ecologically sound peri-urban agriculture, including appropriate land use reforms",agriculture;capacity development;peri-urban areas;policymaking;southern africa;urban planning,,"D’Alessandro, C.; Sciences-PoFrance; email: cristina.dalessandro@wanadoo.fr",,Routledge,19376812,,,,English,Afr Geogr Rev,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84990192303,3,France;United States;Ethiopia,France,,,absent;absent policy;africa;african city;african state;agriculture;amidst;apparent;apparent lack;appropriate;appropriate land;argues;balance;capacity;capacity deficit;challenge;changes;cities;city need;cityscape;common phenomenon;complex challenge;concludes;critical source;deficit;describes;enormous capacity;esthetics;extant;extant literature;factors;food;food production;foster;frameworks;high rate;household;household food;households;impacts;implement;implement policy;incomes;indicates;lack;land;land use;landscape;literature;literature describes;livelihood response;livelihoods;major role;market;mass;methodologies;methods;mitigate;need;negative impact;niche;niche market;paper;paper argues;paper concludes;periurban;periurban agriculture;periurban farming;phenomenon;physical esthetic;play;policies;policy;policy framework;practice;preserve;production;promote;promote periurban;promotion;rates;reforms;research;research method;resident amidst;residents;response;role;serve;sound;sound periurban;source;southern africa;states;trend;urban household;urban landscape;urban resident;urbanization;use;use reform;viable livelihood,africa;africa miracle;agriculture;miracle;mirage;periurban;periurban agriculture;southern africa,223

The assessment of the potential of sustainable urban food supply was in the focus of the present investigation, having as investigation scale the city of Magdeburg in Saxony-Anhalt, Germany. Scope of the investigation was the feasibility assessment of implementation options as well as the perception of the consumers. Following systems were investigated for Magdeburg: urban farming, vertical farming and aquaponics. In terms of the use of urban spaces were considered roof farming, land recycling, as well as the refurbishment of former farms and greenhouses. The feasibility analysis was supported by an option analysis regarding the potential for the use of renewable energies. The results show that even the consumers are willing to pay for organic food, but there are too few sustainable, organic and local urban food products on the market yet. The needed energy for modern urban farming projects is still high in climate areas like the north of Germany. New technologies and the assessment of renewable energy source potential for urban food production is a site specific decision, which might ensure the support of the operational cost of the urban food production systems",sustainable urban food production;urban agriculture;urban gardening,,"Schneider, P.; Hochschule Magdeburg-Stendal (FH), University of Applied Sciences Magdeburg-Stendal, Breitscheidstraße 2, Germany; email: petra.schneider@hs-magdeburg.de",,Springer,21997373,,,,English,World Sustain Ser,Book Chapter,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85071456790,4,Germany,Germany,university of applied sciences magdeburg-stendal,university of applied sciences magdeburg-stendal,analysis;approach;aquaponics;areas;assessment;bioeconomy;city;climate;climate area;comparison;consumers;conventional farming;cost;decades;decision;energies;energy;energy source;farming project;farms;feasibility;feasibility analysis;feasibility assessment;focus;food;food product;food production;food supply;former farm;frame;germany;greenhouses;implementation;implementation option;increase;investigation;investigation scale;land;last decade;local urban;magdeburg;market;modern urban;new technology;north;operational cost;option;option analysis;options;organic farming;organic food;pay;percentage;perception;present;present investigation;production;production system;products;projects;refurbishment;renewable energy;result show;results;roof;roof farming;saxonyanhalt;scale;scope;show;site;site specific;source;source potential;spaces;specific decision;supply;support;sustainability;sustainability potential;sustainable food;systems;technologies;terms;urban farming;urban food;urban space;use;vertical farming,city;food;food production;germany;medium;medium scale;production;scale;scale city;urban food,224

The problems that require innovations are today often complex environmental problems. Socially seen, environmental problems are solved through the development of resilient and sustainable social and economic systems. We integrate the controversially discussed ideas of resilience and sustainability in the broader framework of coupled social-ecological systems for the analysis of special forms of agriculture in urban areas. Technical innovations need to be matched with political, economic or civil society action of many actors, institutions or social groups. The social processes of development and change show that innovations require change or transformation of social behaviour of certain social groups and actors with different interests and aims.

However, although demand is constantly rising and urban gardening is being marketed in many ways, a vast majority of the urban population still has no access to gardening and its various benefits. While community gardening projects in Europe are usually viewed as temporary, self-organised bottom-up initiatives on public or abandoned private land, this case study of the Roda-Roda pilot project shows that community gardening can develop and persist even when favourable conditions for grassroots community gardens are lacking. The vast green spaces separating residential blocks (Abstandsgrun) commonly found in Vienna’s municipal housing (Wiener Gemeindebau) have a huge spatial potential for gardening, along with a forgotten tradition of self-organisation. Using an action research approach, this paper describes two principles for a successful implementation strategy under difficult conditions. Starting with a top-down approach, an interdisciplinary project team implemented a spatial and socio-economic framework that offered a stable basis for participatory community-building. As they “climbed” the ladder of participation stepwise – from exclusion to decision-making and true self-organisation – gardeners gained knowledge, skills and the self-confidence required to run a garden and create a well-working local community. At a more general level, the paper brings a co-creative planning perspective to the scientific discussion on community gardening in Europe and offers a practical approach to making local gardening opportunities available to suitable target groups by tapping into unused spatial potential",ladder of participation;open space planning;pilot project;social housing;urban gardening,garden;participatory approach;public space;social housing;terrain;urban area;urban planning;urban population;austria;vienna,"Mayrhofer, R.; Department of Landscape, Spatial and Infrastructure Sciences, University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences, Peter-Jordan-Straße 65, Austria; email: rita.mayrhofer@boku.ac.at",,Routledge,13549839,,,,English,Local Environ,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85056141955,1,Austria,Austria,department of landscape,department of landscape,abstandsgrun;access;action;action research;approach;austria;basis;benefits;block abstandsgrun;blocks;bottomup;bottomup initiative;brings;case;case study;cocreative;cocreative planning;community;community garden;community gardening;conditions;create;demand;describes;difficult condition;discussion;europe;exclusion;favourable condition;forgotten;forgotten tradition;found;framework;garden;gardeners;gardening;gardening opportunity;gardening project;gardens;gemeindebau;general level;grassroots;green space;groups;housing;housing wiener;huge spatial;implementation;implementation strategy;initiatives;interdisciplinary project;knowledge;ladder;land;last ten;level;local community;local gardening;majority;many way;municipal housing;new significance;offers;opportunities;paper;paper brings;paper describes;participation;participation stepwise;participatory;persist;perspective;pilot;pilot project;planning;population;practical approach;principles;private land;project;project show;project team;projects;public;research;research approach;residential block;rodaroda;rodaroda pilot;scientific discussion;selfconfidence;selforganisation;selforganisation –;shows;significance;skills;socioeconomic framework;spaces;spatial potential;stable basis;stepwise;stepwise –;strategy;study;successful implementation;suitable target;target;target group;team;ten;topdown;topdown approach;tradition;true selforganisation;unused spatial;urban gardening;urban population;various benefit;vast;vast majority;vienna;vienna’s;vienna’s municipal;ways;wiener;wiener gemeindebau;years;–;– gardener;“climbed”,community;community garden;context;gardens;housing;lessons;municipal housing;participation;participation process;planning;process;terrain;terrain –;transdisciplinary planning;untapped terrain;vienna;–,227

For the second goal, geographical mapping and analysis of data relating to the spatial distribution of allotment gardens were used. For the third goal, mapping together with analysis of semi-structured interviews carried out in community gardens in Prague were used. The analysis showed a strong tradition of urban agriculture and urban food gardening activities in Czechia. Both allotment gardens and newly emerged community gardens were concentrated mainly in the biggest cities and in areas with a rich industrial and mining tradition. This finding supports the significance of gardening as an important element of urban agriculture. However, uncertainty regarding land tenure and long-term sustainability were among the greatest obstacles for the future of allotment and community gardens.

Purpose: The purpose of this study was to explore student and parent experiences with Jones Valley Teaching Farm (JVTF), a Birmingham-based 501 (c)(3) nonprofit that sponsors evidence-based activities through school-based urban farming. Methodology/Approach: The research team used a descriptive case study method to conduct semistructured focus group interviews with 33 students and 25 parents. Findings/Conclusions: Findings revealed multiple ways in which school-based urban farms fostered school connectedness by promoting positive relationships, enhancing students’ social-emotional growth, and providing students with opportunities to engage in hands-on, experience-based learning. Implications: This study provides important lessons about the value of offering highly interactive and engaging activities to underserved students and families.

The paper analyses the Berlin case study Himmelbeet and its relation to the concept of critical placemaking (Toolis, 2017) and placemaking principles of Madden and Schwartz (1999). Design/methodology/approach: The study is based on participatory action research. It examines one specific case study in Berlin where the author volunteered for several years. The set of placemaking principles is used as an ex-post analysis tool to evaluate how the community garden meets the criteria of placemaking. Findings: The paper shows that the urban community garden can be considered as a placemaking scheme although it was not planned with placemaking instruments. The garden’s placemaking process shows strategies to challenge issues of exclusion, disinvestment and depoliticization of public spaces and thus exemplifies the possibilities of citizen-controlled placemaking processes. Originality/value: The paper links placemaking with urban community gardens by assessing the placemaking principles and discussing the criteria of critical placemaking. The paper also contributes to a better understanding of urban community gardens in relation to current trends of austerity and urban inequalities",civic engagement;community garden;neighbourhood;participatory action research;public space;urban agriculture,,"Karge, T.; Institute of Urban and Regional Planning, Technische Universitat BerlinGermany; email: karge@tu-berlin.de",,Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.,17538335,,,,English,J Place Manage Dev,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85046090923,1,Germany,Germany,institute of urban and regional planning,institute of urban and regional planning,action;action research;aims;analyses;analysis;analysis tool;austerity;author;berlin;berlin case;case;case study;challenge;challenge issue;community;community garden;concept;contributes;criteria;critical placemaking;current trend;depoliticization;designmethodologyapproach;disinvestment;evaluate;examine;examine urban;examines;exclusion;exemplifies;expost;expost analysis;findings;garden;garden meet;gardens;garden’s;garden’s placemaking;himmelbeet;inequalities;instruments;issues;links;madden;meets;originalityvalue;paper;paper aim;paper analysis;paper link;paper show;participatory;participatory action;perspective;planning;possibilities;principles;process;process show;processes;public;public space;purpose;relation;research;scheme;schwartz;set;several year;show strategy;shows;spaces;specific case;strategies;study;study himmelbeet;tool;toolis;trends;urban community;urban inequality;urban planning;years,berlin;case;case study;gardening;himmelbeet;himmelbeet case;study;urban gardening,233

This paper explores the adaptive reuse potential of a specific type of building from the mid-20th century Modern Movement that was born out of necessity: the inner-city parking structure. Some of these large garages occupy very central and precious land. However, the potential of adapting them to different functions and todaỳ s environmental expectations can be challenging. The transformation of these increasingly redundant garages is inherently challenged through the need for new mixed-use typologies. Besides the immense embodied energy contained in these structures, there are also other criteria that need to be considered: local community concerns suggest that it is important to retain them as elements of the identity of place, guiding the decision-making process of adaptive reuse versus demolition. While the authors investigated new use potential of up-cycling, local stakeholders and social organisations clearly indicated the role of urban farming in future cities. In the context of increasing density, technologically advanced farming installations are seen as a viable solution for retrofitting car-parking structures, including robotic hydroponics, where vegetables grow in water enriched with nutrients and minerals. The comparative multiple-site case study of car-parking structures strategically selected in 3 UK cities (Portsmouth, Bristol and Brighton) conducted through literature review, interviews, surveys, field observation and visual research will serve as a preparation for future Urban Living Labs to reuse multi-storey parking structures as a local secondary food source",,decision making;food supply;garages (parking);decision making process;design and development;field observations;literature reviews;multi-storey parking;parking structure;viable solutions;visual research;urban growth,,Koselj N.Tostoes A.,Docomomo,,9789899964549,,,English,"Proc Int Docomomo Conf - Metamorphosis: Continuity Change, IDC",Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85055698244,2,United Kingdom;Poland,Poland,ST Architekci;university of portsmouth,ST Architekci,adaptive reuse;advanced farming;authors;born;brighton;bristol;building;carparking structure;case;case study;century;century modern;challenged;cities;city portsmouth;community;community concern;comparative;comparative multiplesite;concern suggest;concerns;context;criteria;demolition;density;design;development;different function;elements;energy;environmental expectation;expectations;explores;field;field observation;food;food source;forces;functions;future;future city;garage occupy;garages;grow;hydroponics;identity;immense;innercity;innercity parking;installations;interviews;issues;labs;land;large garage;literature;literature review;living;living lab;local community;local secondary;local stakeholder;mid20th;mid20th century;minerals;mixeduse;mixeduse typology;modern movement;movement;multiplesite;multiplesite case;multistorey;necessity;need;new mixeduse;new use;nutrients;observation;occupy;organisations;paper;paper explores;parking;parking structure;place;portsmouth;precious land;preparation;process;redundant;redundant garage;relevant;research;response;retain;reuse;reuse multistorey;reuse potential;reuse versus;review;robotic hydroponics;role;secondary food;serve;social organisation;solution;source;specific type;stakeholders;structure;structures;study;suggest;surveys;todaỳ;transformation;transport;type;typologies;uk;uk city;urban farming;urban living;use;use potential;vegetable grow;vegetables;versus;versus demolition;viable solution;visual research;water,adaptive reuse;car;car parking;cases;food;food supply;innercity;innercity car;local food;obsolete;obsolete innercity;parking;parking structure;reuse;reuse potential;structures;supply;supply uk;uk;uk case;urban farming,234

In addition, very few protected and invasive species were registered in our study. Polish urban gardeners are attached to traditional food and ornamental plants (core repertoire), but they also show a moderate interest in novel plants (peripheral fashion).

Drawing from Martin Heidegger’s notion of poiesis and Henri Lefebvre’s definition of urbanization, we elaborate on the ways that global urbanization controlled by neoliberal forces is challenged through a poetic urban agricultural tactic, namely agripoetics, an opposition to scientific and quantitative thinking of mass production for the sake of efficiency and profit. Agripoetic resistance overcomes one of the most controversial challenges of urban society—the impossibility to shape itself through the shape of its cities.

Failure in route selection could increase shipping and operating costs, and also could reduce the product's quality. Itt is necessary to obtain the right route to distribute products that could reduce operational costs and maintain the quality of product until the destination. This research develops an application to determine the distribution route for urban agricultural products using genetic algorithms.

Many urban gardens are established, organized, and managed collectively as commons. Particularly in developed countries, these community gardens (a subset of urban gardens) emerge not only in response to a lack of locally produced food, but also in response to a lack of democratic use of public spaces or missing opportunities and time for socializing. They then give rise to social networks that fulfil various social functions. Although community gardens are often listed as examples of commons, they have thus far lacked closer scientific examination. Hence, we present criteria to explore and categorize community gardens as commons by their degree of collectivity. This is based on five components: resource system, infrastructure, resource units, work, social time. We classify these criteria further according to various styles of use, ranging from individual use to sharing. To demonstrate the utility of this model we implement a quantitative study of community gardens located in one of the most urbanized area in Germany, the Rhine-Ruhr Agglomeration. Our results show a high diversity of collective use and the importance of sharing immaterial components in sustaining community gardens, notably social values. We can empirically demonstrate that gardeners develop diverse ways of collective action and social interaction to manage and change their urban environment. To aid in thinking about these issues, we provide an initial typology of community gardens according to their relative degrees of collectivity, reflecting the underlying values of these alternative agricultural system",categorizing system;collective action;commons;community gardens;rhine-ruhr agglomeration;urban agriculture,,,,"Igitur, Utrecht Publishing and Archiving Services",18750281,,,,English,Int J Common,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85054487451,2,Germany,Germany,department of agricultural;department of food nutrition facilities,department of agricultural,action;agglomeration;agricultural system;aid;alternative;area;become;categorize;categorize community;change;classify;closer;collective;collective action;collective use;collectivity;commons;community;community garden;component resource;components;countries;criteria;degree;degrees;democratic use;demonstrate;developed;developed country;diverse;diverse way;diversity;emerge;environment;examination;examples;explore;food;fulfil;functions;garden emerge;gardeners;gardening;gardens;germany;hence;high diversity;immaterial component;implement;importance;individual use;infrastructure;initial typology;interaction;international movement;issues;lack;manage;model;movement;networks;opportunities;present;present criterion;provide;public;public space;quantitative;quantitative study;relative;relative degree;resource;resource system;resource units;response;result show;results;rhineruhr;rhineruhr agglomeration;rise;scientific examination;show;social function;social interaction;social network;social time;social value;spaces;study;styles;subset;system;time;typology;units;urban environment;urban garden;urban gardening;urbanized area;use;utility;values;various style;ways;work,agglomeration;common community;commons;community;community garden;gardens;germany;rhineruhr;rhineruhr agglomeration,240

The present work shows an alternative to the use of compost obtained from the treatment of the organic fraction of municipal solid waste mixed with polystyrene and limestone to replace substrata for urban agriculture and agricultural use. The study included analysis of follow-up questionnaires answered by customers of a composting facility who mix it with other materials to produce substrata for cultivation of vegetables and ornamental plants. From this analysis, mixtures recommended by producers were tested, selecting those with the best results. Then, they were reformulated for comparison with commercial substrata used in urban and protected agriculture through an experimental design of randomized complete block design (RCBD). The experimental tests were performed on specimens of roses and tomatoes subjected to four different treatments. Nutritional properties of the substrate and productivity were evaluated under controlled conditions in a greenhouse. The results show that the proposed biophysical substratum presents physical, chemical, and biological properties that make it a viable substitute for use in urban gardening or protected agriculture. These findings contribute to increase the use of compost as a basis for the development of agricultural substrates, while reducing the environmental impact associated with the extraction of forest soil commonly used in gardening, as well as promoting the possibility of developing more affordable products with better productivity results",bioinoculants;farm inputs;sustainability;valuation of solid waste,composting;environmental impact;experimental design;forest soil;municipal solid waste;ornamental species;plant;sustainability;urban agriculture;vegetable;waste disposal;lycopersicon esculentum;rosa,"Perez Fernandez, A.R.; Universidad Tecnologica Fidel Velazquez, Emiliano Zapata, el Trafico, Mexico; email: utfv.ambiental@gmail.com",,"Centro de Ciencias de la Atmosfera, UNAM",01884999,,RCAME,,Spanish,Rev Int Contam Ambient,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85051229569,5,Mexico,Mexico,universidad tecnologica fidel velazquez;universidad iberoamericana,universidad tecnologica fidel velazquez,affordable product;agricultural substrate;agricultural use;agriculture;alternative;analysis;basis;biological property;biophysical substratum;block;block design;chemical;commercial substrata;comparison;complete block;compost;conditions;contribute;cultivation;customers;design;design rcbd;development;different treatment;disposal;disposal problem;environmental impact;experimental;experimental design;experimental test;extraction;facility;findings;followup;followup questionnaire;forest;fraction;gardening;greenhouse;impact;increase;limestone;materials;mix;mixtures;need;nutritional property;order;organic fraction;ornamental;ornamental plant;plants;polystyrene;possibility;present;present work;presents;problems;produce;produce substrata;producers;productivity;productivity result;products;properties;questionnaires;randomized complete;rcbd;result show;results;roses;show;shows;soil;soil commonly;solid waste;solve;specimens;study;subproducts;substitute;substrata;substrate;substrates;substratum;substratum present;tests;tomatoes;treatment;treatments;urban agriculture;urban gardening;use;vegetables;viable substitute;waste;waste disposal;work;work show,aggregates;agriculture;biophysical substrate;compost;solid waste;substrate;urban agriculture;waste,241

One of the potential solutions to solve this problem is by bringing food production nearer to the cities. In the past decade, vertical farming has caught our attention as an innovative system to produce food in a high amount with little land space. However, the existing systems are only limited to a certain type of crops. The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the potential vertical farming systems for cultivating the climbing food plants using hydrophobic green material. This is a review article presenting selected literature investigating vertical farming capability, natural fiber-based hydrophobic green material, and potential manufacturing processes of hydrophobic green materials. The results include determination components on the vertical farming systems for climbing food plant, potential natural fiber based on the hydrophobic green material preparation, and potential mass manufacturing of green materials to support vertical farming concept in urban cities.

Almost 75% type of house in Malaysia is apartment. A major problem living in condominium and apartment is the limited space to do farming activity. Today's users do not know where their food comes from and uncontrolled using pesticide among the farmers. Over 80% of food supplies were imported and local crops products were exported. About 65% from a person salary is for food consumption. The existing design of hydroponic system is not suitable for the current lifestyle needs. This help users to farm within a limited space in the urban area and create awareness the importance of planting their own food. Hydroponic system can reduce 40% of living cost for food. The compact rack system design has been proposed based on the functionality and practicality for crops planting in a small area using deep water culture system. The compact rack design using a simple system that can easy to assemble and disassemble that suit home interior.

On the contrary, the main stream of research is focused on food production. An essential feature of ornamental plant markets is that they are global. Most of consumers ornamental plants and cut flowers are located in Europe, United States of America and Japan, and the emerging producers are located in South America and Africa. Ornamental crops present a very high added value, if they are compared with vegetables and fruits, or crops like cereals. Ornamental plants and cut flowers production needs a high level of technology to control the irrigation system (soilless culture), the environment (temperature, humidity, light) and the postharvest. The aim of this study is the evaluation of the technological level used by urban farmers. More specifically, this objective can be achieved through the next questions: How to be competitive in the ornamental global market? Which are the advantages of these farmers being located in urban areas? Which channels do they use to sell their production?

In order to feed this growing population, there is a need for sustainable urban food. Producing sustainable urban food requires considering all factors of sustainability collectively including, environmental, social and economic advancement. A new method that has been proposed to address the issue of sustainability and to meet the growing food demand is, designing and implementing vertical farms. Vertical farming is a concept that involves cultivating plants with livestock on vertically inclined surfaces such as in skyscrapers in urban areas, where there is a lack of available land and space. However, there is a paucity of information and a limited number of published critical reviews on Vertical farming in urban areas. This study, in an attempt to review the major opportunities and challenges of Vertical Farming, uses the framework of sustainability to examine the role of it in prospective food provision in cities.

Treating urban wastewaters, such as greywater and hydroponic wastewater, may represent a strategic point for the implementation of urban farming, ensuring food security, reducing pressures on water resources and promoting climate change mitigation. The WETWALL design concept proposes a unique ecotechnology for secondary wastewater treatment at an urban scale, which brings the novelty of a modular living wall hybrid flow. This concept is based on the integration of two established nature-based solutions/ecomimetic designs: constructed wetlands and a modular living walls. First presented is an overview about the state of the art in the scope of living walls treating wastewater, in order to identify the main design aspects related to the performance of such systems, which mainly concerns the removal of nitrates and phosphates. Second, the WETWALL design concept is presented. A scheme regarding the selection of the main components, such as plants and substrate, is proposed, and potential structure developments and operation strategies are discussed. In addition, considering the scope of integrating the circular economy with the design process, potential interactions between this technology and the urban environment are discussed. The main goal of this article is to substantiate the potential of the WETWALL design concept as an innovative wastewater treatment at an urban scale",circular economy;constructed wetland;living wall;nature-based solutions;wastewater,,"Da Cunha, J.A.C.; Polytechnic University of Catalonia, C/Colom 1, Spain; email: joana.america.castellar@upc.edu",,Desalination Publications,19443994,,,,English,Desalin Water Treat,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85055025112,8,Denmark;Spain;Slovakia,Spain,polytechnic university of catalonia;department of biosciences;institute of architectural engineering;inspires research centre;polytechnic university of catalonia,polytechnic university of catalonia,addition;agriculture;art;article;aspects;brings;change;change mitigation;circular;circular economy;climate;climate change;components;concept;concept proposes;concerns;demand;design;design aspect;design concept;design process;designs;developments;economy;ecotechnology;environment;expansion;flow;food;food demand;food security;goal;greywater;highlight;hybrid;hybrid flow;hydroponic;hydroponic wastewater;implementation;importance;innovative wastewater;integration;interactions;land;land resource;living;main component;main design;main goal;mitigation;modular;modular living;nitrates;novelty;operation;operation strategy;order;overview;performance;phosphates;plants;point;potential interaction;potential structure;preserving water;pressures;process;proposes;removal;represent;resource highlight;resources;scale;scarcity;scheme;scope;secondary wastewater;security;selection;solutionsecomimetic design;state;strategic point;strategies;structure;structure development;substantiate;substrate;sustainable expansion;systems;technology;temperatures;treatment;unique;unique ecotechnology;urban environment;urban farming;urban scale;urban wastewater;wall;wall hybrid;wall treating;walls;wastewater;wastewater treatment;wastewaters;water;water resource;wetlands;wetwall;wetwall design,concept;design;design concept;innovative design;scale;treatment;urban scale;wastewater;—;“wetwall”;“wetwall” —,249

With this method, hydroponic systems can shift from a conventional approach using inorganic fertilisers, towards a more sustainable way of employing organic fertilisers that are recycled from organic wastes; and thus, fit better into urban agriculture in pursuit of sustainable development. However, the invented method requires at least several weeks for processing and pumping air, to build up enough of a concentration of nitrate in its nutrient solutions. Given that the method might be either more time- or energy-consuming than other urban farming practices, such as conventional hydroponics or organic field farming; this study aims to explore the effects on crop growth of an organic hydroponic system that omits the establishment process for nitrifying bacteria populations or with the removal of aeration in its cultivation period. We conducted hydroponic growing experiments with two variables, using organic fertilisers and giving aeration, to produce lettuce in a backyard of a private townhouse in Chiayi City, Taiwan, in autumn. Because the growth of the entire biomass in the treatment of organic fertilised material with aeration remained stagnant, lettuce were harvested and their weights recorded on the 25th day of the experiment. These experimental results showed that for the inorganic nutrient solution, the yields of the treatment with aeration are higher than those without aeration. On the contrary, for the organic nutrient solution, the yields from the treatment without aeration were higher than those with aeration. This confirms that nitrification is necessary for an organic hydroponic system",aeration;bioponics;hydroponics;lettuce;recycling organic waste;urban cultivation;urban households;vertical growth systems,,,,WITPress,1746448X,,,,English,WIT Trans Ecol Environ,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85062827120,3,Taiwan,Taiwan,comma company;department of horticultural science,comma company,aeration;agriculture;aims;air;approach;autumn;backyard;bacteria;biomass;build;chiayi;chiayi city;city;concentration;confirms;conventional approach;conventional hydroponics;crop;crop growth;cultivation;cultivation period;day;decade;development;effects;entire biomass;establishment;establishment process;experiment;experimental;experimental result;experiments;explore;farming practice;fertilisers;field;fit;growth;hydroponic;hydroponic system;hydroponics;inorganic;inorganic fertiliser;inorganic nutrient;lettuce;material;method;nitrate;nitrification;nutrient;nutrient solution;omits;organic fertiliser;organic field;organic hydroponic;organic hydroponics;organic nutrient;organic waste;period;populations;practices;private townhouse;process;processing;produce;produce lettuce;pursuit;removal;results;several week;shift;solution;solutions;stagnant;study;study aim;sustainable development;sustainable way;system;systems;taiwan;time;towards;townhouse;treatment;urban agriculture;urban farming;variables;wastes;way;weeks;weights;yields,agriculture;application;homegrown;hydroponics;organic hydroponics;taiwan;urban agriculture,250

The vast majority of this population surplus is expected to be absorbed by informal settlements, where the inhabitants will have to deal with inadequate or non-existent water, health or sanitation systems. At present, more than 156 million urban dwellers, live without immediate access to water. A situation that can be remedied by implementing urban proposals following the principles of Urban Acupuncture, by which small scale interventions are designed to produce large scale social change. At any given time, there are 3.1 quadrillion gallons of water in the atmosphere which if tapped could solve water scarcity. The yearly humidity average of cities like Karachi in Pakistan or Mumbai in India is around 70%. Making them the perfect sites for the use of atmospheric water generator, since these devises are designed to produce water from humidity levels as low as 35%. A single atmospheric water generator can produce up to 5000 litters of clean filtered water a day. Each of the proposed architectural interventions presented below, would house a minimum of four generators, producing 20,000 liters of a water a day. Functioning as a hive, these water towers would be placed at multiple social nodes within an informal settlement, potentially solving the water crisis by producing clean, filtered, free, accessible water and by doing so eliminating health and sanitation issues. The proposed case study presented in this paper is the result of an ongoing evolution of ideas on social design, developed to address water scarcity in informal settlements while also trying to hybridize the proposed intervention to tackle other water related issues that deal with nutrition and access to food. The idea is to create a network of interdependent facilities that directly serve a large number of people through architectural interventions that require minimal maintenance and the possibility of creating local jobs while helping solve the water and food crisis in informal settlements around the developing world",atmospheric water generator;developing world;hydroponics;sustainability;urban acupuncture;urban farming;water,,"Cerro, C.; College of Architecture, Art and Design, American University of SharjahUnited Arab Emirates",,WITPress,1746448X,,,,English,WIT Trans Ecol Environ,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85055294316,1,United Arab Emirates,United Arab Emirates,college of architecture,college of architecture,absorbed;access;accessible water;acupuncture;address;address water;architectural intervention;atmospheric water;case;case study;change;cities;clean;create;crisis;day;deal;design;developed;devises;dwellers;evolution;facilities;filtered water;food;food crisis;gallons;generator;generators;grow;health;hive;house;humidity;humidity average;humidity level;hybridize;idea;ideas;immediate;immediate access;inadequate;india;informal settlement;inhabitants;interdependent;interdependent facility;intervention;interventions;issues;jobs;karachi;large number;large scale;levels;liter;liters;litter;litters;local job;maintenance;majority;minimal;minimal maintenance;minimum;multiple;mumbai;nations;network;nodes;nonexistent;nonexistent water;number;nutrition;pakistan;paper;people;perfect;perfect site;population;population surplus;possibility;present;principles;produce;produce water;proposals;quadrillion;quadrillion gallon;related issue;require;require minimal;result;sanitation;sanitation issue;sanitation system;scale;scale intervention;scarcity;serve;settlement;settlements;single atmospheric;sites;situation;small scale;social change;social design;social node;solve;solve water;study;surplus;systems;tackle;tapped;time;towers;united nation;urban acupuncture;urban dweller;urban inhabitant;urban proposal;use;vast;vast majority;water;water crisis;water generator;water scarcity;water tower;world;world number,acupuncture;informal settlement;settlements;urban acupuncture;water,252

Instead, such high-rise urban developments present often under-utilized spaces on the vertical surfaces of buildings. A key unknown is the adequacy of light for plant growth. Many leafy vegetables that require high amounts of light form a significant proportion of the staple diet in many Asian countries. We report on the assessment of sunlight adequacy for growing leafy vegetables in a compact tropical city, based on the high-rise and high-density residential environment of Singapore. Leaf physiological traits of seven leafy vegetables were assessed and used to estimate plant light requirements. A survey of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) along exposed corridors showed that the daily light integral (DLI) value ranged from 2 to 35 mol m−2 d−1 under relatively ideal weather conditions during days with abundant solar insolation, and facades that experienced a minimum of half-day direct insolation matched the light requirements of vegetables within the moderate to very high-light categories. With regard to the building form, PAR increased gradually with height, but remains highly influenced by facade orientation and configuration. Owing to the annual north–south oscillation of the sun's path, reduced annual PAR variability and higher total annual PAR at facades, buildings with an east–west orientation will better support continuous vegetable cultivation, especially for basic building typologies without self-shading configurations. However, excessive PAR and temperatures during mid-day hours may hinder plant growth. By highlighting such patterns in levels of PAR, this study confirms the potential for high-rise and high-density conditions in the tropics to support farming using typically under-utilized vertical spaces of residential buildings",built environment;daily light integral;leafy vegetables;photosynthetically active radiation;plant physiology;urban agriculture,annual variation;leafy vegetable;light availability;photosynthetically active radiation;physiological response;residential location;tropical region;urban agriculture;urban development;singapore [southeast asia],"Song, X.P.; ETH Zurich, Future Cities Laboratory, Singapore-ETH Centre, 1 Create Way CREATE Tower, #06-01, Singapore; email: xp.song@u.nus.edu",,Elsevier GmbH,16188667,,,,English,Urban For Urban Greening,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85033364657,3,Singapore,Singapore,department of biological sciences;department of architecture,department of biological sciences,abundant;abundant solar;active radiation;adequacy;agriculture;amount;amounts;annual north–south;annual par;asian country;assessment;basic building;building;building form;building typology;buildings;categories;challenge;cities;city;city green;citys;compact;compact city;conditions;configuration;configurations;confirms;continuous vegetable;corridors;countries;cultivation;daily light;days;development present;developments;diet;direct insolation;dli;dli value;d−1;east–west;environment;estimate;estimate plant;excessive par;facade;facade orientation;facades;form;gardening;green infrastructure;growth;halfday;height;high amount;highdensity;highdensity condition;highdensity residential;highlight;highlight category;highrise;highrise urban;hinder;hinder plant;hours;ideal;ideal weather;infrastructure;insolation;integral dli;key;leaf;leafy;leafy vegetable;levels;light;light form;light requirement;limited amount;many leafy;midday;minimum;moderate;mol;mol m−2;m−2;m−2 d−1;north–south;orientation;oscillation;par;par variability;part;path;patterns;physiological trait;plant;plant growth;plant light;present;proportion;pursuit;radiation;radiation par;regard;remains;report;require;requirements;residential building;residential environment;significant proportion;singapore;solar;solar insolation;space;spaces;staple;staple diet;study;study confirms;sun path;sunlight;sunlight adequacy;suns;support;surfaces;survey;temperatures;traits;tropical city;tropics;typologies;underutilized space;underutilized vertical;urban agriculture;urban development;urban farming;value;variability;vegetable;vegetable cultivation;vegetables;vertical space;vertical surface;weather;weather condition,adequacy;assessment;city;light;light adequacy;tropical city;vertical farming,253

This article examines the motivations and practices of Bengaluru's organic terrace gardeners (""OTGians"") in order to understand the possibilities and limitations of urban gardening as a middle class intervention into unsafe food systems and decaying urban ecologies. OTGians are driven primarily by concerns about worsening food quality and safety, and secondarily by the desire to create green spaces that counteract environmental degradation in the city. Like community gardeners in the Global North, they understand urban gardening as a way to mediate problems in the contemporary food system and the urban ecology. However, like other alternative food and environmental movements, OTGians' efforts are anchored in class-specific concerns and experiences. While they have been successful in creating a vibrant community, their efforts remain limited to the middle class. This is in large part due to the site, scale, and production practices that anchor their interventions. I briefly consider a different approach to food production in Bengaluru-that of a caste-specific farming community that has been dispossessed of much of its agricultural land in the name of urban development-to illuminate divergent histories, narratives, and practices of urban agriculture. However, I also emphasize the sites of intersection between these narratives, and suggest that OTGians can find commonalities with other food producers in the city in ways that might revolutionize Bengaluru's food future. I thus look for potential sites of collaboration and intersection in understanding the uneven power relations and politics of urban socio-natures",agricultura urbana;agriculture urbaine;clase media;classe moyenne;desarrollo urbano;developpement urbain;environnement urbain;food safety;gardening;hortalizas;inde;india;india;jardinage;jardineria;middle class;seguridad alimentaria;securite alimentaire;urban agriculture;urban development;urban environment,,"Frazier, C.; Department of Humanities and Social Sciences, Clarkson UniversityUnited States; email: frazier.camille@gmail.com",,The University of Arizona Libraries,10730451,,,,English,J Polit Ecol,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85062264446,1,United States,United States,department of humanities and social sciences,department of humanities and social sciences,agricultural land;agriculture;alternative;alternative food;anchor;approach;article;article examines;bengaluru;bengalurus;bengalurus food;bengalurus organic;briefly;capital;castespecific;castespecific farming;cities;city;class;class intervention;class resident;classspecific;classspecific concern;collaboration;commonalities;community;community gardener;concerns;consumption;contemporary food;counteract;create;degradation;desire;developmentto;developmentto illuminate;different approach;divergent;divergent history;driven;ecologies;ecology;effort remain;efforts;environmental degradation;environmental movement;examines;experiences;food;food future;food producer;food production;food quality;food system;fruits;future;gardener otgians;gardeners;gardening;global north;green space;histories;home;home consumption;illuminate;illuminate divergent;indias;intersection;intervention;interventions;land;large part;limitations;look;mediate;mediate problem;middle;middle class;motivations;movements;name;narratives;north;number;order;organic terrace;otgians;part;politics;possibilities;potential site;power;power relation;practices;private space;problems;producers;production;production practice;quality;relations;remain;residents;safety;scale;site;sites;socionatures;spaces;suggest;system;systems;terrace;terrace gardener;understand;understand urban;uneven power;unsafe food;urban agriculture;urban developmentto;urban ecology;urban gardening;urban socionatures;vegetables;vibrant;vibrant community;way;ways,agriculture;class;class intervention;eat;grow;india;intervention;middle;middle class;urban agriculture,254

When studying the effect of stress factors, cadmium (60 μM), glyphosate (10 μM) or cadmium and glyphosate simultaneously (in the same concentrations) were added to the nutrient medium. Control was the standard nutrient medium. Callus cultures were analyzed at the end of the passage (day 28 of culture). Phenolic compounds extracted with 96 % ethanol from a plant material frozen with liquid nitrogen at 196 C. The content of the sum of soluble phenolic compounds was determined with a Folin-Denis reagent, flavonoids with a 1 % solution of AlCl3 at 725 and 415 nm. The concentration of phenylpropanoids was determined by direct spectrophotometric analysis of the extracts at 330 nm. To study the composition of the callus flax cultures phenolic complex compounds, the method of a thin layer chromatography on cellulose plates, solvent BUW (n-butanol + acetic acid + water in the ratio 40:12:28) were used. Callus of L. grandiflorum had a loose consistency, yellowish-green color, low growth index (by the end of the passage — 150 %) and high water content (95-97 %). As it grows, the content of soluble phenolic compounds and phenylpropanoids (biogenetically early polyphenols) increased 2.7 times by the end of the passage. The content of flavonoids, one of the most common representatives of phenolic compounds, in the first half of the cultivation cycle increased 2.25 times, and by the end of the passage slightly decreased. The application of cadmium caused the formation of dark colored necrotic cells on the surface of callus. In contrast, the application of glyphosate did not give such reaction. The application of cadmium did not affect the biosynthetic capacity of callus cultures in terms of the total accumulation of phenolic compounds, phenylpropanoids and flavonoids, the quantity of which was almost equal to that of the control. Under the application of glyphosate, however, the level of these secondary metabolites in cultures decreased, especially flavonoids. Under the simultaneous use of cadmium and glyphosate the total content of phenolic compounds in calluses increased, but we observed the decrease in the amount of phenylpropanoids and especially flavonoids. The data obtained show the differences in the response of large-flowered flax cells to the effect of stress factors on their morphology and the level of biosynthesis of phenolic compounds, the substances with high biological and antioxidant activity",cadmium;callus cultures;flavonoids;glyphosate;large-flowered flax;linum grandiflorum;phenolic compounds;phenylpropanoids;tolerance,,"Goncharuk, E.A.; Timiryazev Institute of Plant Physiology RAS, Federal Agency for Scientific Organizations, 35, ul.

A value chain mapping framework was used to describe types of inputs and outputs from chicken farms, challenges faced by producers and their disease control strategies. Commercial layer farms were defined as farms keeping exotic breeds of chicken, whereas indigenous chicken farms kept different cross breeds of indigenous chicken. Four focus group discussions were held with producers of these chickens in peri-urban area: Dagoretti, and one informal settlement: Kibera. Qualitative data were collected on interactions between farmers, sources of farm inputs and buyers of poultry products, simple ranking of production challenges, farmers' perception on diseases affecting chicken and strategies for management of sick chicken and waste products. Value chain profiles were drawn showing sources of inputs and channels for distribution of chicken products. Production challenges and chicken disease management strategies were presented as qualitative summaries. Commercial layer farms in Dagoretti kept an average of 250 chickens (range 50–500); while flock sizes in Kibera were 12 chickens (range 5–20). Farms keeping indigenous chicken had an average of 23 chickens (range 8–40) in Dagoretti, and 10 chickens (range 5–16) in Kibera. Commercial layer farms in Dagoretti obtained chicks from distributors of commercial hatcheries, but farms in Kibera obtained chicks from hawkers who in turn sourced them from distributors of commercial hatcheries. Indigenous chicken farms from Dagoretti relied on natural hatching of fertilised eggs, but indigenous chicken farms in Kibera obtained chicks from their social connection with communities living in rural areas. Outlets for eggs from commercial layer farms included local shops, brokers, restaurants and hawkers, while eggs from indigenous chicken farms were sold to neighbours and restaurants. Sieved chicken manure from Dagoretti area was fed to dairy cattle; whereas non-sieved manure was used as fertilizer on crops. Production challenges included poor feed quality, lack of space for expansion, insecurity, occurrence of diseases and lack of sources of information on chicken management. In Kibera, sick and dead chickens were slaughtered and consumed by households; this practice was not reported in Dagoretti. The chicken layer systems contribute to food security of urban households, yet they have vulnerabilities and deficiencies with regard to disease management and food safety that need to be addressed with support on research and extension",indigenous chicken;layer production;nairobi;public health risks;urban farming;value chain mapping,commercial activity;egg production;farming system;food production;food security;hatchery;health risk;identification method;livestock farming;mapping method;poultry;public health;urban area;kenya;kibera;nairobi [kenya];nairobi [nairobi (cnt)];bos;gallus gallus,"Onono, J.O.; Department of Public Health, Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of NairobiKenya; email: joshua.orungo@uonbi.ac.ke",,Elsevier Ltd,0308521X,,AGSYD,,English,Agric Syst,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85030987807,9,United Kingdom;Kenya,Kenya,department of public health;leverhulme centre for integrative research in agriculture and health;department of pathobiology and population sciences;international livestock research institute;university of liverpool,department of public health,activities;area;area dagoretti;areas;breeds;brokers;buyers;cattle;chain;chain mapping;chain profile;chains;challenges;channels;chicken;chicken disease;chicken farm;chicken farming;chicken layer;chicken management;chicken manure;chicken range;chickens;chicks;commercial hatchery;commercial layer;communities;community living;connection;contribute;control;control strategy;crops;cross;cross breed;dagoretti;dairy;dairy cattle;data;dead chicken;deficiencies;describe;describe type;different cross;discussions;disease;disease control;disease management;diseases;distribution;distributors;drawn;egg;egg value;eggs;exotic breed;expansion;extension;families;farm;farm input;farmer perception;farmers;farms;fed;feed;feed quality;fertilizer;flock;flock size;focus;focus group;food;food safety;food security;framework;group;group discussion;hatcheries;hawkers;held;households;indigenous chicken;informal settlement;information;inputs;insecurity;interactions;kept;kibera;lack;layer;layer farm;layer system;livelihood;living;local shop;management;management strategy;manure;mapping;mapping framework;nairobi;natural hatching;need;neighbours;nonsieved manure;occurrence;outlets;outputs;perception;periurban;periurban area;poor feed;poultry;poultry product;practice;producers;production;production challenge;products;profiles;qualitative;qualitative data;qualitative summary;quality;range;regard;research;restaurants;rural area;safety;security;settlement;settlement kibera;shops;sick;sick chicken;simple;simple ranking;sizes;social connection;source;sources;space;strategies;summaries;support;system contribute;systems;turn;types;urban family;urban household;value;value chain;vulnerabilities;waste;waste product;whereas,benefits;chain;chain mapping;challenges;egg;egg food;food;food system;identification;kenya;mapping;nairobi;production;production challenge;systems;value;value chain,256

The recent debate shows that the “green” variable in financial management is placed at the center of employers’ thoughts on both the discretionary dimension (culture, ethics and responsibility) and the normative-prescriptive dimension. Some positive experiences reveal the following topics: (1) the approaches of multifunctional agriculture in synergy with the themes of the European debate on Corporate Social Responsibility; (2) the definition of a new business framework; and (3) the management model oriented to stakeholders and to ethical management. The vision of the green entrepreneur in managing the company is an innovative point of view with respect to legal obligations and falls within the sphere of responsibility for environmental management. The literature, in fact, focuses on: (1) a responsible business-management model based on the “stakeholder” model, as opposed to the “shareholder model”, where the creation of value is not confined to equity holders of risk, but in which companies assume management objectives that bring mutual benefit to the community; and (2) the development of specific items in the analysis of financial statements that take into account aspects of environmental responsibility. In accord with this, the paper analyzes the application of the principles of the “responsible” management process to an Italian case study and to underline which effects they have on the scenario of enhancement of the historical farmhouse system in Volpiano (Canavese, in the metropolitan region of Turin, Italy). The coexistence of historic rural settlement patterns and new housing and industrial estates is rather common and widespread, but this case is paradigmatic, because in the territory of Volpiano the applied measures and principles followed a paradigm change in dealing with this historic farmhouse structures coexisting among new housing and industrial estates: this is an issue of great importance and not only at the local level. In fact, the final project scenario was subject to operational feasibility analysis using traditional instruments. Some specific reflections were made to estimate the financial investment for restoration and re-functioning, on the timing of site preparation and management data, and on the identification of financing channels (PSR—Programma di Sviluppo Rurale and the European CAP—Common Agricultural Policy). Lastly, feasibility is linked to the economic social responsibility, with elements of originality in the test performance and new assumptions concerning the risk/return ratio",corporate social responsibility (csr);discounted cash flow analysis;historical farmhouse system;peri-urban farming;socio-ecological accounting,,"Coscia, C.; Dipartimento di Architettura e Design, Politecnico di Torino, (DAD), C/O Castello del Valentino, Viale Mattioli, 39, Italy; email: cristina.coscia@polito.it",,Springer Verlag,18653529,,,,English,Green Energy and Technology,Book Chapter,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85045992222,2,Italy,Italy,politecnico di torino,politecnico di torino,accord;account;account aspect;action;action programme;agricultural policy;agriculture;analysis;analyzes;application;approaches;aspects;assumptions;benefit;bring;business;business framework;businessmanagement;businessmanagement model;canavese;cap—common;case;case study;center;change;channels;choice—emphasize;coexistence;community;companies;company;create;creation;culture;data;debate;debate show;definition;development;di;di sviluppo;dimension;dimension culture;discretionary dimension;effects;elements;employers’;enhancement;entrepreneur;environment;environment action;environmental management;environmental policy;environmental responsibility;equity;equity holder;estates;estimate;ethical management;ethics;european cap—common;european debate;experience reveal;experiences;fact;falls;farmhouse;farmhouse structure;farmhouse system;feasibility;feasibility analysis;final project;financial investment;financial management;financial statement;financing;financing channel;focuses;framework;future;great importance;green entrepreneur;historic;historic farmhouse;historical farmhouse;holders;housing;identification;importance;industrial estate;innovative point;instruments;investment;issue;italian case;italy;items;legal obligation;level;lisbon;lisbon strategy;literature;local level;management;management data;management model;management objective;management process;market;measures;metropolitan;metropolitan region;model;model”;multifunctional;multifunctional agriculture;mutual benefit;need;new assumption;new business;new housing;normativeprescriptive dimension;nowadays;objectives;obligations;operational feasibility;originality;paper;paper analyzes;paradigm;paradigm change;patterns;performance;point;policies;policy;positive experience;preparation;principles;process;programme;project;project scenario;psr—programma;psr—programma di;ratio;recent debate;reflections;region;respect;responsibility;responsible businessmanagement;restoration;reveal;risk;riskreturn;riskreturn ratio;rural settlement;rurale;scenario;settlement;settlement pattern;shows;site;site preparation;sixth;sixth environment;social responsibility;specific item;specific reflection;stakeholders;statements;strategies;strategy;strategy “eu;structures;study;subject;sviluppo;synergy;system;territory;test;test performance;themes;thoughts;timing;topic;topics;traditional instrument;turin;underline;value;view;vision;volpiano;volpiano canavese;“eu;“green”;“green” variable;“responsible”;“responsible” management;“shareholder;“shareholder model”;“stakeholder”;“stakeholder” model,allocation;application;approach;assets;capacities;csr;csr approach;economic asset;farmhouse;farmhouse system;historic;historic farmhouse;periurban;periurban allocation;responsible csr;sample;social capacity;system;valorization,257

Literature states how people carries out goals for sustainability in a practical approach. The eagerness to grow food is underlined by the growth of Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) from a single one in 2006 to more than 50 in 2016. Market statistics illustrates that majority of organic food in Norway is distributed in alternative channels like CSAs, Farmers market or directly from the farms. Compared to other Scandinavian countries the common market chains for organic food are less developed in Norway. Consumers motivation for participating in CSA is food security, environment and to control the food chain. CSA farmers are motivated by minimizing the economic risk and solitude.

The aim was to bring short-term activities such as mobile urban gardening to these parts of the city. These initiatives tried to improve diversity and strengthen social responsibility of communities and individuals. This paper aims to discuss the potential of using the social capital of local communities for temporary urban gardening activities, which are inherently connected to the space and its quality, to foster local sustainability. Urban gardeners are focused on local production of food, largely for local consumption.

Farms’ common city-adjustment strategies high-value production, direct marketing, participative concepts, and tourism services as well as the spatial self-assessment of the farm managers are applied to cluster and analyse them. The 180 farms are clustered via a Complete Linkage cluster analysis into five groups, whereof three are city-adjusted clusters and two are non-city-adjusted clusters. City-adjusted farms are more successful than non-city-adjusted ones. Compared to their counterpart, city-adjusted farms name better economic farm situations, predict more positive farm prospects and more assured farm successions. Additionally, they appoint more Unique Selling Propositions for their farms and make use of agricultural extension services more often. Farm business declines and farm closures are predicted very little by the city-adjusted farms, which fit to the prevalence of named urban advantages over disadvantages. These findings contribute to the lack of reliable data used to orientate policy on agriculture and food within wider metropolitan areas and urban environments",business models;city-adjustments;cluster analysis;urban agriculture;urban farming;web survey,agricultural extension;agricultural policy;agricultural production;business development;farming system;food policy;metropolitan area;self assessment;survey method;urban agriculture;urban economy;world wide web;germany;north rhine-westphalia;ruhr,"Polling, B.; South-Westphalia University of Applied Sciences, Department of Agriculture, Lubecker Ring 2, Germany; email: poelling.bernd@fh-swf.de",,Elsevier Ltd,02648377,,,,English,Land Use Policy,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85030106735,3,Poland;Germany,Germany,south-westphalia university of applied sciences;university of agriculture in krakow,south-westphalia university of applied sciences,address;advantages;agricultural extension;agriculture;analyse;analysis;appoint;areas;business;business decline;business model;cityadjustment;cityadjustment strategy;closures;cluster;cluster analysis;clusters;common cityadjustment;complete linkage;concepts;contribute;counterpart;data;declines;direct marketing;disadvantages;discourse;economic data;economic farm;environments;extension;extension service;farm;farm business;farm closure;farm manager;farm name;farm prospect;farm situation;farm succession;farming business;farmings;farms;farms’;findings;fit;food;germany;groups;highvalue;highvalue production;lack;linkage;linkage cluster;make use;managers;marketing;metropolis;metropolitan;metropolitan area;models;name;ones;orientate;orientate policy;participative;participative concepts;policy;polycentric;polycentric ruhr;positive farm;predict;prevalence;production;propositions;prospects;question;reliable data;research;research question;ruhr;ruhr metropolis;scarce;selfassessment;services;situations;spatial selfassessment;strategies;strategy highvalue;successions;survey;tourism;tourism service;unique;unique selling;urban advantage;urban environment;urban farming;use;web;web survey;whereof;wider;wider metropolitan;years,business;business models—findings;cityadjustments;farmers;farmings;germany;metropolis;models—findings;ruhr;ruhr metropolis;success;survey;urban farming,261

Concentration of elements differs regionally and is influenced by various factors. Nevertheless, some chemical elements (As, Cd, Hg, Ni, Pb, Zn, etc.) are known as environmental pollutants and may affect the quality and safety of crops and food products. The aim of the study was to determine the concentration of potentially toxic elements like Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Ni, Pb, and Zn in samples of berries grown in allotment gardens of Riga city. Dried and homogenised samples of raspberries, strawberries, red currants, black currants, gooseberries, and cherries were mineralised in a solution of concentrated HNO3/H2O2 by heating on a thermoblock. Quantitative analysis of sample solutions was performed using atomic absorption spectroscopy. Potentially toxic elements were in concentrations as follows: Fe &gt; Zn &gt; Cu &gt; Ni &gt; Pb &gt; Cr &gt; Cd.

Box 110690, Gainesville, FL  32611, United States","Raised-bed plasticulture, an intensive production system used around the world for growing high-value crops (e.g., fresh market vegetables), faces a water-food nexus that is actually a food-water-energy-land-economic nexus. Plasticulture represents a multibillion dollar facet of the United States crop production value annually and must become more efficient to be able to produce more on less land, reduce water demands, decrease impacts on surrounding environments, and be economically-competitive. Taller and narrower futuristic beds were designed with the goal of making plasticulture more sustainable by reducing input requirements and associated wastes (e.g., water, nutrients, pesticides, costs, plastics, energy), facilitating usage of modern technologies (e.g., drip-based fumigation), improving adaptability to a changing climate (e.g., flood protection), and increasing yield per unit area. Compact low-input beds were analyzed against conventional beds for the plasticulture production of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), an economically-important crop, using a systems approach involving field measurements, vadose-zone modeling (HYDRUS), and production analysis. Three compact bed geometries, 61 cm (width) × 25 cm (height), 45 cm × 30 cm, 41 cm × 30 cm, were designed and evaluated against a conventional 76 cm × 20 cm bed. A two-season field study was conducted for tomato in the ecologically-sensitive and productive Everglades region of Florida. Compact beds did not statistically impact yield and were found to reduce: 1) production costs by $150–$450/ha; 2) leaching losses by up to 5% (1 cm/ha water, 0.33 kg/ha total nitrogen, 0.05 kg/ha total phosphorus); 3) fumigant by up to 47% (48 kg/ha); 4) plasticulture's carbon footprint by up to 10% (1711 kg CO2-eq/ha) and plastic waste stream by up to 13% (27 kg/ha); 5) flood risks and disease pressure by increasing field's soil water storage capacity by up to 33% (≈1 cm); and 6) field runoff by 0.48–1.40 cm (51–76%) based on HYDRUS model simulations of 10-year, 2-h storm events in other major tomato production regions of California and Virginia. Re-designing the bed geometries in plasticulture production systems to be more compact is an example of win-win production optimization not only for traditional farms in rural areas but also for urban and peri-urban farms which are located closer to city centers. Compact beds could enable more plants per unit area, thus requiring less land area for the same production. Needing less area facilitates urban and peri-urban farming where land values can be high. Urban and peri-urban farming has several benefits, including reductions in transportation energy as production is closer to market and the ability for city wastewater to be reused for irrigation instead of freshwater withdrawals. Compact beds allow plasticulture to have smaller water, chemical, energy, carbon, waste, and economic footprints without impacting production. Improving agricultural systems in this way could enhance economic and environmental viability, which is essential for a sustainable food-water-energy-land-economic nexus",carbon;economics;plasticulture;row crops;system optimization;water,agricultural runoff;carbon;carbon dioxide;carbon footprint;commerce;cost benefit analysis;cost reduction;crops;cultivation;economics;flood control;floods;fruits;geometry;soil moisture;wastewater reclamation;water;plasticulture;production analysis;production optimization;row crop;solanum lycopersicum;surrounding environment;system optimizations;vadose zone modeling;urban transportation;agricultural economics;carbon footprint;crop production;farming system;optimization;plastic;production system;simulation;water demand;california;everglades;florida [united states];united states;virginia;lycopersicon esculentum,"Shukla, S.; Southwest Florida Research and Education Center, University of Florida, 2685 State Rd. 29 N., United States; email: sshukla@ufl.edu",,Elsevier Ltd,03091708,,AWRED,,English,Adv Water Resour,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85019150921,5,United States,United States,southwest florida research and education center;agricultural and biological engineering department;soil and water science department;horticultural sciences department,southwest florida research and education center,ability;adaptability;agricultural system;allow plasticulture;analysis;approach;area;area facilitates;areas;become;bed;bed geometry;beds;benefits;california;capacity;carbon;carbon footprint;centers;chemical;city;city center;city wastewater;climate;climate e;closer;cm;cm bed;cm height;cm width;cm ×;cmha;cmha water;co2eqha;compact;compact bed;compact lowinput;conventional bed;conventional cm;costs;crop;crop e;crop production;crops;decrease;decrease impact;demands;disease;disease pressure;dollar;dollar facet;e;economic footprint;economicallyimportant;economicallyimportant crop;efficient;energy;enhance;environmental viability;environments;events;everglades;example;facet;facilitates;facilitating usage;farms;field;field measurement;field runoff;field soil;field study;fields;flood;flood protection;flood risk;florida;foodwaterenergylandeconomic nexus;footprint;footprints;found;fresh market;freshwater;freshwater withdrawal;fumigant;fumigation;futuristic bed;g;geometries;goal;height;highvalue;highvalue crop;hydrus;hydrus model;impact;impact yield;impacts;input;input requirement;intensive production;irrigation;kg;kg co2eqha;kgha;land;land area;land value;le area;le land;leaching loss;losses;lowinput;lycopersicum;major tomato;market;market vegetable;measurements;model;model simulation;modern technology;multibillion;multibillion dollar;narrower;nexus;nitrogen;nutrients;optimization;periurban;periurban farm;periurban farming;pesticides;phosphorus;plants;plastic;plastic waste;plastics;plasticulture;plasticulture production;plasticultures;pressure;produce;production;production analysis;production cost;production optimization;production region;production system;production value;productive everglades;protection;raisedbed;raisedbed plasticulture;reductions;region;regions;requirements;risks;runoff;rural area;several benefit;simulations;soil;soil water;solanum;solanum lycopersicum;state crop;states;storage;storage capacity;storm;storm event;stream;study;sustainable foodwaterenergylandeconomic;system;system approach;systems;taller;technologies;technology e;tomato;tomato production;tomato solanum;total nitrogen;total phosphorus;traditional farm;transportation;transportation energy;twoseason;twoseason field;unit;unit area;united state;usage;vadosezone;vadosezone modeling;value;values;vegetables;viability;virginia;waste;waste e;waste stream;wastes;wastewater;water;water demand;water storage;waterfood;waterfood nexus;way;width;width ×;winwin;winwin production;withdrawals;world;yield;×;× cm;≈1;≈1 cm,bed;bed geometry;compact;compact bed;foodwaterenergylandeconomic nexus;geometries;nexus;plasticulture;plasticulture production;production,263

In her memoir Farm City: The Education of an Urban Farmer (2009), Carpenter’s story of small family farming, indeed, evokes what Eric T. Freyfogle describes as an agrarian mode of life in which humans, as members of the land community, are “just as dependent as other life on the land’s fertility and just as shaped by its mysteries and possibilities” (Freyfogle, in: Freyfogle (ed) The new agrarianism: land, culture, and the community of life, Island Press, Washington, DC, 2001, p. xiii). Carpenter’s return to the city, however, marks a critical break from traditional understandings of agrarianism, challenging the city-country binary that has long been employed in the imagining of agrarianism. Farming in the city, like traditional agrarians she is attentive to the agencies of nonhuman entities and matters; unlike them, she moves beyond their rurality to reconfigure cities as agential bodies constantly in dynamic processes of becoming. In Farm City, her return from the land shifts the emphasis from the countryside to the city, evoking a “new agrarianism” that foregrounds both environmental stewardship and community-citizenship. The urban strain of Carpenter’s farming experience, I argue, not only brings to the fore the agronomic and spiritual potentialities of inner cities but forges a new ethical relation embracing humanity and history as active agents of the agrarian community",agrarianism;back-to-the-land movement;farm city;food literature;novella carpenter;urban farming,,"Chou, S.S.; Institute of European and American Studies, Academia SinicaTaiwan; email: sschou.sinica@gmail.com",,Springer Netherlands,03244652,,,,English,Neohelicon,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85021093365,1,Taiwan,Taiwan,institute of european and american studies,institute of european and american studies,active agent;agencies;agential body;agents;agrarian community;agrarian discourse’s;agrarian ideal;agrarian mode;agrarianism;agrarianism land;agrarianism”;agrarians;american agrarian;argue;art;binary;bodies;break;brings;carpenter;carpenter’s;carpenter’s farming;carpenter’s story;cities;city;citycountry;citycountry binary;community;communitycitizenship;countryside;critical break;cultivation;culture;dc;dependent;describes;discourse’s;discourse’s ruralcentricity;diverges;dominant;dutiful;dutiful homage;dynamic process;ed;education;emphasis;entities;environmental stewardship;eric;essay;ethical relation;evokes;examine;experience;family;farm;farm city;farmer;fertility;fore;foregrounds;forges;freyfogle;freyfogle describes;freyfogle ed;history;homage;humanity;humans;ideal;inner;inner city;innercity;island;island press;land;land community;land shift;land’s;land’s fertility;life;lot;marks;matters;members;memoir;memoir farm;mode;moves;mysteries;new agrarianism;nonhuman;nonhuman entity;novella;novella carpenter;p;possibilities”;possibilities” freyfogle;potentialities;practice;press;processes;reconfigure;reconfigure city;relation;return;ruralcentricity;rurality;shifts;small family;spiritual potentiality;stewardship;story;strain;traditional agrarians;traditional understanding;transplants;understandings;urban farmer;urban strain;washington;xiii;“just;“new,agrarianism;agriculture;carpenter’s;carpenter’s farm;city;city urban;farm;farm city;novella;novella carpenter’s;urban agriculture,264

Yet, cities are exposed to (former) industrial activities and traffic, responsible for emission of contaminants. Trace elements were monitored in soils located in the urban environment of Ghent (Belgium) and 84 samples of Lactuca satica L. lettuce grown on it. The effects of cultivation in soil versus trays, neighbouring traffic and washing of the lettuce before consumption were studied. The 0–30 cm top layer of soils appeared heterogenic in composition and enriched in Co, Cd, Ni and Pb within 10 m from the nearest road. Yet, no similar elevated concentrations could be found in the crops, except for As. Besides uptake from the roots, the presence of trace elements in the plants is also caused by the atmospheric deposition of airborne particulate matter on the leaf surface. Correlation analysis and principal component analysis (PCA) revealed that this latter transport pathway might particularly be the case for Pt, Pd and Rh. Concentrations of Cd did not exceed the 0.2 mg kg−1 (fresh weight) threshold for Cd in leafy vegetables set by the European Commission. Measurements to reduce the health risks include the washing of lettuce, which effectively reduced the number of samples trespassing the maximum Pb level of 0.3 mg kg−1 (fresh weight). Also, cultivation in trays resulted in a lower As content in the plants. Taking into account a vigilance on crop selection, cultivation substrate and proper washing before consumption are considered essential steps for safe domestic horticulture in urban environments",city farming;heavy metal;platinum group metals;traffic impact;urban horticulture,agriculture;crops;food supply;health risks;heavy metals;industrial emissions;lead;meteorological problems;palladium;platinum;principal component analysis;soils;urban planning;washing;airborne particulate matters;atmospheric depositions;city farming;elevated concentrations;platinum group metals;trace element concentrations;traffic impacts;urban horticulture;trace elements;arsenic;cadmium;chromium;cobalt;copper;lead;manganese;nickel;palladium;platinum;rhodium;trace element;zinc;concentration (composition);cultivation;heavy metal;platinum group element;road traffic;trace element;urban agriculture;urban area;vegetable;article;atmospheric deposition;belgium;concentration (parameters);controlled study;horticulture;lettuce;nonhuman;particulate matter;plant root;soil pollution;traffic;urban area;belgium;east flanders;ghent;lactuca;lactuca sativa,"Folens, K.; Laboratory of Analytical Chemistry and Applied Ecochemistry, Faculty of Bioscience Engineering, Ghent University, Coupure Links 653, Belgium; email: karel.folens@gmail.com",,Springer International Publishing,00496979,,WAPLA,,English,Water Air Soil Pollut,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85035112491,3,Belgium,Belgium,ghent university;department of plant production,ghent university,account;activities;airborne particulate;analysis;analysis pca;atmospheric deposition;attention;belgium;case;cd;cities;cm;cm top;co;commission;component;component analysis;composition;concentrations;consumption;contaminants;content;context;correlation;correlation analysis;crop;crop selection;crops;cultivation;cultivation substrate;deposition;domestic horticulture;effects;elements;emission;environment;environments;essential step;european commission;exceed;food;food supply;found;fresh weight;ghent;ghent belgium;grown;health;health risk;heterogenic;horticulture;include;industrial activity;kg−1;kg−1 fresh;l;lactuca;lactuca satica;latter;latter transport;layer;leaf;leaf surface;leafy;leafy vegetable;lettuce;lettuce grown;level;matter;maximum;maximum pb;measurements;mg;mg kg−1;ni;number;particulate;particulate matter;pathway;pb;pca;pd;plants;presence;principal;principal component;proper;pt;rh;risks;road;roots;sample;samples;satica;satica l;selection;set;soil;soil versus;soils;steps;substrate;supply;surface;sustainable food;threshold;top;top layer;trace;trace element;traffic;transport;transport pathway;trays;uptake;urban environment;urban horticulture;vegetable set;vegetables;versus;versus tray;vigilance;weight;weight threshold,concentrations;element;element concentration;environment;impact;l;lactuca;lactuca sativa;lettuce;lettuce lactuca;sativa;sativa l;trace;trace element;urban environment,265

Though they make a beginning in this direction, their transformative impact on the society is still limited by unintended mechanisms of social (or racist) exclusion or by an appropriation by the municipality or the sta",care;commoning;counter power;enslavement;social inclusion / exclusion,,,,De Gruyter Oldenbourg,07235186,,,,German,Feministische Studien,Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85039038973,1,,,,,agency;agriculture;aim;alternative;alternative project;antineoliberal practice;appropriation;area;basic feminist;beings;care;caring practice;collective;collective agency;community;community agriculture;countertopography;degrowth;direction;essay;essay explores;exclusion;experiments;explores;feature;feminist;feminist feature;gardening;health;human;impact;logic;mechanisms;municipality;nature;noncapitalist;policies;practice towards;practices;projects;racist;racist exclusion;society;socioecological transformation;sta;towards;transformation;transformative;transformative impact;transformative potential;unintended mechanism;urban gardening,carelogik;gegenmacht;orte;orte uberall;potentiale;potentiale von;projekten;uberall;uberall carelogik;und;und potentiale;viele;von;von gegenmacht,267

It is an agricultural activity which employs more than 50% of the local urban population with positive and negative impacts on local and national development. Urban agriculture is an informal activity not supported by law but in practice is regulated to a certain extent by state institutions, traditional rulers, farmers and national and international non-governmental organisations. Tamale's rapid population growth, exacerbated by the unplanned development system and institutional conflicts, are factors contributing to the present bottlenecks in the urban agricultural system. In this paper, these bottlenecks are conceptualised as problems of governance. These issues will be illustrated using ethnographic data from land sales, crop-livestock competition, waste-water irrigation, and markets. I will explain how conflicts which arise from these different situations are resolved through the interactions of various governance systems. Informal governance arrangements are widespread, but neither they nor formal systems are always successful in resolving governance issues. A participatory governance does not seem possible due to actors' divergent interests. A governance solution for this sector is not yet apparent, contributing to food and nutritional insecurity",governance;informal;legitimacy;northern ghana;participatory;power;sustainability;urban agriculture,alternative agriculture;food security;governance approach;informal sector;livelihood;nongovernmental organization;participatory approach;urban agriculture;urban population;ghana,"Nchanji, E.B.; Institute of Social and Cultural Anthropology, Georg-August UniversitatGermany; email: eileen-bogweh.nchanji@sowi.uni-goettingen.de",,MDPI AG,20711050,,,,English,Sustainability,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85034261157,1,Germany,Germany,institute of social and cultural anthropology,institute of social and cultural anthropology,activity;actor divergent;actors;advantage;agricultural activity;agricultural system;agriculture;apparent;arise;arrangements;bottlenecks;certain extent;city;competition;conflicts;croplivestock;croplivestock competition;data;development;development system;different situation;divergent;divergent interest;dwellers;employs;ethnographic data;explain;extent;factors;farmers;food;formal system;governance;governance arrangement;governance issue;governance solution;governance system;growth;impacts;informal activity;informal governance;infrastructure;insecurity;institutional conflict;institutions;interactions;interests;international nongovernmental;irrigation;issues;land;land sale;law;livelihoods;local urban;market;markets;national development;negative impact;nongovernmental organisation;nutritional insecurity;organisations;paper;participatory;participatory governance;periurban;periurban dweller;population;population growth;practice;present;present bottleneck;problems;provide;proximity;rapid population;rulers;sales;sector;seem;situations;solution;state;state institution;sustain;system;systems;tamale rapid;tamales;traditional rulers;transport;unplanned development;urban agriculture;urban farming;urban infrastructure;urban population;various governance;wastewater;wastewater irrigation,agriculture;ghana;governance;governance systemworks;systemworks;urban agriculture,268

Generally, this area is utilized for urban infrastructures and residences. Furthermore, urban area has grown uncontrollably that could enhance the phenomenon of urban sprawl. The conversion of green urban area and agricultural area will significantly decrease urban food security and quality of urban environment. This problem becomes a serious issue for urban sustainability. Bandung is a city with dense population where there are many poor inhabitants. Families living in poverty are subjected to food insecurity caused by the rise of food prices. Based on the urgency of urban food security and urban environment quality the local government has to achieve comprehensive solutions. This research aims to formulate the policy of productive green open space towards food security for poor people in Bandung. This research not only examines the role played by productive green open space to supply food for the urban poor but also how to govern urban areas sustainably and ensure food security. This research uses descriptive explanatory methodology that describes and explains how to generate policy and strategic planning for edible landscape to promote urban food security. Taman Sari is the location of this research, this area is a populous area that has amount of poor people and has a quite worse quality of urban environment.

Expectations for urban farming often centre on traditional measures of economic development, potentially overlooking other benefits. Through a qualitative case study conducted in Baltimore, Maryland, we sought to understand community perceptions regarding the ways in which urban farms can benefit cities. Interviews with residents, neighbourhood leaders, and urban farmers in three residential neighbourhoods with urban farms revealed the pathways by which community members view farms as improving neighbourhoods. Benefits stemmed from four primary changes urban farms made to study neighbourhoods: creation of public projects welcoming involvement, physical improvement of degraded space, production of local food, and creation of new businesses. These changes led to multiple perceived benefits including increased social connectedness, a transformed physical landscape, improved neighbourhood reputation, increased access to fresh produce, and educational, youth development, and employment opportunities. Our findings demonstrate the importance of a multifunctional paradigm that accounts for social and educational functions in assessing the value of urban farming and bring empirical evidence to the concept of multifunctional agriculture. Urban farms with strong social aims may appear to contribute little to economic development if measured using traditional indicators of success such as job creation or fiscal impacts, but provide numerous other benefits for community development",multifunctional agriculture;qualitative methods;urban agriculture,community development;economic development;farming system;neighborhood;perception;qualitative analysis;urban agriculture;baltimore;maryland;united states,"Poulsen, M.N.; Department of International Health, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, 615 N.

The space of the gardens is multilayered. Firstly, it operates as an integration grid–a homogenizing-organized cultural encounter evolving around a foreigner–Dane binary. However, the gardens also emerge as a web of gardening, centered around plants and gardening practices, breaching multiple (hi)stories, locations, relationships, and materialities. The article juxtaposes the spatiotemporal logics of the integration grid and the web of gardening, analyzing the possibilities for action and relating they afford. The analysis contributes to theorizations of organized cultural encounters by highlighting the embodied, affective human and non-human agencies in divergent space-making practices.

Given the role of this practice in increasing urban resilience, most notably social resilience, municipalities in the Global North are promoting CUG as a nature-based solution (NbS). However, the mechanisms by which institutional actors can best support and facilitate CUG are understudied, which could create a gap between aspiration and reality. The aim of this study is therefore to identify what governance arrangements contribute to CUG delivering social resilience. Through the EU GREEN SURGE project, we studied six CUG initiatives from five EU-countries, representing different planning regimes and traditions. We selected cases taking a locally unique or innovative approach to dealing with urban challenges. A variety of actors associated with each of the cases were interviewed to achieve as complete a picture as possible regarding important governance arrangements. A cross-case comparison revealed a range of success factors, varying from clearly formulated objectives and regulations, municipal support, financial resources and social capital through to the availability of local food champions and facilitators engaging in community building. Municipalities can support CUG initiatives by moving beyond a rigid focus on top-down control, while involved citizens can increase the impact of CUG by pursuing political, in addition to hands-on, activities. We conclude that CUG has clear potential to act as a nature-based solution if managed with sensitivity to local dynamics and context",governance;nature-based solutions;participation;social resilience;urban agriculture,city;environmental protection;european union;human;land use;legislation and jurisprudence;cities;conservation of natural resources;european union;gardens;humans,"van der Jagt, A.P.N.; Centre for Ecosystems, Society and Biosecurity, Forest Research, Northern Research StationUnited Kingdom; email: a.p.n.vanderjagt@uu.nl",,Academic Press Inc.,00139351,,ENVRA,28823804.0,English,Environ Res,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85027588964,7,Sweden;Slovenia;Netherlands;United Kingdom;Portugal,United Kingdom,centre for ecosystems;copernicus institute of sustainable development;department of landscape architecture;department of streets and parks;department of agronomy;university of lisbon;stockholm resilience centre;wageningen university,centre for ecosystems,achieve;act;activities;actors;addition;aim;allotments;approach;arrangement contribute;arrangements;aspiration;availability;building;capital;cases;challenges;champions;citizens;clear potential;communal;communal urban;community;community building;community garden;comparison;conclude;context;contribute;control;countries;create;crosscase;crosscase comparison;cug;cug initiative;different planning;dynamics;eu;eu green;eucountries;european union;facilitate;facilitate cug;facilitators;factors;financial resource;focus;food;food champion;gap;gardening;gardening cug;gardens;global north;governance;governance arrangement;green surge;handson;impact;important governance;increase;initiatives;innovative approach;institutional actor;interviewed;local dynamic;local food;many country;mechanisms;municipal support;municipalities;naturebased solution;nbs;north;objectives;picture;planning;planning regime;popularity;practice;project;range;reality;regimes;regulations;resilience;resources;rigid focus;rise;role;sensitivity;social capital;social resilience;solution;solution nb;study;success;success factor;support;support cug;surge;surge project;topdown;traditions;union;union eu;unique;urban challenge;urban gardening;urban resilience;variety,communal;communal urban;european union;gardens;governance;naturebased solution;solutions;union;urban garden,273

This has implications for how projects navigate complexity to achieve impact. However, few studies have systematically evaluated how project actors engage with other actors to configure capabilities and resources across multiple levels in agricultural innovation systems (AIS), from the individual to the network, to mobilise and build systemic innovation capacity. An analytical framework conceptualising the nested configuration of capabilities at multiple levels in the AIS is applied to two projects that successfully tackled agricultural and land management problems of differing complexity: (i) improving lamb survival; and (ii) sustainable land management in New Zealand. Findings indicate that innovation capacity constitutes project actors interacting with other AIS actors to configure capabilities and resources at different levels of the AIS in order to leverage positive project path dependencies and break path dependencies that are created by existing and historical capability configurations. Project actors also balance exploiting existing innovation capabilities, as well as using adaptive capability for exploring and creating new capability configurations to respond to emerging circumstances.

Rooftop and vertical farms integrated with various technologies, such as hydroponics and aquaponics, have been commercialized over the past few years in Singapore. However, to compensate for the lack of land space and an increasing population Singapore needs to develop its own unique effective farming system that will be independent of eventual climate changes. Using aeroponic systems, our previous studies showed that cooling the root-zone (RZ) could produce all types of vegetables throughout the year. Currently, we have expanded Singapore's urban farming technology by successfully developing an LED-integrated vertical aeroponic farming (VAF) system that can be used both indoors and in greenhouses, for vegetable production. Other than providing sufficient and uniform light intensity to the plants, the factor key to the success of this VAF system is the provision of a low energy input engineering solution - the use of light emitting diodes (LEDs) - to enhance photosynthesis and maximise crop productivity. Our self-designed LED integrated VAF systems have been used to successfully grow lettuce (Lactuca sativa), Chinese broccoli (Brassica alboglabra), Nai Bai (Brassica chinensis), mizuna (Brassica juncea var. japonica) and culinary herbs, such as red and green Chinese basil (Perilla frutescens), and sweet basil (Ocimum basilicum). Experiments have also been carried out to identify optimal combinations, durations, and intensities of LED lighting for maximal vegetable production. Our results showed that all vegetables grown under LED lighting exhibited higher photosynthetic capacities, enhanced productivity, and higher crop rotation. Howeverwe have also found that optimal growth conditions are species-dependent. In conclusion, although there are various vegetable farming strategies for space limited environments, extensive use of our LED integrated VAF systems would diminish our reliance on vegetable imports and enhance foo security in Sipore. greenhou",,,"He, J.; National Institute of Education, Nanyang Technological University, Nanyang Walk, Singapore",Duggan-Jones D.Nichols M.A.,International Society for Horticultural Science,05677572,9789462611726,,,English,Acta Hortic,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85036671316,1,Singapore,Singapore,national institute of education,national institute of education,aeroponic;aeroponic farming;aeroponic system;alboglabra;aquaponics;bai;bai brassica;basil;basil ocimum;basil perilla;basilicum;brassica;brassica alboglabra;brassica chinensis;brassica juncea;broccoli;broccoli brassica;capacities;changes;chinensis;chinese basil;chinese broccoli;cities;climate;climate change;combinations;compensate;conclusion;conditions;crop;crop productivity;crop rotation;culinary;culinary herb;demand;diminish;diodes;durations;effective farming;energy;energy input;engineering;engineering solution;enhance;enhance foo;enhance photosynthesis;environments;eventual climate;experiments;extensive use;factor;factor key;farms;foo;foo security;food;found;frutescens;generates;green chinese;greenhou;greenhouses;grow;grow lettuce;grown;growth;growth condition;herbs;howeverwe;hydroponics;imports;indoors;input;input engineering;intensities;intensity;japonica;juncea;juncea var;key;lack;lactuca;lactuca sativa;land;land space;leds;lettuce;lettuce lactuca;light;light intensity;limited city;limited environment;low energy;maximal;maximal vegetable;maximise;maximise crop;mizuna;mizuna brassica;nai;needs;ocimum;ocimum basilicum;optimal combination;optimal growth;past;perilla;perilla frutescens;photosynthesis;photosynthetic capacity;plants;population;population generates;population singapore;previous study;produce;production;productivity;provision;reliance;results;rooftop;rootzone;rootzone rz;rotation;rz;sativa;security;singapore;singapores;sipore;solution;space;speciesdependent;strategies;studies;success;sufficient;sweet;sweet basil;system;systems;technologies;technology;tremendous demand;types;uniform;uniform light;unique;urban farming;use;vaf;vaf system;var;various technology;vegetable;vegetable farming;vegetable grown;vegetable import;vegetable production;vegetables;vertical aeroponic;vertical farm;year;years,aeroponic;aeroponic farming;environments;limited environment;production;space;systems;vegetable;vegetable production;vertical aeroponic,275

Southern countries with a warmer and drier climate are especially looking to enough quantity to increase production while north western European countries have to face the quality aspects of discharge water emitting to the environment. As a consequence both want to recirculate the nutrient solution in soilless cultivation, but facing different problems. For incoming water the sodium concentration should be as low as possible to avoid accumulation and, consequently, discharge. Discharge water contains nutrients (nitrates, phosphates) and plant protection products (PPPs) which pollute surface water realizing non-natural ecosystems in ditches and canals. The concentration of PPPs often appeared to be too high for quality surface water standards, it led to legislation to purify the discharge water by 95%in 2018. On the other hand it was already said that, as a consequence of European legislation, discharge of nitrogen should go down to almost zero in 2027. Preliminary results of emission free cultivation will be shown. System development took mainly place in crops as leafy vegetables, strawberries and chrysanthemums with roughly more than 10-15 plants m-2. Nutrient film technique (NFT) in various trough shapes, deep flow technique (DFT) with floating panels for lettuce and herbs often in combination with mechanisation and automation make a revival. Research emphasises on knowledge of the microbial flora in the recirculating water and resilience against pathogens.

However, few studies have linked these two strands of research together to analyze whether urban gardening activity may be a step forward in addressing issues of access for food desert residents. Methods: The Phoenix, Arizona metropolitan area is used as a case to demonstrate the utility of spatial optimization models for siting urban gardens near food deserts and on vacant land. The locations of urban gardens are derived from a list obtained from the Maricopa County Cooperative Extension office at the University of Arizona which were geo located and aggregated to Census tracts. Census tracts were then assigned to one of three categories: tracts that contain a garden, tracts that are immediately adjacent to a tract with a garden, and all other non-garden/non-adjacent census tracts. Analysis of variance is first used to ascertain whether there are statistical differences in the demographic, socio-economic, and land use profiles of these three categories of tracts. A maximal covering spatial optimization model is then used to identify potential locations for future gardening activities. A constraint of these models is that gardens be located on vacant land, which is a growing problem in rapidly urbanizing environments worldwide. Results: The spatial analysis of garden locations reveals that they are centrally located in tracts with good food access. Thus, the current distribution of gardens does not provide an alternative food source to occupants of food deserts. The maximal covering spatial optimization model reveals that gardens could be sited in alternative locations to better serve food desert residents. In fact, 53 gardens may be located to cover 96.4% of all food deserts. This is an improvement over the current distribution of gardens where 68 active garden sites provide coverage to a scant 8.4% of food desert residents. Conclusion: People in rapidly urbanizing environments around the globe suffer from poor food access. Rapid rates of urbanization also present an unused vacant land problem in cities around the globe. This paper highlights how spatial optimization models can be used to improve healthy food access for food desert residents, which is a critical first step in ameliorating the health problems associated with lack of healthy food access including heart disease and obesity",community gardens;food access;food deserts;spatial optimization;urban agriculture;urbanization;vacant land,accessibility;fruit;garden;metropolitan area;optimization;spatial analysis;urban agriculture;urbanization;vegetable;arizona;phoenix;united states;arizona;catering service;city;environment;epidemiology;gardening;human;land use;procedures;spatial analysis;standards;arizona;cities;environment;food supply;gardening;gardens;humans;spatial analysis,"Mack, E.A.; Michigan State University, Department of Geography, Environment and Spatial Sciences, Geography Building, 673 Auditorium Rd, United States; email: emack@msu.edu",,BioMed Central Ltd.,1476072X,,,29037243.0,English,Int J Health Geogr,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85031504972,3,United States,United States,michigan state university;arizona state university,michigan state university,access;active garden;activities;activity;adjacent;alternative;alternative food;alternative location;analysis;analyze;area;arizona;arizona metropolitan;ascertain;background;background food;benefits;case;categories;category tract;census;census tract;cities;conclusion;conclusion people;constraint;contain;cooperative;cooperative extension;county;county cooperative;cover;coverage;current distribution;demonstrate;desert;desert resident;deserts;differences;disease;distribution;environment worldwide;environments;extension;extension office;fact;first step;food;food access;food desert;food source;future;future gardening;garden;garden location;garden site;gardening;gardening activity;gardens;geo;global issue;globe;globe suffer;good food;health;health problem;healthy food;heart;heart disease;highlights;improvement;issue;issues;lack;land;land problem;land use;list;location;location reveals;locations;maricopa;maximal;methods;metropolitan;metropolitan area;model;model reveals;models;nongardennonadjacent;nongardennonadjacent census;obesity;occupants;office;optimization;optimization model;paper;paper highlight;people;phoenix;poor food;potential location;present;problem;problems;profiles;provide;provide coverage;rapid rate;rates;reason;research;residents;results;reveals;scant;serve;serve food;site provide;sites;source;spatial analysis;spatial optimization;statistical difference;step;strands;studies;suffer;tract;tracts;university;unused vacant;urban garden;urban gardening;urbanization;urbanizing environment;use;use profile;utility;vacant;vacant land;variance;wealth;worldwide,approach;desert;environments;gardening;gardens;optimization;optimization approach;spatial optimization;urban environment,278

The first trend is characterised by official urban policies that introduce the private and voluntary sector into the management and maintenance of public space. While forming part of the dominant neoliberal paradigm, privatisation processes materialise through a local mix of mechanisms in crisis-stricken Thessaloniki. The second trend originates from citizen-led initiatives and seeks to reassert ‘publicness’, foregrounding collective activity and participation. A case of urban farming of an abandoned military camp is reviewed as an example of this trend. The article argues that the two trends contribute to the creation of a hybrid landscape of public space in which the commonly perceived binary of private and public is redefined towards two divergent directions, representing different imaginaries of ‘publicness’",disused military camps;economic crisis;public space;thessaloniki;urban agriculture,,"Athanassiou, E.; Faculty of Engineering, Department of Architecture, Aristotle University of ThessalonikiGreece; email: evieath@arch.auth.gr",,Routledge,01426397,,,,English,Landsc Res,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85029407581,1,Greece,Greece,department of architecture,department of architecture,activity;agents;argues;article;article argues;article focus;binary;camp;case;collective;collective activity;contribute;creation;crisisstricken;different imaginary;directions;divergent;divergent direction;dominant;example;focuses;hybrid;hybrid landscape;imaginaries;initiatives;introduce;landscape;local mix;maintenance;management;materialise;mechanisms;military camp;mix;nature;neoliberal paradigm;new agent;official;originates;paradigm;part;participation;policies;privatisation;privatisation process;process materialise;processes;public;public nature;public space;reassert;reassert ‘publicness’;redefine;second trend;sector;seeks;space;spaces;thessaloniki;towards;trend;trend contribute;trend originates;trends;urban farming;urban policy;voluntary sector;‘publicness’,context;crisis;hybrid;hybrid landscape;landscape;public;public space;space;thessaloniki,279

The added pleasure that comes with handling extremely fresh vegetables can enhance their cooking technique, point up the environmental advantages of local produce, and inform their menu development. Garden experience can also give entry-level culinary graduates a leg up in the farm-to-table restaurant market. This case study describes how a garden initiative developed to enhance culinary education became embedded within the subculture of college clubs and social activism. It builds on the large body of scholarship which has demonstrated the personal, educational, and social benefits that come with student gardening and nature connections in an urban setting.

There is a paucity of burden estimates due to gastrointestinal infection in people living along the wastewater system, and among people who are in direct contact with the wastewater, such as farmers using wastewater in agriculture and aquaculture. Methods A quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) was pursued focussing on four population groups characterised by different levels of exposure to wastewater: (i) workers maintaining the wastewater conveyance and treatment systems; (ii) urban farmers using wastewater from To Lich River; (iii) community members in urban areas exposed to flooding events in the districts of Hoang Mai and Thanh Tri; and (iv) peri-urban farmers in Thanh Tri district, where Red River water is used for agriculture and aquaculture. The QMRA was developed on the basis of measured concentration of Escherichia coli and Salmonella spp. and Ascaris spp. eggs in water samples. Published ratios between measured organisms and pathogenic strains of norovirus, rotavirus, Campylobacter spp., pathogenic E. coli, pathogenic Salmonella spp., Cryptosporidium spp. and Ascaris lumbricoides were employed to estimate annual risk of gastrointestinal infection and disease burden. Results The QMRA estimated a disease burden of 0.011 disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) per person per year in urban farmers, 0.006 DALYs for sanitation workers, 0.0005 DALYs for urban communities at risk of flooding events and 0.0004 DALYs for peri-urban farmers. Urban farmers had considerably higher incidence estimates for gastrointestinal disease episodes per year (2.0) compared to the other exposure groups (≤ 1.0). Conclusions Urban farmers using wastewater from To Lich River have a high gastrointestinal disease burden, which is about 100 times larger than the health-based targets for wastewater use set by the World Health Organization. These findings are of direct public health relevance and call for upgrading Hanoi's wastewater system to reduce microbial contamination. Finally, this study presents a first example on how to link QMRA to a sanitation safety planning (SSP) approach in an Asian context and its findings are interesting in the frame of Sustainable Development Goal (SDGs) #6",bacteria;helminths;quantitative microbial risk assessment;sanitation safety planning;sustainable development goals;urban farming;vietnam;wastewater,agriculture;aquaculture;bacteria;escherichia coli;floods;health;health risks;occupational risks;planning;risk assessment;risk perception;river pollution;rivers;safety engineering;salmonella;sanitation;sustainable development;urban planning;wastewater;helminths;quantitative microbial risk assessment;safety planning;urban farmings;viet nam;wastewater treatment;coliform bacterium;health risk;infectious disease;microbiology;public health;quantitative analysis;risk assessment;sanitation;sustainable development;urban planning;urban pollution;wastewater treatment;hanoi;lich river;red river [asia];viet nam;ascaris;ascaris lumbricoides;campylobacter;cryptosporidium;escherichia coli;norovirus;rotavirus;salmonella;vermes,"Fuhrimann, S.; University of BaselSwitzerland; email: samuel.fuhrimann@unibas.ch",,Elsevier Ltd,03091708,,AWRED,,English,Adv Water Resour,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85009211828,8,Switzerland;Denmark,Switzerland,swiss tropical and public health institute;university of basel;national food institute;center for public health and ecosystem research;department of microbiology;international livestock research institutehanoi,swiss tropical and public health institute,agriculture;annual risk;approach;aquaculture;areas;ascaris;ascaris lumbricoides;ascaris spp;asian context;assessment;assessment qmra;background;basis;burden;burden estimate;call;campylobacter;campylobacter spp;capacities;coli;communities;community;community member;concentration;conclusion urban;conclusions;contact;contamination;context;conveyance;cryptosporidium;cryptosporidium spp;dalys;developed;development;development goal;different level;direct contact;direct public;disease;disease burden;disease episode;district;districts;e;eggs;episodes;escherichia;escherichia coli;estimate;estimates;events;example;exposure;exposure group;farmers;findings;frame;gastrointestinal;gastrointestinal disease;gastrointestinal infection;goal;goal sdgs;groups;hanoi;hanoi wastewater;hanois;health;health organization;health relevance;high gastrointestinal;hoang;hoang mai;ii;ii urban;iii;iii community;improvements;incidence;incidence estimate;infection;iv;iv periurban;levels;lich;lich river;life;life year;link;link qmra;living;lumbricoides;mai;members;methods;microbial;microbial contamination;microbial pollution;microbial risk;norovirus;organisms;organization;pathogenic;pathogenic e;pathogenic salmonella;pathogenic strain;paucity;people;periurban;periurban farmer;person;planning;planning ssp;pollution;population;population group;presents;public;public health;qmra;quantitative;quantitative microbial;ratios;recent improvement;red river;relevance;results;risk;risk assessment;river;river water;rotavirus;safety;safety planning;salmonella;salmonella spp;samples;sanitation;sanitation safety;sanitation worker;sdgs;set;spp;ssp;ssp approach;strains;study;study present;sustainable development;system;systems;targets;thanh;thanh tri;time;times;treatment;treatment capacity;treatment system;tri;tri district;urban area;urban community;urban farmer;use;use set;vietnam;wastewater;wastewater conveyance;wastewater system;wastewater treatment;wastewater use;water;water sample;workers;world;world health;year;year dalys;years;≤,burden;disease;disease burden;gastrointestinal;gastrointestinal infection;hanoi;infections;living;major wastewater;people;system;vietnam;wastewater;wastewater system,282

Understanding the biology of Brucella infections and the transmission patterns at the wildlife/livestock/human interface is of paramount importance before implementing any brucellosis control or eradication program in animals, even more so should interventions be justified within One Health. In addition to calling for transdisciplinary collaboration, One Health formally aims to conserve the environment and to promote the well-being of animals. In this opinion paper, the One Health approach of brucellosis is reviewed in the industrialized and the low and middle income countries, highlighting pitfalls and shortcomings of serological studies and discussing the role of urban and peri-urban farming for the re-emergence of brucellosis in the developing world. The role of wildlife as a potential reservoir is highlighted and different management strategies are discussed. Lastly, beyond its role in the control of brucellosis, the ethical dimension of culling wildlife to control disease emergence or spill-back of infections in livestock is discussed. Core transdisciplinary competencies such as values and ethics are critically important in guiding the development of One Health curricula and in continuing professional education, as they describe the knowledge, skills, and attitudes required to be effective. A conceptual framework needs to be developed from inception to knowledge translation. Importantly, transdisciplinary competencies should be developed as an adjunct to discipline-specific areas of expertise, not as a replacement. A profound understanding of the biology of infectious agents is and will always remain a pre-requisite for any sound One Health approach",,,"Godfroid, J.; University of Tromso - the Arctic University of Norway, Faculty of Biosciences, Fisheries and Economics, Department of Arctic and Marine Biology, Research Group of Arctic Infection Biology, Langnes, Postbox 6050, Norway; email: Jacques.godfroid@uit.no",,BioMed Central Ltd.,07787367,,APHEE,,English,Arch Public Health,Note,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85029153690,1,Norway,Norway,university of tromso - the arctic university of norway,university of tromso - the arctic university of norway,addition;adjunct;agents;aims;animals;approach;areas;attitudes;biology;brucella;brucella infection;brucellosis;brucellosis control;brucellosis remains;cases;collaboration;commonest;competencies;conceptual framework;conserve;control;control disease;core;core transdisciplinary;countries;curricula;describe;developed;development;different management;dimension;disciplinespecific;disciplinespecific area;disease;disease emergence;disease worldwide;education;emergence;environment;eradication;eradication program;ethical dimension;ethics;expertise;framework;framework need;health;health approach;health curriculum;human;human brucellosis;importance;inception;income;income country;infections;infectious agent;interface;interventions;knowledge;knowledge translation;livestock;management;management strategy;middle;middle income;needs;new case;opinion;opinion paper;paper;paramount;paramount importance;patterns;periurban;periurban farming;pitfalls;potential reservoir;prerequisite;professional education;profound;profound understanding;program;promote;reemergence;remain;remains;replacement;reservoir;role;serological study;shortcomings;skills;sound;spillback;strategies;studies;transdisciplinary collaboration;transdisciplinary competency;translation;transmission;transmission pattern;values;wildlife;wildlifelivestockhuman;wildlifelivestockhuman interface;world;worldwide;zoonotic disease,approaches;brucellosis;diseases;health;health approach;livestock;need;pandemic;pandemic potential;wildlife;wildlife zoonotic;zoonotic disease,284

Here, a remote sensing and GIS-based modeling framework was developed to locate and quantify available area for urban farming, including both rooftop and ground level areas in the city of Boston, MA, USA. Geoprocessing and spatial analysis tools were used to process geographic data layers for zoning, ownership, slope, soil quality, and adequate light availability. Surface slope (roof pitch) was determined for all buildings in the city through the creation of a digital surface map from remotely sensed LiDAR data. Potential parcels from ground level public and private vacant lots and underutilized residential and commercial areas were mapped using publicly available datasets. Approximately 922 ha of rooftop and 1,250 ha of ground level parcels have been identified, representing 7.4% and 10% of the total land area in Boston, respectively. Finally, food yield values for common urban agricultural crops were used to estimate the city's food production potential from the identified parcels. Despite Boston's density, the mapped areas have potential to produce enough fresh fruits and vegetables for Boston's population, while providing both environmental and economic co-benefits.

Yet they are also sites of significant conflict based on competing political, economic, and ecological projects. These projects range from radical re-envisionings of liberatory urban spaces, reformist aesthetic and sanitary improvement programmes, to underwriting the production of the neo-liberal city. These projects are based on divergent visions of the garden ground itself, in particular, whether this is soil (the fertile and living source for growing food and social values) or dirt (an inert and even problematic substrate to be removed or built upon for development purposes). These are not fixed or mutually exclusive categories, but are unstable as soil/dirt moves in discursive and material ways over time and space. Contaminants such as lead in the soil contribute to this instability, reframing fertile soil as dangerous dirt. To understand this discursive and material movement of soil/dirt over time and space, a dynamic spatial politics framework is needed that encompasses three scalar concepts: location, duration, and interconnection. This paper applies this dynamic spatial politics framework to interpret the 30-year conflict over the fate of an urban garden in Sacramento, California, that began as a countercultural space and was eventually transformed into a manicured amenity for a gentrifying neighbourhood, and the role of soil lead contamination in this narrative",archival research;community gardens;neighbourhood activism;soil lead;urban development,garden;lead;neighborhood;public space;research;soil pollution;urban area;urban development;california;sacramento;united states,"Cutts, B.B.; Department of Parks, Recreation, and Tourism, North Carolina State University, 2800 Faucette Drive, United States; email: bcutts@illinois.edu",,Routledge,13549839,,,,English,Local Environ,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85018673992,5,United States,United States,department of natural resources and environmental sciences;department of human ecology;center for regional change;university of california;department of biological sciences;department of plant sciences;department of parks;center for geospatial analytics,department of natural resources and environmental sciences,amenity;applies;building;built;california;categories;city;concept location;concepts;conflict;contaminants;contamination;contribute;countercultural space;dangerous dirt;development;development purpose;dirt;discursive;divergent;divergent vision;duration;ecological project;encompasses;environmental health;exclusive category;fate;fertile;fertile soil;food;framework;garden;garden ground;gardens;ground;health;improvement;improvement programme;inert;instability;interconnection;interpret;lead;lead contamination;liberatory;living;location;material;material movement;material way;movement;moves;neighbourhood;neoliberal city;paper;paper applies;places;politics;problematic substrate;production;programmes;project range;projects;purposes;radical reenvisionings;range;reenvisionings;reformist;role;sacramento;sanitary improvement;scalar;scalar concept;significant conflict;sites;social value;soil;soil contribute;soil lead;soildirt;soildirt move;source;space;spaces;spatial politics;substrate;time;understand;underwriting;urban garden;urban space;values;visions;ways,dirt;dirt soil;gardening;lead;politics;soil;spatial politics;urban gardening,287

Computer simulations utilizing primary data explored UF's ability to reduce these footprints using select farming technologies, building on previous city-scale UF assessments which have hitherto been dependent on proxy data for UF. We found that UF generated meagre food-related carbon footprint reductions (1.1-2.9% of baseline 2211 kg CO2 equivalents/capita/annum) and land occupation increases (&lt;1% of baseline 9000 m2 land occupation/capita/annum) under optimal production scenarios, informing future evidence-based urban design and policy crafting in the region. Notwithstanding UF's marginal environmental gains, UF could help Boston meet national nutritional guidelines for vegetable intake, generate an estimated $160 million U.S. in revenue to growers and act as a pedagogical and community building tool, though these benefits would hinge on large-scale UF proliferation, likely undergirded by environmental remediation of marginal lands in the city",,carbon footprint;environmental impact;food supply;sustainable development;water conservation;carbon emissions;carbon footprint reductions;community buildings;environmental remediation;food consumption;multi-region input-output models;optimal production;urban sustainability;urban transportation;agricultural technology;carbon footprint;emission control;environmental economics;environmental impact assessment;environmental policy;farming system;input-output analysis;sustainability;urban area;urban design;agricultural worker;article;carbon footprint;computer simulation;economic aspect;ecosystem restoration;environmental impact;environmental policy;environmental sustainability;food contamination;food industry;food intake;geographic distribution;human;land use;massachusetts;nutritional requirement;nutritional value;occupation;united states;urban area;vegetable;agriculture;city;united states;boston;massachusetts;united states;agriculture;boston;carbon footprint;cities;new england,"Goldstein, B.P.; Technical University of Denmark, Quantitative Sustainability Assessment Division, Produktionstorvet, Building 424Denmark; email: bgol@dtu.dk",,American Chemical Society,0013936X,,ESTHA,28636338.0,English,Environ Sci Technol,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85024402101,4,Denmark;United States,Denmark,technical university of denmark;massachusetts institute of technology,technical university of denmark,ability;act;assessments;baseline;baseline kg;baseline m2;benefits;boston;boston meet;building;building tool;carbon;carbon emission;carbon footprint;city;citys;cityscale;cityscale uf;co2;co2 equivalentscapitaannum;community;community building;computer;computer simulation;consumption;contributor;data;dependent;design;developed;emissions;environmental gain;environmental impact;environmental remediation;equivalentscapitaannum;estimate;estimate suburban;etc;evidencebased urban;food;food consumption;foodborne;foodborne carbon;footprint;footprint reduction;footprints;found;future;gains;generate;growers;guidelines;help;help boston;hinge;hitherto;illustrative northeast;impact carbon;impacts;important contributor;increase;increase lt;increase urban;increases;intake;kg;kg co2;land;land footprint;land occupation;land occupationcapitaannum;lands;largescale;largescale uf;local resource;lt;m2;m2 land;marginal land;meagre;means;meet;method;multiregioninputoutput;national nutritional;northeast;northeast u;novel;novel method;nutritional guideline;nutritional survey;occupation;occupation increase;occupationcapitaannum;optimal production;policy;previous cityscale;primary;primary data;production;production scenario;proliferation;proxy;proxy data;reduction;reductions;region;remediation;resources;revenue;s;scenarios;select;select farming;simulations;suburban;surveys;sustainability;technologies;tool;transport;u;uf;uf assessment;uf proliferation;ufs;ufs ability;ufs marginal;urban design;urban farming;urban sustainability;use;utilizing primary;vegetable;vegetable intake;water;water use,contributions;local farming;northeast;states;sustainability;united state;urban sustainability,288

Binary logit models are used here as econometric method to determine characteristics influencing the decision to diversify. Farm characteristics, which encourage the implementation of ""deepening"" strategies, are: larger farm sizes, high-value production, organic farming, and livestock production. By contrast, the consumer-oriented ""broadening"" strategies tourism services and care farming prevail on smaller farms and on farms with horses and higher grassland shares. Agricultural extension services increase the odds to diversify. The results of the conducted binary logistic regressions show increasing odds and predicted probabilities for ""deepening"" and ""broadening"" activities when approaching the city. Farms' location advantages close to cities can be used best when applying consumer-oriented ""deepening"" or ""broadening"" strategies; namely, direct sale or other short supply chains, tourism services, and care farming.

Few studies, however, have empirically assessed factors that influence urban community garden agrodiversity or its relationship to these dimensions of gardening. We conducted an interdisciplinary study of agrodiversity and cultural identity, based certain markers of identity, including how people see themselves with respect to race, ethnicity, or place of origin, in community gardens in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. We conducted fifty-six semistructured interviews with gardeners with different cultural identities in eight community gardens on their motivations for urban community gardening during 2014. We conducted plant inventories of the corresponding garden plots and found 104 cultivated edible and ornamental species and 28 varieties representing 34 families. We find that although gardens with culturally diverse gardeners did not have higher species richness, the cultural identity of the gardeners influenced species selection and reason for gardening. Further, the structure, design and species composition of garden plots reflected the identities of garden members. These finding have implications for the recent institutionalization of urban agriculture into city land policies in Philadelphia and other cities in North America.

This fact causes serious environmental and health problems due to the presence of contaminants and pathogens. Frequently, the use of specific low-cost strategies reduces the total amount of wastes. These strategies are mainly associated to the identification, separate collection and composting of specific organic waste streams, such as vegetable and fruit refuses from food markets and urban gardening activities. Concretely, in the Chimborazo Region (Ecuador), more than 80% of municipal solid waste is dumped into environment due to the lack of an efficient waste management strategy. Therefore, the aim of this study was to develop a demonstration project at field scale in this region to evaluate the feasibility of implanting the composting technology not only for the management of the organic waste fluxes from food market and gardening activities to be scaled-up in other developing regions, but also to obtain an end-product with a commercial value as organic fertilizer. Three co-composting mixtures were prepared using market wastes mixed with pruning of trees and ornamental palms as bulking agents. Two piles were created using different proportions of market waste and prunings of trees and ornamental palms: pile 1 (50:33:17) with a C/N ratio 25; pile 2: (60:30:10) with C/N ratio 24 and pile 3 (75:0:25) with C/N ratio 33), prepared with market waste and prunings of ornamental palm. Throughout the process, the temperature of the mixtures was monitored and organic matter evolution was determined using thermogravimetric and chemical techniques. Additionally, physico-chemical, chemical and agronomic parameters were determined to evaluate compost quality. The results obtained indicated that all the piles showed a suitable development of the composting process, with a significant organic matter decomposition, reached in a shorter period of time in pile 3. At the end of the process, all the composts showed absence of phytotoxicity and suitable agronomic properties for their use as organic fertilizers. This reflects the viability of the proposed alternative to be scaled-up in developing areas, not only to manage and recycle urban waste fluxes, but also to obtain organic fertilizers, including added value in economic terms related to nutrient contents",,organic fertilizer;organic matter;carbon;fertilizer;nitrogen;soil;article;composting;controlled study;decomposition;ecuador;food waste;gardening;nonhuman;nutrient content;organic waste;ornamental plant;phytotoxicity;recycling;temperature;tree pruning;analysis of variance;chemistry;city;economics;feasibility study;food;plant;procedures;soil;waste management;analysis of variance;carbon;cities;ecuador;feasibility studies;fertilizers;food;gardening;nitrogen;plants;recycling;soil;temperature;waste management,"Bustamante, M.A.; Dept. of Agrochemistry and Environment, Miguel Hernandez UniversitySpain; email: marian.bustamante@umh.es",,Public Library of Science,19326203,,POLNC,28727757.0,English,PLoS ONE,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85025073278,10,Ecuador;Spain,Ecuador,escuela superior politecnica de chimborazo;miguel hernandez university;escuela superior politecnica de chimborazo;universitat politecnica de catalunya;alicante university,escuela superior politecnica de chimborazo,absence;activities;agents;agronomic parameter;agronomic property;aim;alternative;amount;areas;bulking;bulking agent;cases;causes;chemical;chemical technique;chimborazo;chimborazo region;cn;collection;commercial value;compost;compost quality;composts;contaminants;contents;countries;decomposition;demonstration;demonstration project;development;different proportion;dumped;dumps;economic term;ecuador;efficient;efficient waste;end;endproduct;environment;evaluate;evaluate compost;evolution;fact;fact cause;feasibility;fertilizer;fertilizers;field;field scale;fluxes;food;food market;fruit;fruit refuse;gardening;gardening activity;health;health problem;identification;lack;lowcost;lowcost strategy;manage;management;management strategy;many case;market;market waste;markets;matter;matter decomposition;matter evolution;mixtures;nutrient;nutrient content;open dump;organic fertilizer;organic matter;organic waste;ornamental;ornamental palm;palm;palm pile;palms;parameters;pathogens;period;phytotoxicity;pile;piles;presence;problems;process;project;properties;proportions;prunings;quality;ratio;recycle;recycle urban;reduces;refuses;region;region ecuador;regions;results;scale;scaledup;separate collection;shorter;solid waste;specific lowcost;specific organic;strategies;strategy;strategy reduces;streams;study;suitable development;techniques;technology;temperature;terms;thermogravimetric;time;total amount;trees;urban gardening;urban waste;use;value;vegetable;viability;waste;waste flux;waste management;waste stream;wastes,development;ecuador;fertilizers;food;food market;gardening;market;market waste;organic fertilizer;urban gardening;waste,293

In addition, it has been estimated that by 2050, as much as 80 percent of the earths population will reside in cities [1]. As a consequence, new forms of food production have been explored, especially in places close to or even within the consumption areas, that is, cities. In this context, cities are evolving into intelligent infrastructures in which the aim is to automate, optimize, and improve all possible aspects, including urban agriculture and precision agronomy. Despite recent research efforts, common grounds still have to be defined in terms of how to efficiently automate and provide intelligence to the urban agriculture implementations and integrate those in a transparent and scalable manner to the overall smart city solutions. For this, we believe that smart cities must be conceptualized and abstracted on a higher and different plane than the supporting information and communications technology (ICT) infrastructure.

However, the associated potential impacts on the environment need to be evaluated using a recognized assessment methodology such as Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). Here, we set out to produce such references for tomatoes grown in urban gardens in Benin, and to examine how their impacts were affected by the variability of field emissions of reactive nitrogen, responsible for a major share of non-toxic impacts. A stratified sample of 12 fields was surveyed and used to design a representative mean for urban tomato gardens in Benin. To analyze the sensitivity of environmental impacts to management practices and environmental conditions, yields and nitrogen emissions from extreme scenarios were simulated with the crop model STICS. Overall, the environmental impacts of urban garden tomatoes in Benin were 4–23-fold greater than the impacts of tomatoes grown in European cropping systems, due to low and variable crop yields, high fuel consumption for irrigation, large emissions of nutrients and an excessive use of insecticides. For extreme scenarios, impacts were up to 3-fold greater than the impact of the representative mean as a result of complex biophysical mechanisms involved in nitrogen emissions. We concluded that parameters relative to irrigation (total rate and application frequency) and soil properties (pH, water holding capacity) should be included in the estimation of nitrogen emissions for LCA of vegetables. To reduce the impacts of urban garden systems, we recommend reducing fertilization to better fit to nutrient requirements with regard to potential yields, and avoiding a systematic use of insecticides",life-cycle assessment;modeling;nitrogen emissions;tomato;urban garden;variability,crops;developing countries;field emission;frequency estimation;fruits;insecticides;irrigation;life cycle;models;nitrogen;nutrients;sustainable development;vegetables;life cycle assessment (lca);nitrogen emissions;tomato;urban garden;variability;environmental impact,"Perrin, A.; USC GRAPPE, INRA Centre Angers-Nantes, Campus du Vegetal, 42 rue Georges Morel, France; email: aurelie.perrin@inra.fr",,Elsevier Ltd,09596526,,JCROE,,English,J Clean Prod,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85018353336,4,France,France,universite paris-saclay,universite paris-saclay,africa;analyze;application;application frequency;assessment;assessment lca;assessment methodology;benin;biophysical mechanism;capacity;cities;complex biophysical;conditions;consumption;countries;crop;crop model;crop yield;cycle;cycle assessment;design;development;emissions;environment;environment need;environmental condition;environmental impact;estimation;european cropping;examine;excessive use;extreme;extreme scenario;fertilization;field;field emission;fields;fit;frequency;fuel;fuel consumption;garden;garden system;garden tomato;gardens;grown;high fuel;impact;impacts;insecticides;irrigation;irrigation total;large emission;lca;leverage;life;life cycle;major share;management;management practice;mean;mechanisms;methodology;model;model stics;need;nitrogen;nitrogen emission;nontoxic;nontoxic impact;nutrient;nutrient requirement;nutrients;parameter relative;parameters;ph;potential impact;potential yield;powerful leverage;practices;produce;properties;property ph;rate;reactive;reactive nitrogen;recommend;references;regard;relative;representative;representative mean;requirements;result;sample;scenarios;sensitivity;set;share;soil;soil property;stics;sustainable development;systematic use;systems;tomato;tomato garden;tomato grown;tomatoes;total rate;urban farming;urban garden;urban tomato;use;variability;variable crop;vegetables;water;yields,benin;benin casestudy;casestudy;emissions;environmental impact;field;field emission;impacts;variability;vegetables,299

In Italy, urban gardens appeared for the first time in 1941 with the name “allotments of war,” during a period when lack of food established the ideal conditions for the cultivation of food in any vacant lot, especially in urban areas. Today, urban farming represents a new frontier of wellness, a viable response to the food crisis in terms of socioeconomic issues, and provides an instrument for combating material and immaterial poverty. Many Italian municipalities are now using a Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)-supported tool through which poor families or victims of unemployment can improve their own social statuses as well as their city.

In the growing cities and towns, there is an increasing need for food supplies, creating demand for agricultural products. High unemployment rates, urban poverty, and food and nutrition insecurity force some urban dwellers to partly adopt livelihood strategies based on urban agriculture. Presently in Kenya, urban and peri-urban agriculture plays an important role in urban food system, because it enhances livelihood strategies for urban households, not least the poor. Using a sample of 2,009 households, this study characterised urban farming and urban-based rural farming in medium-sized towns of Thika and Kisumu, Kenya. It further assessed food security levels of urban households engaged in farming and households that do not farm. Results demonstrate that more than half of the households produced part of their food, either in urban or rural areas. About 37 per cent and 25 per cent of the respondents produced food in rural and urban areas, respectively.

The workshops followed Max-Neef's Human Scale Development proposal that highlights the interdependence of social, economic and environmental systems and stresses the centrality of participatory processes and human needs satisfaction. This understanding of human development aligns with the approach to sustainable development popularised by the World Commission on Environment and Development in 1987, which called for the satisfaction of the needs of both current and future generations together with a balanced articulation of the social, economic and environmental dimensions of development. In practice, and even more so in times of economic crisis, governments are seen to prioritise the economic dimension over the environmental and the societal dimensions through their primary focus on policies to foster economic growth. However, people experiencing unemployment and poor economic prospects may not be in favour of this unbalanced, economic-driven approach. In Granada, participants in needs-based workshops did not emphasise the importance of economic prosperity and job creation when discussing policy goals and interventions to improve needs satisfaction. Economic interventions, such as providing universal coverage of basic needs, were seen as interdependent with personal and institutional transformations aimed at empowering workers and promoting citizen participation, and with environmental initiatives concerning the conservation of local natural spaces and the spread of urban gardening",empowerment;green economy;human scale development;participation;sustainable development;wellbeing,economics;employment;environmental protection;planning;empowerment;green economies;participation;scale development;wellbeing;sustainable development,"Guillen-Royo, M.; University of Oslo, Pb. 1108 Blindern, Norway; email: monica.guillen@sum.uio.no",,Elsevier Ltd,09596526,,JCROE,,English,J Clean Prod,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85016140586,3,Spain;Norway,Norway,university of oslo;department of applied economics;department of economic theory and history,university of oslo,aligns;analysis;approach;articulation;basic need;centrality;citizen;citizen participation;city;city hit;commission;conservation;coverage;creation;crisis;development;development aligns;development proposal;dimension;dimensions;discussing policy;economic crisis;economic dimension;economic growth;economic interventions;economic prospect;economic prosperity;emphasise;environment;environmental dimension;environmental initiative;environmental system;favour;focus;foster;future;future generation;gardening;generations;goals;governments;granada;growth;highlights;hit;human;human development;human need;human scale;illustrates;importance;initiative concerning;initiatives;institutional transformation;interdependence;interdependent;interventions;job;job creation;maxneefs;natural space;needs;paper;paper illustrates;participants;participation;participatory;participatory process;people;policies;policy;policy goal;practice;primary;primary focus;prioritise;processes;proposal;prospects;prosperity;satisfaction;scale;scale development;societal;societal dimension;spaces;spanish city;spread;stresses;sustainable development;systems;times;transformations;unemployment;universal;universal coverage;urban gardening;workers;workshops;world;world commission,crisis;development;economic crisis;granada;granada spain;illustration;spain;sustainable development;times,302

Conditions often worsen in summer with diminished access to healthy foods and safe venues for physical activity. Objective A public–private partnership was formed to develop and evaluate an integrative health intervention entitled “Mission Thrive Summer” (MTS). Methods The MTS setting was an urban farm and adjacent school in a low-income community in Baltimore, Maryland. The intervention included farming, nutrition education, cooking, physical activity, yoga, mindfulness, and employment. Mixed-methods outcomes evaluation was conducted. Quantitative measures included accelerometry and self-reported health behaviors, using the Child and Adolescent Mindfulness Measure, Perceived Stress Scale, Physical Activity Questionnaire for Adolescents (PAQA), CDC Youth Risk Behavior Survey, and Block Kids Food Screener (BKFS). Outcomes were compared pre- and post-intervention using paired t-tests. Qualitative evaluation was based on participant and parent interviews. Participants In total, 36 African-American 9th- and 10th-grade students joined MTS (17 in 2013, 26 in 2014, and 7 participating both years). Results In total, 88% of participants completed MTS. Accelerometry revealed that participants took 7158 steps and burned 544 calories per day during MTS. Participants experienced statistically significant improvements in self-reported physical activity (PAQA) and dietary habits (BKFS). Surveys did not detect changes in stress or mindfulness (P >.05). Qualitative data demonstrated new knowledge and skills, increased self-efficacy, health behavior change, and program enjoyment. Conclusions MTS was feasible among African-American high school students in Baltimore.

This paper examines this relationship through the case of urban ‘swiftlet farming’ in the UNESCO World Heritage city of George Town, Penang, Malaysia, which over the past 10 years has been transformed by the phenomenon. However, the industry has been fiercely resisted due to many issues, most notably for its alleged irreversible damage to the (in)tangible heritage of George Town and its abundance of pre-war heritage shophouses. Yet on the other hand, swiftlet farmers, have sought to legitimise their right to the city by arguing that swiftlets and the harvesting of their nests are in fact an integral part of Penang’s cultural, economic and natural heritage. In digging into these controversies, this paper focuses on the circulating discourses around ideas of what constitutes ‘heritage’, and ‘appropriate’ uses of urban space",cultural heritage;malaysia;urban farming;urban political ecology;urbanisation,cultural heritage;harvesting;landscape change;livestock farming;public space;unesco;urban agriculture;urban geography;urban society;urbanization;george town;malaysia;penang;penang island;west malaysia,"Connolly, C.; Geography, School of Environment, Education and Development, The University of ManchesterUnited Kingdom; email: ariccp@nus.edu.sg",,Routledge,01426397,,,,English,Landsc Res,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85013643712,1,United Kingdom;Singapore,United Kingdom,school of environment;asia research institute,school of environment,abundance;attention;case;change;city;constitutes;controversies;critical intersection;damage;date;discourses;examines;fact;farmers;farming’;focuses;george;george town;hand;heritage;heritage city;heritage shophouses;ideas;industry;intangible heritage;integral part;intersections;irreversible damage;issues;landscape;landscape change;legitimise;little attention;malaysia;many issue;natural heritage;nests;paid;paper;paper examines;paper focus;part;past;penang;penang’s;phenomenon;prewar;prewar heritage;relationship;right;shophouses;sought;space;swiftlet;swiftlet farmers;swiftlets;town;unesco;unesco world;urban heritage;urban space;urban ‘swiftlet;uses;world;world heritage;year;years;‘appropriate’;‘heritage’;‘swiftlet;‘swiftlet farming’,city;farming’;heritage;heritage city;heritage landscape;landscape;landscape politics;politics;world;world heritage;‘swiftlet;‘swiftlet farming’,304

The expansion of the production area can be done by planting watercress in polybag or other planting containers. In this way, watercress plants can be cultivated on land that was not originally agricultural land. The purpose of this study was to find out the rate of water and the type of planting material appropriate for growth and yield of watercress in pot. The experiment was conducted during January to April 2016 in screen house, Tanjung, Malang using factorial Randomized Block Design with three replications. Treatments used were planting material with 2 levels of plants i.e. seedlings (B1) and cuttings (B2) and five different water deficit levels including 25% field capacity (K25), 50% field capacity (K50), 75% field capacity (K75), 100% field capacity (K100) and 125% field capacity (K125). Results showed that there was significant interaction between rate of water and types of planting material. These interactions had significant influence on different variables, such as; plant length, number of leaves, leaf area, root length, root weight, plant weight, plant dry weight, crop growth rate, relative growth rate and yield. The results showed that the treatment of seed planting materials generally increased at all rate of water, except at the level 125% of field capacity where all variables declined. Treatment of cutting materials resulted in higher level of the water supply, the higher value of plant length, number of leaves, leaf area, plant fresh weight and plant dry weight, relative growth rate and watercress yield. Therefore, watercress cultivation in urban farming system can be planted in the pots or polybag, by using material planting of cutting and controling water content at field capacity",field capacity;planting material;urban farming;water deficit;watercress,,"Widaryanto, E.; Department of Agronomy, Faculty of Agriculture, Brawijaya University, Jl.

However, with the social, political and economic crisis especially in the European South urban agriculture is rapidly developing and becoming increasingly important for city dwellers. Drawing on a case-study of a municipal allotment garden in Northern Greece this article set out to explore the motives of urban dwellers for engaging in urban gardening. We elaborate a typology of gardeners using statistical analysis and Maslow's hierarchy of human needs. We then move from motives to placemaking and argue that despite the recent surge of gardens as places of production and satisfaction of basic level needs, new needs are emerging from lived experiences. Meanings, emotions and memories are embedded in the garden. Self-actualisation needs are fulfilled, new skills are developed and virtual communities are also grown. This symbiotic relationship of agriculture and the city has yet to reach its full potential in helping city dwellers to overcome what they are deprived of due to the crisis, not only material goods and social benefits but moreover a sense of belonging and self-respect",,crisis management;food production;garden city;statistical analysis;greece,"Partalidou, M.; Faculty of Agriculture, Forestry and Natural Environment Department of Agricultural Economics Laboratory of Agricultural Extention and Rural Sociology Aristotle University of Thessaloniki A.U.Th.

Using the city of Leipzig as a case study, we assess the effect of urban gardening type and intensity of management on ecosystem services and biodiversity by comparing allotment and community gardens. Employing a stratified sampling design, we assessed 30 allotment plots of different management intensity, including vacant plots, and six adjacent community gardens along a gradient of urbanity, using in-depth field surveys, remote sensing analyses and interviews. Our results show a bimodal relationship of overall vascular plant species richness with management intensity with highest species richness in medium intensively-managed plots, as they provide space for both cultivated edible and ornamental species as well as native, spontaneous species. In comparison to allotment gardens, community gardens provide a higher ratio of permeable soil surface and a slightly higher microbial soil activity, implying important differences in water regulation and nutrient cycling properties. With regard to climate regulation, old mature trees make a considerable contribution to above ground carbon storage, but are largely restricted to communal areas of the allotment estates due to code regulation. Based on our results, we discuss the impact of allotment gardening association codes and garden type and ways forward for gardeners and urban planners to promote biodiversity and ecosystem services provision",allotment gardens;biodiversity;community gardens;ecosystem services,biodiversity;carbon sequestration;ecosystem service;greenspace;nutrient cycling;ornamental species;remote sensing;soil microorganism;soil surface;species richness;water resource;germany;leipzig;saxony;tracheophyta,"Cabral, I.; German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research (iDiv) Halle-Jena-Leipzig, Deutscher Platz 5e, Germany; email: ines.cabral@idiv.de",,Elsevier GmbH,16188667,,,,English,Urban For Urban Greening,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85014500460,6,Germany,Germany,german centre for integrative biodiversity research (idiv) halle-jena-leipzig;martin luther university of halle-wittenberg;department of ecosystem services;department of systematic botany and functional biodiversity research;institute of ecology,german centre for integrative biodiversity research (idiv) halle-jena-leipzig,activity;adjacent;adjacent community;allotment;allotment estate;allotment garden;allotment gardening;allotment plot;analyses;areas;assess;association;association code;bimodal;bimodal relationship;biodiversity;carbon;carbon storage;case;case study;city;climate;climate regulation;code;code regulation;codes;communal;communal area;communities;community;community garden;comparison;considerable contribution;contribution;cycling;design;differences;different management;discuss;ecosystem;ecosystem service;effect;estates;field;field survey;garden;garden provide;garden type;gardeners;gardening;gardening association;gardening type;gardens;gradient;ground;ground carbon;habitat;habitat provision;impact;important difference;important ecosystem;indepth;indepth field;intensity;interviews;leipzig;local climate;management;management intensity;mature;mature tree;medium;microbial;microbial soil;nutrient;nutrient cycling;old mature;ornamental;ornamental specie;overall vascular;permeable soil;planners;plant;plant specie;plots;promote;promote biodiversity;properties;provide;provision;ratio;regard;regulation;relationship;remote;result show;results;richness;service provision;services;show;soil;soil activity;soil surface;space;specie richness;species;spontaneous species;storage;study;surface;surveys;trees;type;urban community;urban gardening;urban planner;urbanity;vacant;vacant plot;vascular;vascular plant;water;water regulation;way forward;ways,allotment;case;case study;community;community garden;ecosystem;ecosystem service;gardens;germany;germany case;leipzig;services;study,307

Despite the increasing importance of urban gardening for provisioning of food to urban populations, most urban gardeners suffer from high pest problems, and have little knowledge about how to manage their plots to increase biological control services. We examined the influence of local, garden scale (i.e., herbaceous and arboreal vegetation abundance and diversity, ground cover) and landscape (i.e., landscape diversity and surrounding land use types) characteristics on predation services provided by naturally occurring predators in 19 urban gardens in the California central coast. We introduced sentinel pests (moth eggs and larvae and pea aphids) onto greenhouse-raised plants taken to gardens and assigned to open or bagged (predator exclosure) treatments. We found high predation rates with between 40% and 90% of prey items removed in open treatments. Predation services varied with local and landscape factors, but significant predictors differed by prey species. Predation of eggs and aphids increased with vegetation complexity in gardens, but larvae predation declined with vegetation complexity. Smaller gardens experienced higher predation services, likely due to increases in predator abundance in smaller gardens. Several ground cover features influenced predation services. In contrast to patterns in rural agricultural landscapes, predation on aphids declined with increases in landscape diversity. In sum, we report the relationships between several local management factors, as well as landscape surroundings, and implications for garden management",agroecosystem;ants;biological control;lady beetles;spiders;trophic interactions,"abundance;agricultural ecosystem;agricultural land;ant;aphid;biocontrol agent;biological control;complexity;garden;ground cover;land use;landscape ecology;management practice;natural enemy;pest control;predation;rural landscape;species richness;spider;trophic interaction;urban population;california;united states;acyrthosiphon pisum;aphididae;araneae;coleoptera;formicidae;lepidoptera;animal;biological pest control;california;city;ecosystem;environmental protection;gardening;land use;predation;procedures;animals;california;cities;conservation of natural resources;ecosystem;gardening;gardens;pest control, biological;predatory behavior",,,Ecological Society of America,19395582,,ECAPE,28083983.0,English,Ecol Appl,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85017173408,2,United States,United States,department of environmental studies,department of environmental studies,abundance;agricultural landscape;agroecosystems;aphids;arboreal;arboreal vegetation;biological control;california;central coast;characteristics;coast;complexity;contrast;control;control service;cover;cover feature;diversity;e;eggs;enemy;enemy abundance;exclosure;exclosure treatment;factors;features;food;found;garden;garden management;garden scale;gardener suffer;gardeners;gardening;gardens;ground;ground cover;high pest;high predation;implications;importance;increase;increase biological;increases;influence;items;knowledge;land;land use;landscape;landscape diversity;landscape factor;landscape feature;landscape surroundings;landscapes;larva predation;larvae;little knowledge;local management;manage;management;management factor;moth;natural enemy;open treatment;patterns;pea;pea aphid;pest;pest problem;pests;plants;plots;populations;predation;predation rate;predation service;predator;predator abundance;predator exclosure;predators;predictors;prey;prey item;prey specie;problems;rates;relationships;report;result;richness;rural agricultural;scale;sentinel;sentinel pest;services;several ground;significant predictor;species;suffer;sum;surroundings;treatments;type characteristic;types;urban garden;urban gardener;urban gardening;urban population;use;use type;varied;vegetation;vegetation abundance;vegetation complexity,drivers;gardens;landscape;landscape driver;predation;predation service;services;urban garden,308

Apart from its acknowledged social benefits, urban farming is also widely viewed as a more resource-efficient alternative to conventional remote farming. Especially indoor, soilless cultivation in urban areas is being portrayed as a particularly sustainable solution. However, as this technique relies on controlled environments, its ongoing operation can be quite energy-intensive and related carbon emissions should be carefully weighed against reduced emissions, such as those from transportation. To further this goal, this article presents a simulation-based environmental analysis workflow for Building-Integrated Agriculture (BIA) in urban contexts, that includes detailed solar radiation, water and energy specific models. The aim of the workflow is to guide the user through decision-making on the potentialities of implementing BIA in a given neighborhood while maximizing crop yields and minimizing water and energy consumption. The workflow was applied to three hi-tech urban farming scenarios in Lisbon, Portugal: a polycarbonate Rooftop Greenhouse (RG), a Vertical Farm (VF) with windows and skylights on the top floor of a reinforced-concrete building as well as a completely opaque VF with no penetration of natural light on the ground floor of a reinforced-concrete building. Global Warming Potential (GWP) related to water, transportation and operational energy of these three case studies were compared to GWP of (i) the currently existing supply chain for tomato, and (ii) a hypothetical low-tech unconditioned rooftop urban farm. Results show that the RG and the top floor VF had the best overall environmental performance, respectively cutting greenhouse gas emissions in half and in three in comparison with the existing supply chain for tomato. By allowing this preliminary assessment of alternative farm locations and properties, the workflow provides the user with actionable information for early-stage holistic assessment of BIA projects",building-integrated agriculture (bia);controlled environment agriculture (cea);global warming potential (gwp);parametric simulation;performance-based design;resource efficiency,agriculture;buildings;carbon;concrete buildings;concretes;cultivation;decision making;decision support systems;emission control;energy utilization;environmental impact;environmental management;floors;fruits;gas emissions;global warming;greenhouse gases;reinforced concrete;structural design;supply chains;building integrated;controlled environment agricultures;global warming potential;parametric simulations;performance based design;resource efficiencies;urban transportation,"Benis, K.; IN+ Center for Innovation, Technology and Policy Research, Instituto Superior Tecnico, Avenida Rovisco Pais 1, Portugal; email: khadija.benis@tecnico.ulisboa.pt",,Elsevier Ltd,09596526,,JCROE,,English,J Clean Prod,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85013837289,3,Portugal;United States,Portugal,in+ center for innovation;massachusetts institute of technology (school of architecture + planning),in+ center for innovation,actionable information;agriculture;agriculture bia;aim;alternative;alternative farm;analysis;analysis workflow;areas;article;article present;assessment;benefits;bia;bia project;building;carbon;carbon emission;case;case study;chain;challenge;comparison;consumption;contexts;conventional remote;crop;crop yield;cultivation;current mode;detailed solar;earlystage;emissions;energy;energy consumption;energy specific;environmental analysis;environmental performance;environments;farm;farm location;farm vf;farming practice;floor;floor vf;food;gas;gas emission;global challenge;global warming;goal;greenhouse;greenhouse gas;greenhouse rg;ground;ground floor;guide;gwp;half;healthy food;hitech;holistic assessment;hypothetical lowtech;ii;indoor;information;largescale;largescale farming;light;lisbon;locations;lowtech;models;modes;natural light;neighborhood;ongoing operation;opaque;opaque vf;operation;operational energy;penetration;performance;polycarbonate;polycarbonate rooftop;population;portrayed;portugal;potential gwp;potentialities;practices;preliminary assessment;presents;projects;properties;radiation;reinforcedconcrete;reinforcedconcrete building;related carbon;relies;remote;remote farming;resourceefficient;resourceefficient alternative;result show;results;rg;rooftop;rooftop greenhouse;rooftop urban;scenarios;show;skylights;social benefit;soilless;soilless cultivation;solar;solar radiation;solution;specific model;studies;supply;supply chain;sustainable solution;technique;technique relies;time;tomato;top;top floor;transportation;unconditioned rooftop;urban area;urban context;urban farm;urban farming;urban population;user;vertical farm;vf;water;windows;workflow;worlds;yields,agriculture;agriculture bia;bia;contexts;decision;decision support;development;implementation;support;support workflow;urban context;workflow,310

The World Health Organization classifies brucellosis as a neglected zoonotic disease that is rarely in the spotlight for research and mainly affects poor, marginalized people. Urban and peri-urban farming is a common practice in many low-income countries, and it increases the incomes of families that are often restrained by limited economic resources. However, there is a concern that the growing number of people and livestock living close together in these areas will increase the transmission of zoonotic pathogens such as Brucella. This study investigates the presence of Brucella DNA in bovine milk in the urban and peri-urban area of Dushanbe, Tajikistan. Brucella DNA was detected in 10.3% of 564 cow milk samples by IS711-based real-time PCR. This finding is concerning because consumption of unpasteurized dairy products is common in the region. Furthermore, Brucella DNA was detected in the milk of all seropositive cows, but 8.3% of the seronegative cows also showed the presence of Brucella DNA. In addition, sequence analysis of the rpoB gene suggests that one cow was infected with B. abortus and another cow was most likely infected with B. melitensis. The discrepancies between the serology and real-time PCR results highlight the need to further investigate whether there is a need for implementing complementary diagnostic strategies to detect false serological negative individuals in Brucella surveillance, control, and eradication programmes. Furthermore, vaccination of cattle with S19 in addition to vaccination of small ruminants with Rev 1 might be needed in order to control Brucella infections in the livestock population but further research focusing on the isolation of Brucella is required to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the Brucella spp. circulating among the livestock in this region",,"article;bacterial gene;brucellosis;controlled study;dairy product;dna sequence;electrophoresis;enzyme linked immunosorbent assay;health hazard;nonhuman;nucleotide sequence;real time polymerase chain reaction;rpob gene;sequence analysis;serodiagnosis;seroprevalence;tajikistan;urban area;agriculture;animal;bovine;brucella;classification;genetics;human;isolation and purification;microbiology;milk;prevalence;suburban population;urban population;bacterial dna;dna directed rna polymerase;rna polymerase beta subunit;agriculture;animals;brucella;cattle;dna, bacterial;dna-directed rna polymerases;humans;milk;prevalence;real-time polymerase chain reaction;sequence analysis, dna;suburban population;tajikistan;urban population","Magnusson, U.; Department of Clinical Sciences, Division of Reproduction, Swedish University of Agricultural SciencesSweden; email: ulf.magnusson@slu.se",,Public Library of Science,19352727,,,28296882.0,English,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85017024841,8,Norway;Sweden;Tajikistan;Belgium,Sweden,department of clinical sciences;department of medical biochemistry and microbiology;veterinary and agrochemical research center;department of arctic and marine biology;center for national collection of pathogenic microorganisms;department of biomedical sciences and veterinary public health,department of clinical sciences,abortus;addition;affects;analysis;area;areas;asia;asia remains;b;bovine;bovine milk;brucella;brucella dna;brucella hotspot;brucella infection;brucella spp;brucella surveillance;brucellosis;cattle;central asia;classifies;common practice;common zoonosis;complementary;complementary diagnostic;comprehensive;comprehensive understanding;concern;consumption;control;control brucella;countries;cow;cow milk;cows;dairy;dairy product;detect;diagnostic strategy;discrepancies;disease;dna;dushanbe;economic resource;eradication;eradication programme;false serological;families;gene;gene suggests;health;health organization;highlight;hotspot;incomes;increase;increases;individuals;infections;investigate;investigates;is711based realtime;isolation;livestock;livestock living;livestock population;living;lowincome;lowincome country;many lowincome;melitensis;milk;milk sample;need;negative individual;number;order;organization;organization classifies;pathogens;pcr;pcr result;people;periurban;periurban area;periurban farming;population;practice;presence;products;programmes;realtime;realtime pcr;region;remains;research;resources;result highlight;results;rev;rpob;rpob gene;ruminants;s19;samples;sequence;sequence analysis;serological negative;serology;seronegative;seronegative cow;seropositive;seropositive cow;small ruminant;spotlight;spp;strategies;study;study investigates;suggests;surveillance;tajikistan;transmission;unpasteurized dairy;vaccination;world;world health;zoonoses;zoonotic disease;zoonotic pathogen,bovine;bovine milk;brucella;brucella spp;characterization;detection;milk;periurban;periurban farming;smallscale;spp;tajikistan,311

As responses to current environmental conditions, urban farming literature such as Farm City and The Vertical Farm, as Anthropocene narratives, occupy powerful positions in configurations of the history and future of the Earth. While Anthropocene narratives often adopt an apocalyptic tone, are intimately tied to issues of climate change, and warn of the planet's bleak prospects, Farm City and The Vertical Farm present a brighter vision wherein human agency is redeemed as the driving force behind environmental reform and celebrate stewardship and technological innovation. Calling attention to cities and farming, urban farming intervenes into apocalyptic Anthropocene visions by suggesting an agrarianism that celebrates small family farming and an ethic of interconnectedness, on the one hand, and vertical farming and techno-scientific stewardship, on the other, as alternatives to a history of loss and recovery. The currency of urban farming brings to the fore an Anthropocene future wherein cities and farming are redeemed from their villainous status and conceptualized as human-created geological forces embodying an ideal of human-nonhuman interdependen",anthropocene;farm city;the city;the vertical farm;urban agriculture,,"Chou, S.S.; Institute of European and American Studies, Academia SinicaTaiwan",,National Taiwan Normal University,17296897,,,,English,Concentric,Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85018580732,1,Taiwan,Taiwan,institute of european and american studies,institute of european and american studies,21st century;adopt;agency;agrarianism;alternatives;american medium;anthropocene;anthropocene future;anthropocene vision;apocalyptic anthropocene;apocalyptic tone;attention;bestselling;bleak;bleak prospect;brighter;brighter vision;brings;carpenter farm;carpenters;celebrate;celebrate stewardship;celebrates;century;change;cities;city;climate;climate change;conditions;configurations;coverage;currency;despommiers;dickson;dickson despommiers;earth;education;environmental condition;environmental reform;essay;essay examines;examines;family;farm;farm city;farm feeding;farm present;farmer;farming literature;force;forces;fore;future;future wherein;geological force;hand;history;human;human agency;humannonhuman;humannonhuman interdependen;ideal;innovation;interconnectedness;interdependen;intervenes;issues;literature;loss;media;narratives;novella;novella carpenter;occupy;planet bleak;planets;positions;powerful position;present;prospects;recovery;reform;responses;small family;status;stewardship;technological innovation;technoscientific;technoscientific stewardship;tone;urban farmer;urban farming;vertical farm;vertical farming;villainous status;vision;vision wherein;visions;warn;wherein;wherein human;world,agrarianism;agriculture;anthropocene;anthropocene futurity;city;city urban;futurity;urban agriculture,312

Alongside proliferation of the alternative food projects that characterize civic agriculture, growing literature critiques how their implementation runs counter to the ideal of civic agriculture. This study assesses the relevance of three such critiques to urban farming, aiming to understand how different farming models balance civic and economic exchange, prioritize food justice, and create socially inclusive spaces. Using a case study approach that incorporated interviews, participant observation, and document review, I compare two urban farms in Baltimore, Maryland—a “community farm” that emphasizes community engagement, and a “commercial farm” that focuses on job creation. Findings reveal the community farm prioritizes civic participation and food access for low-income residents, and strives to create socially inclusive space. However, the farmers’ “outsider” status challenges community engagement efforts. The commercial farm focuses on financial sustainability rather than participatory processes or food equity, reflecting the use of food production as a means toward community development rather than propagation of a food citizenry. Both farms meet authentic needs that contribute to neighborhood improvement, though findings suggest a lack of interest by residents in obtaining urban farm food, raising concerns about its appeal and accessibility to diverse consumers.

Small-scale agriculture located in urban areas is a highly effective and profitable way to provide these products to communities that are far from extensive commercial agricultural areas. Here we describe how remote sensing can be used with data mining approaches to monitor urban and peri-urban farms within cities in both developed and developing countries. Using very high resolution satellite imagery together with moderate and coarse resolution imagery and information from social media and the web, we analyze the usefulness of different methods to identify farms within urban boundaries in four countries. The analysis shows how a mixed-method approach is necessary in order to identify where urban farming is occurring and to monitor its change through time. Although remote sensing-based vegetation and water indices were useful, without ancillary data they are not effective at remotely mapping the locations of urban farms.

I offer a supplementary lens and story of change at Cornell University as a cautionary and motivational tale. I concur with the authors who want to redirect faculty, departments, and societies of agricultural educators to become more tightly aligned with the sciences. The need for and ability to better contribute to the critical discussions on contemporary agriculture issues (e.g., urban farming, GMOs, sustainability, local economies) is timely and important. The trick, however, is to do this without weakening the agricultural education community to the point of extinction. Drawing on Institutional Theory, I offer an enhanced perspective highlighting the importance of resource, conformity, and legitimacy. I explore the nature of competing pressures: the strong and restrictive ties to isolated communities and the pressure to reengage a community with a more socially and intellectually central world. I want to emphasize how these strong ties are typically beneficial to the organizations of interest, despite what it may look like to others outside that sector.

It questions the view of urban gardening as a manifestation of citizens’ dissensus towards administration’s institutional planning, and the expression of urban ‘counterplanning’ whose aim is to resist the consequences of a neoliberal governmentality. Although this interpretation of urban gardening is to a certain extent true, it does not completely explain some current developments in socio-spatial planning practices. In order to fill this gap, the article advances a theoretical analysis of the emerging governmentality generated by an intensified relationship between institutional, private and community actors. The theoretical analysis is complemented by the example of representative urban gardening projects in Ghent, a dynamic and inspiring mid-size city in Belgium, providing an ideal context for exploring the transformation of planning practices and their socio-political underpinnings. The article concludes that urban gardening practices exemplify an emerging informal mode of planning supported by a new transactive governmentality, which may lead to a co-creative transformation of public urban space",counterplanning;ghent;governmentality;informal planning;neoliberal city;urban gardening,community resource management;garden city;governance approach;greenspace;neoliberalism;planning theory;project management;theoretical study;urban planning;belgium;east flanders;ghent,"Certoma, C.; DIRPOLIS Institute and Institute of Management, Scuola Superiore Sant’Anna, Pz.

We performed a multi-elemental analysis with several common edible crops (cucumber, pepper, cabbage, and lettuce) and poplar grown directly on a titanium ore landfill as a maximized scenario of exposure. Despite elevated concentrations of soil Ca, Fe, Mn, and Ti resulting from the industrial process, we did not register higher accumulation of these elements in the edible parts of crops or in poplar leaves grown on red gypsum compared with the control soil. Only S concentrations were higher in plants grown on the red gypsum, especially for cabbage. The principal component analysis among elements for plants grown on red gypsum indicated that S and Mn were accumulated by different plant species than Cd, Cu, and Zn. The poplar clone had a significantly higher transfer of S and Cr than the control and is a suitable tree species for monitoring element transfer to vegetation in this industrial context. By comparing our data with tolerable daily intake (TDI) recommendations, we demonstrated the low risk of cultivating edible crops directly on an industrial substrate in a maximized scenario of exposure, except for Cr, for which the toxicity depends on the bioavailable form. However, we did not consider the cumulative effects of the various elements because there are no current guidelines, and further research is needed to address this question",icp-aes;poplar;titanium industry;tolerable daily intake;trace metals;transfer;urban gardening;vegetable crops,"bioaccumulation;biological uptake;canola;concentration (composition);crop plant;deciduous tree;edible species;gypsum;heavy metal;landfill;pollution exposure;pollution monitoring;titanium;trace element;vegetable;vine;brassica oleracea var. capitata;cucumis sativus;lactuca;heavy metal;soil;soil pollutant;titanium;trace element;analysis;brassica;chemistry;crop;lettuce;plant leaf;populus;soil;soil pollutant;vegetable;waste disposal facility;brassica;crops, agricultural;lettuce;metals, heavy;plant leaves;populus;soil;soil pollutants;titanium;trace elements;vegetables;waste disposal facilities","Parelle, J.; Laboratoire Chrono-Environnement, UMR CNRS 6249, Universite de Bourgogne Franche-Comte, 16 Route de Gray, France; email: michel.chalot@univ-fcomte.fr",,Springer Verlag,09441344,,ESPLE,28000070.0,English,Environ Sci Pollut Res,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85006750959,5,France,France,laboratoire chrono-environnement;laboratoire chrono-environnement;laboratoire interdisciplinaire des environnements continentaux;universite de lorraine,laboratoire chrono-environnement,accumulation;address;analysis;bioavailable form;cabbage;cd;clone;component;component analysis;concentrations;context;control;control soil;cr;crop cucumber;crops;cu;cucumber;cumulative effect;current guideline;data;depends;development;different plant;edible crop;edible part;effects;element;element transfer;elements;experienced rapid;exposure;fe;form;gardening;grown;guidelines;gypsum;industrial context;industrial process;industrial substrate;industry;industry need;intake;intake tdi;landfill;leaf grown;leaves;lettuce;low risk;mn;monitoring;monitoring element;multielemental;multielemental analysis;needs;ore;ore landfill;parts;pepper;plant;plant grown;plant specie;plants;poplar;poplar clone;poplar grown;poplar leaf;principal;principal component;process;question;rapid development;recommendations;red gypsum;register;research;risk;scenario;soil;species;substrate;suitable tree;tdi;tdi recommendation;ti;titanium;titanium ore;toxic;toxic element;toxicity;toxicity depends;transfer;tree;tree specie;urban gardening;various element;vegetation;zn,accumulation;crops;edible crop;elements;grown;landfill;ore;ore landfill;poplar;poplar grown;titanium;titanium ore;trace;trace element,317

In 2015, a cross-sectional study was conducted in 79 pig farms to estimate farm-level prevalence of helminth eggs using McMaster technique and protozoan parasite oocysts using the Modified Ziehl–Neelsen technique in Morogoro municipality, Tanzania. Farm-level representative samples of manure were collected from pig manure disposal sites in each farm. Pig farmers’ knowledge and practices related to pig husbandry and manure handling were assessed using a structured questionnaire. All pigs were reared indoors and their manures were handled in solid form. Farm-level prevalence of strongyle eggs was 7.6% (95% CI: 1.8, 13.4) and that of Ascaris spp. was 6.3% (95% CI: 0.9, 11.7). Prevalence of acid-fast protozoan oocysts was 6.3% (95% CI: 0.9, 11.7), includingIsospora spp., Cryptosporidium spp. and Eimeria spp. Approximately 27.8% (95% CI: 17.9, 37.7) of the samples had acid-fast objects that resembled microsporidia and other fungal spores. About 94.9% (95% CI: 90.0, 99.8) of the farmers reported to have experienced diseases in their pigs, commonly helminthosis. Only about 42.5% (95% CI: 31.3, 53.9) believed that pig manure could cause some human health problems. Approximately, 65.3% (54.3, 76.3) reported to clean their pig pens daily. About 61.1% (95% CI: 49.9, 72.3) reported to wear special clothing when removing pig manure.

The construction of vertical buildings in Sleman district is growing rapidly together with the increasing demand for the provision of housing and public facilities. The rapid physical development in Sleman has caused the reduction of green land such as green open space (RTH), agricultural land and rice fields. These developments potentially threaten food security in Sleman district. Urban farming is a method of agricultural activities to reduce the problems of agricultural land limitation in urban areas, like Sleman district. The construction design model of urban farming on the vertical building envelope is one aspect of green building that will support the efforts in vertical farming processes. This showed that the method did not require any horizontally ground space but effectively used the vertical space on the building envelope, including wall and building roof features and construction. In fact, the urban farming construction method will not only contribute to productive agricultural activities, but also support the greening of the urban area as well as reduce the crisis of agricultural land issues.

This paper also describes the role of the community to achieve the environmental, economic and social sustainability for the enhancement of the urban environment and healthy lifestyles through community participation in food supplies, nutrition, and spaces utilization. The paper evaluates the benefits and potential of urban farming activities within limited urban spaces and how it improves the quality of life. It also reviews on how urban farming is beneficial to the society due to food shortage crisis which is inadequate for the whole population. It is necessary to apply and practice in our daily lives for the consumption of food security, human safety, and health. Therefore, the role of community is very crucial in the implementation of urban farming activities within urbanized areas as the demand for green development increases.

Various sensors, actuators, microcontroller, and microprocessor were employed in the system to monitor and control water quality, light intensity, and fish feed. To ensure healthy growing environment for fish and plant, early warnings in form of email, short message service, and push notification are automatically sent to the user when the sensor detects any abnormal condition. Concurrently, the respective actuator will intervene and rectify the abnormal condition without human interference. Moreover, fish feed is dispensed at the user preset timings of the day. All system activities and live sensor measurements are securely stored in a cloud storage for data analysis. User-friendly web and mobile applications were also created to provide graphical user interfaces between the aquaponics system and the user. Additionally, the user can monitor the aquaponics facilities live from web application through a camera module of the system. As such, the proposed smart aquaponics system has demonstrated to be a self-sustainable, cost-effective, and eco-friendly urban farming that can attract commercial farmers and home gardeners",aquaponics;food sustainability;internet of things;urban farming,actuators;cost effectiveness;digital storage;fish;food supply;internet of things;meats;quality control;sustainable development;user interfaces;water quality;abnormal conditions;aquaponics;growing environments;mobile applications;monitor and control;sensor measurements;short message services;urban farming;graphical user interfaces,"Ng, A.K.; Singapore Institute of Technology, 10 Dover Drive, Singapore; email: Andrew.Ng@SingaporeTech.edu.sg",Chou S.K.Yan J.Nian V.Yan J.Li H.,Elsevier Ltd,18766102,,,,English,Energy Procedia,Conference Paper,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85040833492,2,Singapore,Singapore,univeristy of glasgow singapore;singapore institute of technology,univeristy of glasgow singapore,abnormal condition;activities;actuator;actuators;analysis;application;applications;aquaponics;attempts;attract;camera;camera module;cloud;cloud storage;commercial farmer;concern;condition;control;control water;costeffective;data;day;design;detects;email;environment;facilities;farmers;feed;fish;fish farming;fish feed;food;food production;food security;form;gardeners;graphical user;home;home gardener;human;human interference;intensity;interfaces;interference;intervene;land;land scarcity;leafy;leafy vegetable;light;light intensity;live sensor;local food;major concern;measurements;message;message service;microcontroller;microprocessor;mobile;mobile application;module;monitor;moreover;notification;paper;paper attempt;plant;preset;preset timing;productions;provide;push;push notification;quality;rapid urbanization;respective;respective actuator;scarcity;security;sensor;sensor detects;sensor measurement;sensors;sent;service;short message;singapore;smart;smart aquaponics;storage;sustainability;system;system activity;timings;urban farming;urbanization;user;user interface;user preset;various sensors;vegetables;warnings;water;water quality;web;web application,aquaponics;smart;smart aquaponics;system;urban farming,325

Rural-based agriculture though remains the thrust of food supply system for household consumption in Nigeria; urban residents in the country have on the other hand undergone exploration of the urban environment for farm enterprise production for home consumption and sometimes income generation. As established in several literatures on urban agriculture, the practice is though common among the average to low income earners, particularly in the developing countries, it is a global phenomenon with varying trends of production systems. In the developed countries, controlled urban agriculture system, which takes the form of zero-acreage - vertical farming, hydroponic, aeroponics, aquaponics, skyfarming; is widely practised. In addition to this is the practise of uncontrolled urban agriculture system, which takes the form of open space agriculture - community gardens, vegetable gardens, container farming and homestead gardening; in both the developed and developing countries. In the Nigerian context, some individuals though experiment with vertical farming; the general trend of production is open space or soil/land-based farming system for crop and animal production. In view of this, urban farming system in the country largely takes the form of home gardening and surrounding/environment farming. The production system under these farming systems thus takes the form of upland or lowland farming, solely crop or livestock production, and crop-livestock integration. The crop production systems are however rain-fed with the use of hoes and cutlasses as farming tools. Although most of the Nigerian urban agriculture practitioners largely produced for home consumption, a few of them do so for income generation through marketing of harvested or surplus farm produce. Direct impact of urban farming on the Nigerian households include guaranteed food supply or food supplementation, employment and income generation, environmental hygiene and social relation build-up. By means of the generated income from urban farming, indirect impacts of the practice include livelihood asset acquisition and other essential household needs. This notwithstanding, the urban agriculture practice is challenged by factors such as competitive demand for land, hindered by little or no pro-urban agriculture development policy or none inclusion in urban development plans, pilferage and stealing of farm produce, loss of farm animals to nature, cost of production and health management of the animals. To mitigate the effects of the production challenges, the farming households have intuitively developed innovative actions for sustenance of urban farming and enhanced productivity. The actions include intensive cultivation of available space, sourcing for lands outside their loci of residents, adoption of manual irrigation system and mulching practices, provision of security for protection of cultivated crops and raised animals, culling of sick animals and collection of dried by-produce for dry season feeding of the farm animals. In view of this, urban farming in Nigeria has withstood the test of time such that it has become sustained, and even becoming pervasive among the urban dwellers. It is however recommended that a pro-urban agriculture policy should be included in the urban development policy and architectural plans for enhancement of urban agriculture practice in Nigeria",actions and nigeria;challenges;impacts;innovative production;production system;urban agriculture,animals;crops;cultivation;developing countries;food supply;sustainable development;urban growth;challenges;impacts;nigeria;production system;urban agricultures;farms,"Lawal-Adebowale, O.A.; Department of Agricultural Extension and Rural Development, Federal University of Agriculture AbeokutaNigeria; email: lawal-adebowaleoa@funaab.edu.ng",,"Nova Science Publishers, Inc.",,9781536110166; 9781536110128,,,English,Agric Res Updat,Book Chapter,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85020323745,1,Nigeria,Nigeria,department of agricultural extension and rural development,department of agricultural extension and rural development,acquisition;actions;addition;adoption;aeroponics;agricultural development;agriculture;agriculture community;agriculture development;agriculture policy;agriculture practice;agriculture practitioner;agriculture system;animal;animal production;animals;aquaponics;architectural plan;asset;asset acquisition;available space;become;buildup;byproduce;challenged;challenges;collection;community;community garden;competitive demand;consumption;container;context;cost;countries;country;crop;crop production;croplivestock;croplivestock integration;crops;cultivation;cutlasses;demand;developed;developed country;development;development plan;development policy;development strategy;direct impact;dry;dry season;dwellers;earners;effects;employment;enhancement;enterprise;enterprise production;environment;environmental hygiene;essential household;experiment;exploration;factors;farm;farm animal;farm enterprise;farm produce;food;food security;food supplementation;food supply;form;gardening;gardens;general trend;generated income;generation;global phenomenon;guaranteed;hand;hand undergone;health;health management;healthy living;hoes;home;home consumption;home gardening;homestead;homestead gardening;household;household consumption;household food;household need;households;hydroponic;hygiene;impact;impacts;include;include livelihood;inclusion;income;income earner;income generation;indirect;indirect impact;individuals;innovative action;integration;intensive cultivation;irrigation;irrigation system;land;lands;literatures;livelihood;livelihood asset;livestock;livestock production;living;loci;loss;low income;lowland;lowland farming;man survival;management;mans;manual irrigation;marketing;means;mitigate;mulching practice;nature;needs;nigeria;nigerian context;nigerian household;nigerian urban;none;none inclusion;open space;pervasive;phenomenon;pilferage;plans;policy;practice;practices;practise;practitioners;produce;production;production challenge;production system;productivity;protection;prourban;prourban agriculture;provision;rainfed;relation;relation buildup;remains;residents;season;season feeding;security;series;several literature;sick;sick animal;social relation;space;space agriculture;strategies;supplementation;supply;supply system;surplus;surplus farm;surroundingenvironment;surroundingenvironment farming;survival;sustainable household;sustenance;system;systems;test;thrust;time;tools;trend;trends;uncontrolled urban;undergone;undergone exploration;upland;urban agriculture;urban development;urban dweller;urban environment;urban farming;urban resident;use;value;vegetable;vegetable gardens;vertical farming;view;withstood;zeroacreage,actions;agriculture;agriculture practice;dynamics;impacts;innovative action;nigeria;practice;production;sustainability;urban agriculture,326

This makes a garden comparable to a micro-social ecosystem, different from other gardens and ever changing. As with every social-ecosystem resulting from a territorialisation process, there is a certain degree of social inertia that makes it difficult for outsiders with new motivations and demanding new spaces to enter into the ""garden ecosystem"". Drawing on existing literature and fieldwork in two urban communal gardens in Turin, the paper is mainly concerned with the spatiotemporal dimension of urban gardening, with a special focus on governance aspects. In particular, the article offers insights about the involvement of the governance process in the dynamics of urban allotment gardens and looks at the impact of regulations. Despite being areas with a limited extension, the complex nature of the structural coupling of the relationship among gardeners and the assigned allotment, makes it clear that urban garden management is far from being unproblematic. The attempt to govern and manage the phenomenon by the local government and promoting associations often represents a real challenge in terms of adaptability and response to a phenomenon in constant evolution and fully inserted in the urban transition. This is a process characterized, on the one hand, by internal, conservative resistance and, on the other hand, by pressures asking for social change and innovation from the outside.

Around 50% of the urban area is green space, which includes 630 farms and a constantly growing number of community gardens. Not only do activists try to reclaim the city by cultivating vegetables on fallow land, but even the new urban development plan presents urban gardening as an ""innovative impulse"" for the city. At the same time, agricultural spaces are increasingly under pressure due to population growth and a construction boom. This paper offers a thorough analysis of the implications of neoliberal urban development for agricultural spaces and practices in Vienna. Combining theoretical work on urban neoliberalization with a governmentality approach makes it possible to focus not only on transnational transformations, but also to shed light on specific developments and concrete acts of governing at the local scale.

The general objective of this paper was to determine the new socio-spatial configuration into which these experiences have been implemented, in order to determine the diversity of actors involved in urban agriculture (UA) within the municipality of Perugia. Secondary objectives were to explore the social and environmental capital produced and to indicate orientations and suggestions to enhance the impact of UA within the city. The survey, conducted during 2015 and 2016, focused on seven UA initiatives or projects and demonstrated that there is an increasing social demand for the reintegration of agriculture within urban areas. At the same time, there is a lack of coordination between the different initiatives, plans, and programmes to enhance these projects. It is necessary to take advantage of the intense activity, creativity, ideas, and actors involved in UA to improve the connections and synergy to implement these initiatives.

As land resources for agriculture decrease, policy makers are faced with the challenge of sustainability and feeding the rapidly growing world population which is projected to reach approximately 9.7 billion in 2050. Solutions for improving future food production are exemplified by urban vertical farming which involves much greater use of technology and automation for land-use optimization. The vertical farm strategy aims to significantly increase productivity and reduce the environmental footprint within a framework of urban, indoor, climate- controlled high-rise buildings. It is claimed that such facilities offer many potential advantages as a clean and green source of food, along with biosecurity, freedom from pests, droughts, and reduced use of transportation and fossil fuels.

Basing on definitions developed by researchers such as U. Giseke (agroforopolis, beautiful productive landscapes), A. Viljoen, K. Bohn and J. Howe (productive urban landscapes), F. Lohrberg, L.

But despite growing research on non-institutional forms of political participation like food activism (Counihan and Siniscalchi, 2014), political consumerism 1 (Stolle and Micheletti, 2013), and digital citizenship (Bennett, 2008; Swigger, 2013), these literatures rarely relate to each other. This raises a challenge when attempting to understand how different forms of non-institutional political participation are interconnected. For example, it is unclear whether and how practices such as signing an e-petition, purchasing organic food, and taking part in local urban farming initiatives interrelate. To explore these non-institutional forms of political participation in relation to one another and to more conventional forms of political participation like voting, Van Deth (2014) has suggested that these forms of participation, which take place in the private or semi-public sphere, should be conceptualized as lifestyle politics (Giddens, 1991).

Urbanisation has multiple political, cultural, environmental and economic dimensions that profoundly influence social development and innovation. This fundamental long-term transformation will involve the realignment of urban society’s technologies and infrastructures, culture and lifestyles, as well as governance and institutional frameworks. Such structural systemic realignments can be referred to as urban sustainability transitions: fundamental and structural changes in urban systems through which persistent societal challenges are addressed, such as shifts towards urban farming, renewable decentralised energy systems, and social economies. This book provides new insights into how sustainability transitions unfold in different types of cities across the world and explores possible strategies for governing urban transitions, emphasising the co-evolution of material and institutional transformations in socio-technical and socio-ecological systems. With case studies of mega-cities such as Seoul, Tokyo, New York and Adelaide, medium-sized cities such as Copenhagen, Cape Town and Portland, and nonmetropolitan cities such as Freiburg, Ghent and Brighton, the book provides an opportunity to reflect upon the comparability and transferability of theoretical/conceptual constructs and governance approaches across geographical contexts.

Our findings highlight the fact that as urban agriculture struggles to find permanent locations, temporary open spaces are made available by urban regeneration processes. Some initiatives have come to terms with this precarity of land access and have adapted to it by taking advantage of the plant and animal properties that allow temporary and nomadic farming and relocation of gardens. This has led to the burgeoning of new subtypes of urban agriculture initiatives over the past decade. Our case study of shared gardens shows that the revival of urban farming and gardening is not due to the resurgence of permanent land access that prevailed for traditional family gardens establishment but to the re-negotiation of land access temporality institutionalised by municipal policy. Itillustrates a new form of public action where ""temporary gardened urbanism"" prevails and reflects the commoditization of urban rhythms and spaces, and ultimately leads to the displacement of gardens, without guaranteeing the survival of the gardeners' community. But the case of Paris and its suburbs also provide a good case to study how inhabitants' initiatives can grow in the urban fabric outside the national allotment policy frame, creating new temporary places and nomadic activities that can outlast the timeframe imposed by neoliberal temporary urbani",nomadic gardening;paris;shared gardens;temporary urbanism;urban agriculture,,,,Okanagan University College,14929732,,,,English,ACME,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85026505776,2,France,France,universite paris-est creteil-val de marne;universite paris 8,universite paris-est creteil-val de marne,access;access temporality;action;activities;advantage;agriculture;agriculture initiative;agriculture struggle;allotment;allotment policy;animal;animal property;article;article illustrates;case;case study;commoditization;community;decade;displacement;dynamics;economy;establishment;fabric;fact;family;family garden;findings;form;frame;garden establishment;garden show;gardener community;gardeners;gardening;gardens;good case;grow;highlight;illustrates;impact;inhabitant initiative;inhabitants;initiatives;itillustrates;land;land access;land regulation;leads;locations;municipal policy;national allotment;neoliberalization;new form;new subtypes;nomadic activity;nomadic farming;open space;outlast;ownership;ownership structure;paris;past;past decade;permanent;permanent land;permanent location;places;plant;policy;policy frame;precarity;prevails;processes;properties;provide;public;public action;regeneration;regeneration process;regulation;relocation;renegotiation;resurgence;revival;rhythms;shift;shows;spaces;structures;struggles;study;subtypes;suburbs;survival;temporality;temporary place;temporary urbani;terms;timeframe;traditional family;urban agriculture;urban economy;urban fabric;urban farming;urban regeneration;urban rhythm;urbani;urbanism;urbanism prevails,agriculture;city;gardening;move;neoliberal city;paris;routes;temporary gardening;urban agriculture,337

Despite several associated benefits, growing vegetables in urban gardens that are localized in highly polluted areas poses questions about the safety of the produced food. Therefore, the identification of risk factors that result in possible deleterious effects to human health is important for realizing all of the benefits to society. We evaluated the use of two biomonitoring methods in ten urban gardens of Sao Paulo city and one control site: the micronuclei frequencies for early tetrads of Tradescantia pallida (Rose) Hunt. cv. “Purpurea” Boom (hereafter, Trad-MCN) as a short-term indicator of genotoxic response and tree barks to quantify the accumulation of traffic-related chemical elements as a long-term biomarker of air pollution in urban gardens. Mature plants of Tradescantia pallida were exposed in each garden, and their inflorescences were sampled over three months. A random set of 300 early tetrads in 13 to 21 slides per garden were evaluated for micronuclei frequencies. Elemental concentrations in 428 tree barks samples from 107 different trees in the areas surrounding urban gardens were quantified using an energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence spectrometer. The frequency of Trad-MCN has a significant correlation with traffic variables and chemical elements related to road dust and tailpipe emissions deposited in tree barks. Negative associations between Trad-MCN and both the distance through traffic and the presence of vertical obstacles were observed in the community gardens. The Mn/Zn concentrations in tree barks were associated with increased Trad-MCN",biomonitoring;chemical elements;community gardens;genotoxicity;micronucleus;tree barks;urban environmental,air pollution;chemical elements;commerce;energy dispersive spectroscopy;forestry;health risks;indicators (chemical);pollution control;x ray spectrometers;biomonitoring;community gardens;genotoxicities;micronucleus;tree barks;urban environmental;urban growth;biological marker;atmospheric pollution;bioaccumulation;biomonitoring;concentration (composition);genotoxicity;risk factor;urban area;air pollutant;air pollution;article;bark;bioaccumulation;biological monitoring;carbon footprint;chemical analysis;chemical composition;chemical reaction;community garden;concentration (parameters);controlled study;correlation analysis;dust;environmental exposure;environmental impact;frequency analysis;genotoxicity;geographic distribution;inflorescence;land use;micronucleus;nonhuman;priority journal;rose;sao paulo (state);tetrad test;tradescantia pallida;traffic;urban area;x ray fluorescence;city;drug effect;environmental monitoring;genetics;human;micronucleus test;tradescantia;brazil;sao paulo [brazil];sao paulo [sao paulo (stt)];tradescantia pallida;air pollutants;air pollution;cities;environmental monitoring;gardens;humans;micronucleus tests;tradescantia,"Amato-Lourenco, L.F.; Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, University of Sao Paulo – Sao PauloBrazil; email: luisfamato@usp.br",,Elsevier B.V.,00489697,,STEVA,27720253.0,English,Sci Total Environ,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85002168783,8,Brazil,Brazil,department of pathology;institute of advanced studies;nuclear and energy research institute,department of pathology,accumulation;air;air pollution;area pose;areas;associations;bark sample;barks;benefits;biomarker;biomonitoring;boom;boom hereafter;chemical;chemical element;city;community;community garden;concentrations;control;control site;correlation;cv;deleterious effect;different tree;dispersive;dispersive xray;distance;dust;effects;elemental;elemental concentration;elements;emissions;energy;energy dispersive;factors;fluorescence;fluorescence spectrometer;food;frequencies;frequency;garden;gardening;gardens;genotoxic;genotoxic response;global phenomenon;health;hereafter;human;human health;hunt;identification;impact;indicator;inflorescences;longterm;longterm biomarker;mature;mature plant;methods;micronuclei;micronuclei frequency;mnzn;mnzn concentration;months;negative association;obstacles;pallida;paulo;paulo city;phenomenon;plants;pollution;pose question;poses;positive impact;presence;questions;random;random set;response;result;risk;risk factor;road;road dust;safety;samples;sao;sao paulo;set;shortterm;shortterm indicator;significant correlation;site;slide;slides;society;spectrometer;tailpipe;tailpipe emission;ten;tetrads;tradescantia;tradescantia pallida;tradmcn;traffic;traffic variable;trafficrelated chemical;tree;tree bark;trees;urban garden;urban gardening;use;variables;vegetables;vertical obstacle;xray;xray fluorescence;“purpurea”;“purpurea” boom,accumulation;air;air pollution;biomonitoring;community;community urban;effects;elemental;elemental accumulation;gardens;genotoxic;genotoxic effect;pollution;urban garden,338

This article seeks to emphasize the importance of the agri-urban system concept to analyze the complexity of city-agriculture interactions. Taking the case study of a West African city, its objective is to develop an interpretative framework of these interactions at the territorial level of a city and its region. We propose a systems approach based on the intersection of three groups of interactions: i) spatial and historical interactions between nature, agriculture and the city, ii) interactions between the current urban system and urban agriculture, and iii) interactions within the agricultural system. The aim is to identify how a variety of relationships between city and agriculture are developed and what is at stake for the durability of urban agriculture. Firstly, we show the historical contribution of agriculture to the development of the city: farmers have mobilized local resources to develop a diversity of urban or peri-urban farming activities. Secondly, analyzing the agri-urban system reveals specific forms of urban governance and the weight of informality in the development of urban agriculture.

Technological advances in machine vision, global positioning systems, laser technologies, actuators, and mechatronics have enabled the development and implementation of robotic systems and intelligent technologies for precision agriculture. Herein, we present and review robotic applications on plant pathology and management, and emerging agricultural technologies for intra-urban agriculture. Greenhouse advanced management systems and technologies have been greatly developed in the last years, integrating IoT and WSN (Wireless Sensor Network). Machine learning, machine vision, and AI (Artificial Intelligence) have been utilized and applied in agriculture for automated and robotic farming. Intelligence technologies, using machine vision/learning, have been developed not only for planting, irrigation, weeding (to some extent), pruning, and harvesting, but also for plant disease detection and identification. However, plant disease detection still represents an intriguing challenge, for both abiotic and biotic stress. Many recognition methods and technologies for identifying plant disease symptoms have been successfully developed; still, the majority of them require a controlled environment for data acquisition to avoid false positives. Machine learning methods (e.g., deep and transfer learning) present promising results for improving image processing and plant symptom identification.

What are communities doing to address this problem, and what should they be doing? Good Food, Strong Communities shares ideas and stories about efforts to improve food security in large urban areas of the United States by strengthening community food systems. It draws on five years of collaboration between a research team comprised of the University of Wisconsin, Growing Power, and the Michael Fields Agricultural Institute, and more than thirty organizations on the front lines of this work in Boston, Chicago, Detroit, Milwaukee, Minnesota, Los Angeles, Madison, and Cedar Rapids. Here, activists and scholars talk about what’s working and what still needs to be done to ensure that everyone has access to readily available, affordable, appropriate, and acceptable food. The approach begins by laying out the basic principles of food security and food justice in light of the diversity of food system practices and innovations in America’s cities. The contributing authors address land access for urban agriculture, debates over city farming, new possibilities in food processing, and the marketing of healthy food. They put these basic elements-land, production, processing, and marketing-in the context of municipal policy, education, and food justice and sovereignty, particularly for people of color. While the path of a food product from its producer to its consumer may seem straightforward on the surface, the apparent simplicity hides the complex logistical-and value-laden-factors that create and maintain a food system.

Since California's recent drought was the worst in the last 1200 years, supply of these products may decrease and new sources are needed. To understand the efficacy of growing fruits and vegetables more locally, the energy, water and nutrient impacts of growing fruits and vegetables in local hydroponic and aquaponic controlled environment agriculture systems are compared to vegetables grown in California and shipped to Atlanta, GA. Hydroponically and aquaponically grown fruits and vegetables have areal productivities 29 and 10 times higher than CA-grown vegetables while hydroponically grown vegetables consume 30 times more energy than the CA-grown vegetables. There appears to be no difference in energy consumption between aquaponically- and CA-grown vegetables. On average, 66 and 8 times more water is used in CA-grown vegetables compared to the hydroponic and aquaponic growing techniques. Approximately double the nitrogen needed by plants is applied to CA-grown fruits and vegetables which suggests nitrogen is lost in runoff causing eutrophication downstream.

This results in issues on sustainable food provision in urban areas. Transporting vegetables and fruits from the countryside to the city while keeping them fresh consumes energy and causes loss. Given the cost, growing food in and around cities has never been a new thing. However, only recently, growing food on rooftops on a business scale to achieve self-reliance has increasingly gained attention. With current technological advances in horticulture and agriculture, it has become more likely to secure food provision by cultivating on urban rooftops. Only a few business scale cases reported in high-income societies with a high-density population or experiencing snowing winter can afford and justify the choice of such a high input as well as a high-yield cultivating system. In Taiwan, with a warm winter, it may be more feasible to apply this system because less energy input is required to achieve the same yield as compared to that required in places in temperate climates. By estimating the potential of a high-density city to achieve self-reliance through rooftop growing systems, decision-makers can have more insight into how the idea can be promoted. As of end 2016, Chiayi city has the second largest population density after the capital city. Thus, this research aims at assessing the potential to achieve self-reliance by grow-ing food on rooftops in Chiayi. It analyzes the yields of four types of rooftop cultivating systems and estimates the production and consumption by using these systems on three types of rooftops in different land uses, namely commercial, educational and residential. The result shows that the best scenario for achieving self-reliance is the rooftop hydroponic greenhouse model operating at the commercial scale although this is not sustainable or practical for general households in Chiayi City",food security;roof garden;rooftop farms;scenario analysis;self-reliance;urban agriculture;urban farming;urban food system,agriculture;decision making;food supply;land use;population statistics;food security;food system;roof-garden;scenario analysis;self-reliance;urban agricultures;urban farming;cultivation,,,WITPress,17557437,,,,English,Int J Des Nat ecodyn,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85041750135,3,Taiwan,Taiwan,department of horticultural science,department of horticultural science,achieve;advances;afford;agriculture;aims;analyzes;areas;attention;become;business;business scale;capital;capital city;cases;cause loss;causes;chiayi;chiayi city;choice;chosen;cities;city;climates;commercial scale;consumes;consumption;cost;countryside;decisionmakers;density;different land;end;energy;energy input;estimates;food;food provision;fresh consumes;fruits;general household;global population;greenhouse;greenhouse model;half;high input;highdensity;highdensity city;highdensity population;highincome;highincome society;highyield;horticulture;households;hydroponic;hydroponic greenhouse;idea;input;insight;issues;justify;land;le energy;loss;model;new thing;operating;places;population;population density;production;provision;research;research aim;result;result show;results;rooftop;rooftop cultivating;rooftop hydroponic;rooftops;rural area;scale;scale case;scenario;secure;secure food;selfreliance;shows;societies;sustainable food;system;systems;taiwan;technological advance;temperate;temperate climate;thing;types;urban area;urban rooftop;uses;vegetables;warm;warm winter;winter;yield;yields,chiayi;chiayi city;city;gardening;rooftop;rooftop gardening;selfreliance;taiwan,343

An assessment was done to determine the microbiological quality of irrigation water and lettuce harvested from 10 urban farming sites of Addis Ababa. The efficacy of 5 lettuce washing methods were also assessed. A total of 210 lettuce and 90 irrigation water samples were analyzed for faecal coliform and helminth eggs population levels. Results: The mean faecal coliform levels of irrigation water ranged from 4.29-5.61 log10 MPN 100 ml−1, while on lettuce, the concentrations ranged from 3.46-5.03 log10 MPN 100 g−1. Helminth eggs and larvae were detected in 80% of irrigation water and 61% of lettuce samples. Numbers ranged from 0.9-3.1 eggs 1000 ml−1 and 0.8-3.7 eggs 100 g−1 wet weight for irrigation water and lettuce, respectively. The helminth eggs identified included those of Ascaris lumbricoides, Hookworm, Enterobius vermicularis, Trichuris trichiura, Taenia and Strongloyides larvae. Ascaris lumbricoides and Hookworm were most prevalent in both irrigation water and lettuce samples. Compared with the WHO recommendations and international standards, the faecal coliform and helminth eggs levels in irrigation water and lettuce samples exceeded the recommended levels. Irrespective of the tested washing methods, faecal coliform and helminth eggs levels were somehow reduced. Among the washing methods, potable tap water washing-rinsing (2 min) followed by dipping in 15 000 ppm vinegar solution for a minute supported the highest faecal coliorm reduction of 1.7 log10 units, whereas lowest reduction of 0.8 log10 units was achieved for the same procedure without vinegar. Conclusion: Compared with international standards, both faecal coliform and helminth eggs levels exceeded recommended thresholds in water and lettuce, but still in a potential risk range which can be easily mitigated if farmers and households are aware of the potential risk. Aside preventing occupational exposure, potential risk reduction programs should target households which have so far no guidance on how best to wash vegetables. The result of the present study suggest that the vinegar based washing methods are able to reduce faecal coliform towards low level while the physical washing with running water may help to substantially decrease potential risk of helminth parasitic infections",addis ababa;faecal coliform;helminth eggs;lettuce;mitigation;potential risk;washing;wastewater;who,,"Woldetsadik, D.; School of Natural Resources Management and Environmental Sciences, Haramaya University, 138, Ethiopia; email: destowol@yahoo.com",,BioMed Central Ltd.,21962804,,,,English,Int J Food Contam,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85049341929,6,Sri Lanka;Ethiopia;Kenya;Namibia,Ethiopia,school of natural resources management and environmental sciences;international water management institute;eastern and southern africa regional office;department of crop science;aklilu lemma institute of pathobiology,school of natural resources management and environmental sciences,ababa;addis;addis ababa;akaki;akaki river;ascaris;ascaris lumbricoides;assessment;background;coliform;coliform level;coliform towards;coliorm;coliorm reduction;concentrations;conclusion;contamination;decrease;decrease potential;determine;efficacy;egg;egg g−1;egg level;egg ml−1;egg population;eggs;enterobius;enterobius vermicularis;exposure;faecal coliform;faecal coliorm;farmers;guidance;g−1;g−1 wet;helminth;helminth egg;help;hookworm;households;infections;information;international standard;irrigation;irrigation water;larvae;lettuce;lettuce sample;level;levels;log10;log10 mpn;log10 unit;low level;lumbricoides;mean;methods;microbial;microbial contamination;microbiological quality;min;minute;ml−1;mpn;mpn g−1;mpn ml−1;numbers;occupational exposure;parasitic infection;physical washing;population;population level;potable tap;potential risk;ppm;ppm vinegar;present;present study;prevalent;procedure;production;programs;quality;range;recommendations;reduction;reduction program;result;results;risk;risk range;risk reduction;river;samples;scanty;sites;solution;somehow;standards;strongloyides;study;suggest;taenia;tap;tap water;target;target household;thresholds;towards;trichiura;trichuris;trichuris trichiura;units;urban farming;vegetable;vegetable production;vegetables;vermicularis;vinegar;vinegar solution;wash;wash vegetable;water;water sample;weight;wet;wet weight;whereas,ababa;addis;addis ababa;effect;ethiopia;green salad;lactuca;lactuca sativa;lettuce;lettuce lactuca;methods;microbiological quality;quality;salads;sativa;wastewater,344

Manifold city-adjusted farm activities belong to these business models resulting in the characteristic farm heterogeneity of urban areas. This paper makes use of the business models as tool for a geo-statistical analysis to spatially investigate farming patterns in reference region Metropolis Ruhr, Germany. Additional farm interviews substantiate findings of the geo-statistical analysis by focusing on horticulture as a common farm activity towards ‘low-cost specialization’, direct marketing and participatory farming belonging to ‘differentiation’, and equestrian services as a representative of the ‘diversification’ business model. These farm activities and underlying business models concentrate and tend to spatially cluster in the metropolitan's center where population density is highest and farmland proportion is lowest. Agriculture plays a significant role in Metropolis Ruhr cultivating about one-third of the metropolitan area, but on-going loss of farmland and short-term lease of land affect farms considerably by complicating access to land. Most differentiated and diversified farms require certain amount of farmland to be successful, which is threatened by further farmland losses along with increased competition for the remaining farmland. Long-term planning security is crucial for farms focusing on high added value crops and organic farming. Progressively emerging participatory farming activities demonstrate urban farms’ abilities to innovatively adapt to societal demands. Better knowledge on professional urban agriculture's farm activities and business models is of importance for farms and their related advisory services to address the urban context in farm development strategies more accurately, but also for public authorities’ planning and policies in land-related decision making.

This article examines the geographical implications of Cuba’s low-carbon urban farming based on fieldwork in five organoponicos in Pinar del Rio. The article charts how energy flows, biophysical relations, and socially mediated ecological processes are spatially organised to enable large-scale urban agricultural production. To explain this production system, the literature on Cuban agroecology postulates a model of two distinct modes: agroecology versus industrial agriculture. Yet this distinction inadequately explains Cuba’s urban agriculture: production in the organoponicos rather sits across categories, at once involving agroecological, organic-industrial, and petro-industrial features. To resolve this contradiction, a more nuanced framework is developed that conceptualises production systems by means of their geographical configuration.

One of the key measures to achieve such reductions as a way to mitigate and adapt to climate change is to increase food and energy self-sufficiency in residential areas. The objective of this study is to explore the potential self-sufficiency in terms of food and energy in generic residential districts in Singapore and Southeast Asia. Computational tools are employed to obtain quantifiable indicators based on sunlight availability. A series of building typologies and urban forms was created as abstractions from actual residential developments in Singapore (1.3°N). In total, 57 cases were assessed in terms of sunlight availability and the impact of three density and geometry parameters: plot ratio, site coverage and building height were considered. Results from selected cases were compared to Hanoi's conditions (21°N). The results show that the indicators having the higher impact on the food and energy self-sufficiency are plot ratio and building height. The cases with the lowest plot ratio (PR < 1.9) achieved food self-sufficiency when a hybrid higher-yield farming method was applied. Regarding energy harvesting, the cases with the lowest building height (<42 m) achieve energy self-sufficiency due to the maximum exposed area with PV per number of residents. In low-latitude regions, solar access is more evenly distributed among all facade orientations than in higher latitudes, therefore providing all facade orientations with food and energy harvesting potential. Food and energy self-sufficiency in equatorial regions is more heavily influenced by the available farming and PV area in relation to the total population than by the reduction of sunlight availability due to building typology and morphology",bipv;low-carbon neighbourhoods;solar access;urban farming;urban resilience,climate change;energy harvesting;gas emissions;greenhouse gases;bipv;low carbon;solar access;urban farmings;urban resilience;housing;carbon emission;ecological footprint;energy resource;environmental indicator;environmental management;farming system;food availability;greenhouse gas;neighborhood;photovoltaic system;residential location;self sufficiency;solar radiation;urban planning;urban population;hanoi;singapore [southeast asia];viet nam,"Tablada, A.; Department of Architecture, School of Design and Environment, National University of Singapore, 4 Architecture Drive, Singapore; email: abel@nus.edu.sg",,Elsevier Ltd,0038092X,,SRENA,,English,Sol Energy,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84995642096,2,Singapore,Singapore,department of architecture,department of architecture,abstractions;access;achieve;actual residential;adapt;area;areas;asia;availability;available farming;building;building height;building typology;carbon;case;cases;change;climate;climate change;computational;computational tool;conditions;coverage;density;developments;districts;ecological footprint;economy;emissions;energy;energy harvesting;energy selfsufficiency;equatorial region;explore;facade;facade orientation;food;food selfsufficiency;footprint;forms;gas;gas ghg;generic;generic residential;geometry;geometry parameter;ghg;ghg emission;greenhouse;greenhouse gas;hanoi condition;hanois;height;higheryield;higheryield farming;housing;hybrid;hybrid higheryield;impact;increase;increase food;indicators;key;key measure;latitudes;lowlatitude;lowlatitude region;maximum;measures;method;mitigate;morphology;neutral economy;new housing;number;objective;orientations;parameter plot;parameters;plot;plot ratio;population;population worldwide;potential selfsufficiency;pr;pv;pv area;quantifiable indicator;ratio;ratio pr;reduction;reductions;regions;relation;residential area;residential development;residential district;residents;result show;results;selfsufficiency;series;show;singapore;site;site coverage;solar;solar access;southeast;southeast asia;study;sunlight;sunlight availability;terms;tools;total population;transition;typologies;typology;urban form;urban population;way;worldwide,availability;districts;energy;energy selfsufficiency;food;generic;generic residential;potential food;residential district;selfsufficiency;sunlight;sunlight availability;tropical generic,350

However, edible urban crops may be contaminated by airborne pollutants, thus leading to serious health risks. Therefore, a better understanding of contamination risks of urban cultivation is needed in order to define safe practices. In particular, whereas it is commonly accepted that the contamination of urban-grown food comes from airborne pollutants, little is known on a possible contamination by soils. Here, we studied trace metal risk in horticultural crops grown in an experimental urban allotment garden in Bologna, Italy. Seven experiments were conducted between June and November 2015 on tomato, sweet basil, onion, lettuce, kale, bulb fennel and radish. Treatments included two growing systems, soil and soilless, and two fertilization managements, mineral and organic. Trace metal concentrations were measured in soils, substrates and edible plant tissues. We identified preferentially translocated metals by partitioning analysis of tomato, sweet basil and kale. Results showed that crops grown in a soilless system have a lower metal content of −70 % for Cr, −61 % for Cu, −45 % for Cd and −81 % for Ni, compared with those grown in soil.

In Oslo, the capital of Norway, one must wait 10–20 years to get a plot in one of the urban AGs. Being an urban gardener can have a number of health benefits. However, the literature in this field has primarily studied community gardens in which it is not possible to stay overnight. An AG in Oslo is a plot of about 200 m2 with a small cottage one can live in during the summer season. In the present study, we explore individual plot holders’ reasons for engaging in one of the AGs in Oslo. Thirty-three plot holders were interviewed. The topics discussed concerned their reasons for and the perceived benefits of being plot holders. The findings show that the reasons for engaging in urban gardening are mainly related to a desire for a safe play environment for the children, a place to cultivate, and direct contact with the outdoors. The benefits of having a plot were related to having meaningful activities, being part of a social network and having a respite from ‘normal’ life in one’s apartment. The present findings are unique in that they show that being a plot holder in an AG in Oslo involves much more than having a leisure activity or a place to cultivate. It has health benefits, both physical and psychological. It is a way of living and makes life in the city liveable.

In recent years, URF has been experiencing increasing popularity. It is a practice that is well-suited to enhancing food security in cities and reducing the environmental impact that results from long transportation distances that are common in conventional agriculture. To date, most URF initiatives have been motivated by social and educational factors rather than the aim of creating large sustainable food production systems in cities. The commercial operation of urban rooftop farms, should they become profitable, is likely to attract notable private investment, allowing a significant level of high quality urban food production to be achieved. There is a reasonable amount of literature available on urban farming that deals with its potential, and its limitations. However, it does not focus on commercial operations. In contrast to other surveys and theoretical papers, this study of URF focuses on large and commercial operations. The analysis showed that commercial URFs can be grouped into two main types: Firstly, hydroponic systems in greenhouses where mostly leafy greens, tomatoes, and herbs are grown; secondly, soil-based open-air farms that grow a large variety of vegetables. Hydroponics is frequently seen as the key technology for commercial urban food production. While the technology is not in and of itself sustainable, hydroponic farms often make an effort to implement environmentally friendly technologies and methods. However, there is still untapped potential to systemically integrate farms into buildings.

In rapidly growing urban settings, little is known about the extent of intestinal parasite infections. We assessed the point-prevalence and risk factors of intestinal parasite infections in population groups differently exposed to wastewater in urban and peri-urban transition zones in Hanoi, the capital of Vietnam. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was carried out between April and June 2014 in people aged ≥ 18 years at risk of wastewater exposure from To Lich River: workers maintaining wastewater treatment facilities; urban farmers reusing wastewater; and urban dwellers at risk of flooding events. For comparison, two peri-urban population groups living in close proximity to the Red River were chosen: farmers using river water for irrigation purposes; and people living in the same communities. A single stool sample was subjected to Kato-Katz and formalin-ether concentration methods for the diagnosis of helminth and intestinal protozoa infections. A questionnaire was administered to determine risk factors and self-reported signs and symptoms. Results: A total of 681 individuals had complete data records. Highest point-prevalence rates of intestinal parasite infections were observed for peri-urban farmers (30 %). Hookworm and Trichuris trichiura were the predominant helminth species (25 % and 5 %, respectively). Peri-urban farmers were at higher odds of infection with intestinal parasites than any other groups (adjusted odds ratio 5.8, 95 % confidence interval 2.5 to 13.7). Lack of access to improved sanitation and not receiving deworming within the past 12 months were associated with higher infection risk, while higher educational attainment and socioeconomic status were negatively associated with intestinal parasite infections. Conclusions: Our results suggest that exposure to wastewater was not directly associated with infection with helminths and intestinal protozoa in different population groups in Hanoi. These findings might be explained by a high level of awareness of health risks and access to safe sanitary infrastructure in urban areas.

Much of this lead remains near the surface where it has the potential to impact human health. Exposure to lead, especially in children, can have lasting impacts on neurological development and academic achievement. Urban gardening, in particular, is an activity that could result in increased exposure to soil lead for many unsuspecting gardeners. During the summer of 2012, more than 1,061 surface soil samples were collected from an approximately 1.25 acre urban community garden in Terre Haute, Indiana. Samples were collected to evaluate the spatial distribution of lead across the community garden on the plot level. The results highlight the variability that can be seen within small areas of a former residential property, for example lead concentrations that are low (<200 parts per million [ppm]) within the same 10 x 10 foot garden plot as concentrations that are considered high (>600 ppm).

For example, in Hanoi, it creates important livelihood opportunities for &gt; 500,000 farmers in peri-urban communities. Discharge of domestic effluents pollute the water streams with potential pathogenic organisms posing a public health threat to farmers and consumers of wastewater-fed foodstuff. We determined the effectiveness of Hanoi's wastewater conveyance system, placing particular emphasis on the quality of wastewater used in agriculture and aquaculture. Between April and June 2014, a total of 216 water samples were obtained from 24 sampling points and the concentrations of total coliforms (TC), Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp. and helminth eggs determined. Despite applied wastewater treatment, agricultural field irrigation water was heavily contaminated with TC (1.3 × 107 colony forming unit (CFU)/100 mL), E. coli (1.1 × 106 CFU/100 mL) and Salmonella spp. (108 most probable number (MPN)/100 mL). These values are 110-fold above Vietnamese discharge limits for restricted agriculture and 260-fold above the World Health Organization (WHO)'s tolerable safety limits for unrestricted agriculture. Mean helminth egg concentrations were below WHO tolerable levels in all study systems (&lt; 1 egg/L). Hence, elevated levels of bacterial contamination, but not helminth infections, pose a major health risk for farmers and consumers of wastewater fed-products. We propose a set of control measures that might protect the health of exposed population groups without compromising current urban farming activities.

For the most part it is the poor and women who, working on small farms located both inside and outside the city, are nurturing this politico-cultural movement. Their agricultural settings are creating new and interesting landscapes that need to be analyzed from an aesthetic perspective as well for the influence that they might have on contemporary landscape architecture.

Scholars and public commentators often draw on Marxian theories of alienation to suggest that manual work constitutes a key strategy for reconnecting production and consumption, and overcoming the ecological rift between natural processes and modern, agro-industrial production. Focusing on urban farming, this article complicates the picture of unalienated, decommodified labor and points to continuous negotiations between experiences of re-embedding in the community and the environment, and the on-going commodification of the farming experience. We argue that urban farms function as sites of “experiential production” where farm managers stage work experiences for the volunteers and where visitors build new socialities, reconnect to nature, and accrue social and cultural capital in the context of a global economy that offers limited work opportunities for a generation of highly educated college graduates. Relying on ethnographic fieldwork and 40 semi-structured interviews with employed urban farmers and regular volunteers in metropolitan areas of the Northeastern United States as well as the examination of online and print materials, our analysis highlights the contradictory ways in which manual work in alternative food networks indeed counters alienation, while also reproducing consumer society institutions and reinforcing the core values defining neoliberalism such as productivity and self-improvement",alternative food networks;distance;labor;manual work;urban farming,farming system;food consumption;food production;global economy;labor;metropolitan area;urban agriculture;united states,"Mincyte, D.; Department of Social Science, New York City College of Technology, The City University of New York, 300 Jay Street, Namm 611, United States; email: dmincyte@citytech.cuny.edu",,SAGE Publications Ltd,0308518X,,,,English,Environ Plann A,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84981240581,2,Austria;United States,United States,department of social science;department of marketing & sales;institute for ecological economics,department of social science,accrue;agroindustrial production;alienation;alternative;alternative food;analysis;analysis highlight;areas;argue;article;article complicates;article examines;bridging;build;capital;college;college graduate;commentators;commodification;community;complicates;constitutes;consumer;consumer society;consumption;context;continuous negotiation;contradictory;contradictory way;core;core value;counter alienation;counters;cultural capital;distance;draw;ecological rift;economy;environment;ethnographic fieldwork;examination;examines;experience;experiences;farm;farm function;farm manager;farmers;farms;fieldwork;food;food network;function;generation;global economy;graduates;highlights;institutions;interviews;key;key strategy;labor;limited work;manager stage;managers;manual work;marxian;marxian theory;materials;metropolitan;metropolitan area;natural process;nature;negotiations;neoliberalism;networks;new sociality;offers;online;opportunities;picture;points;print;print material;processes;production;production”;productivity;public;public commentator;reconnect;regular volunteer;rift;role;scholars;selfimprovement;sites;socialities;society;society institution;stage;stage work;states;strategy;suggest;theories;united state;urban farm;urban farmer;urban farming;values;visitor build;visitors;volunteers;ways;work;work constitutes;work experience;work opportunity;“experiential production”,alternative;alternative food;american metropolis;distance;food;food network;metropolis;networks;north;urban farming;work,360

Unlike the garden suburbs of North America or Europe, Dar es Salaam's suburban residents often engage in multiple income-generating activities, the most common and conspicuous of which are cultivation and animal husbandry. The presence of urban farming has suggested that Dar es Salaam's residents represent peasants incrementally transitioning to urban life. This article however, contends that everything from the varieties of cultivation, access to land and water, to the definition of what it means to be a farmer is shaped by decentralised private interests controlling access to land and resources in suburban neighbourhoods. The varieties of cultivation and animal husbandry instead reflect socioeconomic class distinctions emerging from a new suburban political economy, enabling a clearer perspective on the prospects of cultivators as these suburban districts transform",,class;cultivation;decentralization;income;neighborhood;resource use;socioeconomic status;suburban area;urban development;urban growth;dar es salaam [tanzania];europe;north america;tanzania;animalia,"Owens, G.R.; Department of Sociology and Anthropology, Wright State University, 3640 Colonel Glenn Highway, United States; email: geoffrey.owens@wright.edu",,Cambridge University Press,0022278X,,,,English,J Mod Afr Stud,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84982908664,1,United States,United States,department of sociology and anthropology,department of sociology and anthropology,access;activities;america;animal;animal husbandry;article;citizens;class;class distinction;clearer;clearer perspective;contends;cultivation;cultivators;dar;dar e;definition;development;distinctions;district transform;districts;e salaam;economy;engage;es;europe;everything;exurban;exurban growth;farmer;garden;garden suburb;growth;husbandry;incomegenerating activity;interests;land;life;majority;means;multiple;multiple incomegenerating;neighbourhoods;new suburban;north;north america;peasants;perspective;political economy;presence;private interest;prospects;reflect;reflect socioeconomic;represent;represent peasant;resident represent;residents;resources;salaam;salaam resident;salaam suburban;salaams;socioeconomic class;suburban;suburban district;suburban neighbourhood;suburban resident;suburbs;tanzania;today;transform;urban farming;urban life;urbanites;varieties;water;world,contemporary dar;cultivators;dar;dar e;dilemmas;e salaam;es;farmer dilemma;farmers;prospects;residential suburban;salaam;suburban;suburban cultivator;tanzania,361

In China, for example, densely packed mega cities will continue to expand in number and size, necessitating increasing food miles. Interestingly, it has been estimated that the total rooftop space in China is about 1 million hectares, some of which can be converted for rooftop farming. Yet, despite some favorable reports on urban farming, the Chinese commercial sector has shown little interest. This may be explained by the dearth of data comparing urban and conventional farming. Therefore, we present here a feasibility study of hydroponically grown vegetables in a rooftop screen house in Guangzhou, China. From December, 2012 to May, 2014, we tested the production of seven leafy vegetables that are easily perishable and are not well suited to long-distance transport. We calculated the production cost and measured biochemical parameters. Results show that levels of vitamin C, potassium, calcium, magnesium, iron, zinc, and crude fiber were comparable to market counterparts. None of the roof hydroponic vegetables exceeded the maximum residue limit for lead, arsenic, cadmium, chromium, mercury, or nitrate. In contrast, 5 of 98 market vegetables were contaminated by exceeding the maximum residue limit for lead.

Urban farming (keeping chickens, vegetable gardening) requires soil disturbance and can increase exposure of residents to these contaminants. We measured the level of lead, arsenic, cadmium, copper and zinc contaminants in soil and eggs from 26 backyard chicken coops across the Lower Hunter, NSW Australia. We compared the levels of metals in soil to Health Investigation Levels and metals in home-grown eggs to the levels in commercial eggs tested in this study or published by Food Standards Australia New Zealand. The levels of arsenic, cadmium, copper and zinc were low, both in soil and in home-grown eggs and were comparable to commercial eggs tested in this study. The Health Investigation Level for lead in soil (300 mg lead/kg soil) was exceeded at 7 of the 26 sites. The level of lead in home-grown eggs was generally higher than in commercial eggs. The reference health standard for meat (including chicken), fruit and vegetables of 0.1 mg lead/kg produce was exceeded in home-grown eggs from 7 of the 26 sites. There was a significant relationship between the lead level in eggs and the lead level in soil accessible to chickens. As soil lead increased, concentrations of lead in eggs tended to increase.

A critical aspect, which decides the sustainability of plant growth is the quality of soil. All other things being fixed, the quality of soil greatly impacts the plant stress, which in turn impacts overall health. Although plant stress manifests in many ways, one of the clearest indicators are colors of the leaves. In this paper, we conducted an experimental study in a greenhouse for detecting plant stress caused by nutrient deficiencies in soil using smart-phone cameras, coupled with image processing and machine learning algorithms. The greenhouse experiment was conducted by growing two plant species; willows (Salix Pentandra) and poplars (Populus deltoides x nigra, DN34), in two treatments. These treatments included: unamended tailings (collected from a lead mine tailings pond and characterized by nutrient deficiency), and biosolids amended tailings. Biosolids are very rich in nutrients and were added to the tailings in one of the two treatments to supply plants with nutrients. Subsequently, we captured various images of plant leaves grown in both soils. Each image taken was pre-processed via filtration to remove associated noise, and was segmented into pixels to facilitate scalability of analysis. Subsequently, we designed random forests based algorithms to detect the stress of leaves as indicated by their coloring. In a dataset consisting of 34 leaves, our technique yields classifications with a high degree of prediction, recall and F1 score. Our work in this paper, while restricted to two types of plants and soils, can be generalized. We see applications in the emerging area of urban farming in terms of empowering citizens with tools and technologies for enhancing quality of farming practices",image processing;machine learning algorithms;participatory sensing;plant stress;smart-phones,artificial intelligence;biological materials;biosolids;cameras;classification (of information);cotton;decision trees;greenhouses;image processing;learning algorithms;learning systems;nutrients;smartphones;soils;tailings;telephone sets;farming practices;greenhouse experiments;nutrient deficiency;participatory sensing;plant stress;populus deltoides;smart-phone cameras;tools and technologies;plants (botany),,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9781509017430,,,English,"Int Conf Sel Top Mob Wirel Netw, MoWNeT",Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84981342162,5,United States,United States,department of computer science and engineering;department of civil,department of computer science and engineering,algorithms;analysis;applications;area;aspect;biosolids;cameras;citizens;classifications;clearest;clearest indicator;colors;critical aspect;dataset;decides;deficiencies;deficiency;degree;deltoides;detect;detecting plant;dn34;existence;experiment;experimental;experimental study;f1;f1 score;facilitate;facilitate scalability;farming practice;filtration;forests;greenhouse;greenhouse experiment;grown;growth;health;high degree;image;image processing;images;impacts;indicators;lead;lead mine;leaf;leaf grown;leaves;life;machine;machine learning;manifests;many way;mine;mine tailing;nigra;noise;nutrient;nutrient deficiency;nutrients;overall health;paper;pentandra;pixels;planet;plant;plant growth;plant leaf;plant specie;plant stress;plants;pond;poplar populus;poplars;populus;populus deltoides;practices;prediction;processing;quality;random;recall;salix;salix pentandra;scalability;score;smartphone;smartphone camera;soil;soils;species;stress;study;supply;supply plant;sustainability;tailings;technique;technique yield;technologies;terms;things;tools;treatments;turn;turn impact;types;unamended tailing;urban farming;various image;vital;ways;willow salix;willows;work;x;x nigra;yield classification;yields,cameras;effectiveness;plant;plant stress;smartphone;smartphone camera;soil;soil treatment;stress;treatment,365

Our results indicate that urban gardening can contribute to perceived attractiveness of urban areas, but that not all approaches are perceived as equally positive. While flowerbeds or flower meadows and orderly-managed vegetable plots, in comparison to conventional lawns, increased the aesthetic appeal of urban green space, container gardening approaches, which were often characterized as chaotic, did not. Although flower scenarios were preferred over vegetable scenarios, participants were rather positive about the idea of having more vegetable plots around. Socio-demographic variables had only minor influences on preferences and attitudes. As people were fonder of flowerbeds or flower meadows than of vegetable plots, a mixture of both might be advisable in urban gardening sites.

The work is aimed at suggesting that, while often associated in geography and planning literature with urban informality practices (e.g. accidental city or self-made urbanism), urban gardening actually presents the character of a distinctive form of people's interaction with urban space, here defined as “informal planning”. This includes practices that are intentionally put forward by local dwellers with the intention of urban space planning and organizing public life in the absence of legal definition, guidance and funds provided by public authorities or the private sector. Urban gardening cases in Rome exemplify the emergence of informal planning and show how, by questioning the counterplanning tradition that understands urban gardening as an antagonist spatial practice opposing institutional planning, informal planning can open up collaborative possibilities. A new mode of interaction between citizens' agency and the formal planning initiatives of local administration can lead to creative solutions to address some of the problems associated with the neoliberal transformation of the city space, most notably the decrease in public space and its deterioration",counterplanning;informal planning;rome;urban gardening;urban informality,garden city;open space;public space;urban planning;italy;lazio;roma [lazio];rome,"Certoma, C.; Research Fellow Sant'Anna School of Advanced Studies, Piazza Martiri della Liberta' 33, Italy; email: chiara.certoma@sssup.it",,Blackwell Publishing Ltd,04353684,,,,English,Geogr Ann Ser B Hum Geogr,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84996671004,1,Italy,Italy,research fellow sant'anna school of advanced studies,research fellow sant'anna school of advanced studies,absence;accidental;accidental city;address;administration;agency;antagonist;antagonist spatial;article;article investigates;authorities;building;cases;character;citizen agency;citizens;city;city space;collaborative;collaborative possibility;creative solution;decrease;definition;deterioration;distinctive;distinctive form;dwellers;e;emergence;field;field research;form;formal planning;funds;g;gardening;gardening case;gardening initiative;geography;guidance;informal planning;informality;informality practice;initiatives;institutional planning;intention;interaction;investigates;italy;lead;legal definition;life;literature;local administration;local dweller;mode;neoliberal transformation;new mode;peoples;planning;planning literature;planning”;possibilities;practice;practice e;practices;presents;private sector;problems;public;public authority;public life;public space;put;relationship;research;results;rome;rome exemplify;sector;selfmade;selfmade urbanism;show;solutions;space;space planning;spatial practice;tradition;transformation;understands;urban gardening;urban informality;urban space;urbanism;work;“informal planning”,gardening;informal planning;new season;planning;planning’;rome;season;urban gardening;‘a,367

Because such areas do not always have good access to nutritionally adequate food, the question of how to supply them is an urgent priority in order to maintain a healthy population. Urban and peri-urban agriculture, as sources of local fresh food, could play an important role. Whereas some scholars do not differentiate between peri-urban and urban agriculture, seeing them as a single entity, our hypothesis is that they are distinct, and that this has important consequences for food security and other issues. This has knock-on effects for food system planning and has not yet been appropriately analysed. The objectives of this study are to provide a systematic understanding of urban and peri-urban agriculture in the Global North, showing their similarities and differences, and to analyse their impact on urban food security. To this end, an extensive literature review was conducted, resulting in the identification and comparison of their spatial, ecological and socio-economic characteristics. The findings are discussed in terms of their impact on food security in relation to the four levels of the food system: food production, processing, distribution and consumption. The results show that urban and peri-urban agriculture in the Global North indeed differ in most of their characteristics and consequently also in their ability to meet the food needs of urban inhabitants. While urban agriculture still meets food needs mainly at the household level, peri-urban agriculture can provide larger quantities and has broader distribution pathways, giving it a separate status in terms of food security. Nevertheless, both possess (unused) potential, making them valuable for urban food planning, and both face similar threats regarding urbanisation pressures, necessitating adequate planning measures",adaptation strategies;metropolitan agriculture;urban food system;urban fringe;urban gardening,,"Berges, R.; Leibniz Centre for Agricultural Landscape Research (ZALF), Eberswalder Straße 84, Germany; email: berges@zalf.de",,Springer Netherlands,0889048X,,,,English,Agric Hum Values,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84930155340,4,Germany,Germany,leibniz centre for agricultural landscape research (zalf);department of agricultural and food marketing,leibniz centre for agricultural landscape research (zalf),ability;access;adequate;adequate food;adequate planning;agriculture;analyse;areas;broader;characteristics;comparison;consequences;consumption;differ;differences;differentiate;distinct;distribution;distribution pathway;effects;end;entity;extensive literature;face;findings;food;food need;food planning;food production;food security;food system;fresh food;global north;good access;healthy population;household;household level;hypothesis;identification;impact;important consequence;important role;inhabitants;issues;knockon;level;levels;literature;literature review;local fresh;maintain;measures;meet;meet food;meets;needs;north;objectives;order;pathways;periurban;periurban agriculture;planning;planning measure;play;population;possess;pressures;priority;processing;production;provide;quantities;question;relation;relevant;relevant topic;result show;results;review;role;scholars;security;separate status;show;similar threat;similarities;single entity;socioeconomic characteristic;sources;status;study;supply;system;system food;system planning;systematic understanding;terms;threats;topic;unused potential;urban agriculture;urban area;urban food;urban inhabitant;urbanisation;urbanisation pressure;urgent;urgent priority;whereas,agriculture;area difference;areas;differences;food;food security;global north;north;periurban;periurban agriculture;security;urban agriculture;urban area,369

We describe the agroecological and social characteristics of 61 food-producing gardens in New York City, drawing on gardener interviews, land-use maps, plant species inventories, arthropod scouting, and soil sampling and analysis. Gardens contained agricultural crops, food production infrastructure, ornamental plants, and recreational areas in varying proportions, indicating that gardens serve multiple and distinct purposes depending on community needs and interests. On average, gardeners devoted the greatest proportion of garden area (44 %) to food production, and supplied a large share of their households’ produce needs from their community gardens. Solanaceae, Brassicaceae, and Cucurbitaceae crops dominated food crop areas, hindering effective crop rotation to prevent disease and pest problems. Most gardeners grew crops in raised beds constructed with clean fill and compost. These soils generally had sandy textures, low water-holding capacity, high organic matter levels (with a large proportion from recent inputs) and excessive nutrient levels. Soil water content at field capacity increased exponentially with total soil carbon, suggesting that organic matter enhances water-holding capacity. Insect pest densities greatly exceeded action thresholds in nearly all gardens for aphids and whiteflies on Brassica crops, aphids on Cucurbit crops, and two-spotted spider mites on tomatoes. Predator and parasitoid densities were generally low (less than one per plant on average), perhaps partially due to low floral and woody perennial cover in most gardens (12 % and 9 % on average, respectively). Dominant groups of natural enemies were minute pirate bugs, spiders, and parasitoid wasps. A wide variety of people of differing experience levels, incomes, and ethnicities participate in community gardening in NYC, and most gardens host multiple languages. Promising directions for urban gardening research, education, and practice include: 1) Cover cropping to improve soil quality and nutrient management, and diversify crop rotations; 2) Improving access to soil testing and guidance on appropriate use of soil amendments, 3) Enhancing habitat for arthropod natural enemies that provide biological control of insect pests with floral and woody perennial plantings; and 4) Incorporating ecological knowledge and inquiry-based approaches into gardening workshops, educational materials, and technical support, and offering these resources in multiple languages",community gardens;ecological knowledge;ecosystem services;food security;gardening education;insect pest management;land-use;new york city;soil fertility;soil quality;urban agriculture;urban arthropods,,"Gregory, M.M.; Department of Horticulture, Cornell University, 134A Plant Science Building, United States; email: gregormm@forsyth.cc",,Springer New York LLC,10838155,,,,English,Urban Ecosyst,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84949484697,3,United States,United States,department of horticulture;department of biology,department of horticulture,access;action;action threshold;agricultural crop;agricultural production;amendments;america;analysis;aphids;approaches;appropriate;appropriate use;area;areas;arthropod;beds;biological control;brassica;brassica crop;brassicaceae;bugs;capacity;carbon;characteristics;city;clean;clean fill;community;community garden;community gardening;compost;content;control;cover;cover cropping;crop;crop area;crop rotation;crops;cucurbit;cucurbit crop;cucurbitaceae;cucurbitaceae crop;densities;describe;directions;disease;distinct;diversify;dominant;dominant group;ecological knowledge;ecological process;education;educational materials;effective crop;enemies;enhances;ethnicities;ethnicity participate;excessive nutrient;experience;experience level;field;field capacity;fill;food;food crop;food production;garden;garden area;garden host;garden serve;gardener;gardener interview;gardeners;gardening;gardening research;gardening workshop;gardens;groups;guidance;habitat;high organic;host;host multiple;households’;households’ produce;include;include cover;incomes;infrastructure;inputs;inquirybased approach;insect;insect pest;interest;interests;interviews;inventories;knowledge;landuse;landuse maps;languages;large proportion;large share;levels;little research;low floral;low le;low waterholding;management;maps;materials;matter;matter enhances;matter level;minute;minute pirate;mites;multiple;multiple language;natural enemy;needs;new york;north;north america;nutrient;nutrient level;nutrient management;nyc;offering;organic matter;ornamental;ornamental plants;parasitoid;parasitoid density;parasitoid wasp;participation;people;perennial;perennial cover;perennial planting;pest;pest problem;pests;pirate;pirate bug;plant;plant specie;plantings;plants;practice;predator;prevent;prevent disease;problems;processes;produce;production;production infrastructure;promising;promising direction;proportion;proportions;provide;public;public interest;purposes;quality;recent input;recreational area;research;resources;rotation;rotations;sandy;sandy texture;serve;serve multiple;share;social characteristic;soil;soil amendment;soil carbon;soil quality;soil water;soils;solanaceae;spaces;specie inventory;species;spider;spider mite;spiders;support;technical support;textures;thresholds;tomatoes;total soil;urban community;urban gardening;use;variety;wasps;water;water content;whiteflies;wide variety;woody;workshops;york;york city,characteristics;city;city community;community;community garden;contributions;ecosystem;ecosystem services;education;environmental education;food;food security;garden contribution;gardens;new york;security;services;social characteristic;urban food;york;york city,372

Often, farmland is still removed from agricultural reserves for the 'good of society' (for example, creating industrial parks). In 2008, an action research project was initiated to attempt to reduce agricultural vulnerability in several peri-urban and rural areas near Montreal by emphasising the importance of the appropriation of the value of these farmlands by non-farm citizens and actors. The action research roles involved accompanying the farmers, facilitating meetings, mobilising non-farm actors, and informing farmers of possibilities when asked to do so. In this article, one specific project is analysed in Senneville (in the west of Montreal Island). While the project was initiated by the farmers to guarantee their long-term future, they also sought to involve other, mostly non-agricultural, actors. In a colloquium, a collective vision for the project was constructed, integrating other functions of farmland such as conservation and leisure activities. Many meetings were organised over a three-year period and formal presentations were made to the municipality. The project is ongoing, including new farm operations and the reinforcement of local markets for marketing mainly organic produce. The area is now an integral part of an emerging 'green belt' of the Montreal agglomeration and is already part of a 'green coalition' of both urban and peri-urban actors (farmers and non-farmers), and an emerging food system movement which represents a more holistic approach to food production",farmland conservation;farmland multi-functionality;peri-urban agriculture,agricultural land;collective action;food production;future prospect;holistic approach;land use planning;urban planning;canada;montreal;quebec [canada],"Bryant, C.R.; Department of Geography, University of Montreal, CP 6128 Succursale Centre-ville, Canada; email: christopher.robin.bryant@gmail.com",,Blackwell Publishing Ltd,17455863,,,,English,Geogr Res,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84931846789,2,Canada,Canada,department of geography;school of environmental design and rural development,department of geography,action;action research;activities;actor farmer;actors;agglomeration;agricultural land;agricultural reserve;agricultural vulnerability;approach;appropriation;area;areas;article;attempt;belt;canada;citizens;coalition;collective;collective vision;colloquium;conservation;example;facilitating meetings;farm;farm operation;farmers;farmland;farmlands;food;food production;food system;formal presentation;functions;future;green belt;green coalition;guarantee;holistic approach;importance;important pressure;increase;industrial park;initiatives;integral part;involve;island;jurisdictions;land;leisure;leisure activity;local market;longterm;longterm future;many meeting;marketing;markets;meetings;mid1960s;montreal;montreal agglomeration;montreal island;movement;municipality;new farm;nonfarm;nonfarm actor;nonfarm citizen;nonfarmers;operations;organic produce;parks;part;period;periurban;periurban actor;periurban farming;possibilities;presentations;pressures;produce;production;project;protect;reinforcement;research;research project;research role;reserves;roles;rural area;senneville;several jurisdiction;several periurban;society;sought;specific project;system;system movement;threeyear;threeyear period;usa;value;vision;vulnerability;west,action;action research;agriculture;case;case study;montreal;montreal region;periurban;periurban agriculture;region;research;study;vulnerability,373

We employ this mapping technology to discuss a new social theory of poverty that moves away from income poverty to an economy that directly produces individuals' basic needs. Focusing on urban farming in Philadelphia as an example, we use OSM to support the argument that money, land, labor, and capital do not limit food production in the city. OSM is a type of “commons” that allows community members to depict features of interest to them that might otherwise be underrepresented in official or commercially produced maps such as Google Maps. Using the concept of facilitated volunteered geographic information (VGI) we developed an open framework for combining residents' local knowledge of food resources with expert guidance in data input. We believe this helps overcome problems with ad hoc data submission efforts to which collaborative online projects are susceptible. The program for “tagging” food resources in OSM was deployed in a public “map-a-thon” event we organized in Philadelphia, bringing together technical experts and food enthusiasts.

If urban open data can be useful in answering the ""What?"" of a city, the methods and tools we develop can help answering the ""Why?"" and thus deepen our understanding of urban areas, and how we can plan for sustainable cities",archives;archiving practices;artistic research;intangible cultural heritage;open data;participatory design;smart city learning;urban gardening communities,computer programming;computer science;archives;archiving practices;intangible cultural heritages;open datum;participatory design;smart cities;urban growth,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9781467382328,,,English,"Proc - Int Conf Cult Comput, Cult Comput",Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84964894718,2,Sweden;Norway,Sweden,school of arts and communication;tromso academy of contemporary art,school of arts and communication,aims;archival;archival practice;archive exploring;archives;area;areas;cities;city;complement;contexts;create;create design;culture;culture heritage;data;design;design intervention;development;digital;digital archive;explores;help;heritage;image;intangible culture;intervention;interventions;kind;living;methods;neighbourhood;open data;paper;paper explores;particular neighbourhood;plan;possibilities;practices;project;project living;prototype tool;prototypes;provocation;qualitative;qualitative kind;relevant;relevant possibility;research;research intervention;research theme;roles;society;sources;sustainable city;theme;tools;urban area;urban development;various context,archival;archival practice;cities;city archival;data;open data;practices;smarter;smarter city,376

However, few studies have focused on the intensity of periurban farms that participate in such SFSCs, compared with the performance of the other farms. In this paper, we examined the relationship between agricultural intensity and the market orientation in a representative sample of farms in the urban region of Pisa (Italy). We define agricultural intensity as the intensity of land use and its main drivers (e.g., farm management or the individual characteristics of farmers), and market orientation as the ratio of farm produce within conventional, short or mixed food-supply chains. The results suggest that the market orientation of peri-urban farming systems is more correlated to the indicators of farm management and land use intensity than to the individual farmer’s characteristics. This result provides the first evidence that market orientation is a driver of intensity, and that individual farmer’s characteristics are not significantly different in the three groups of market orientation. These findings could be generalised to other urban areas and correlated with the main orientation of farming systems in order to support both the assessment of farming systems and the implementation of innovative urban food policies",farm management;food supply chains;periurban agriculture;tuscany,agricultural economics;agricultural management;agricultural market;agricultural policy;alternative agriculture;food supply;supply chain management;urban region;italy;pisa [tuscany];tuscany,"Filippini, R.; Institute of Life Sciences, Scuola Superiore Sant’AnnaItaly; email: rosalia.filippini@gmail.com",,Page Press Publications,11254718,,,,English,Ital J Agron,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84961159719,4,Italy;France,Italy,institute of life sciences;polytechnic institute,institute of life sciences,agricultural intensity;agriculture;areas;assessment;chain sfscs;chains;characteristics;define;driver;driver e;drivers;e;economic opportunity;evidence;farm;farm management;farm produce;farmers;farmer’s;farmer’s characteristic;farms;findings;first evidence;food;food policy;food supply;foodsupply;foodsupply chain;g;groups;implementation;indicators;individual characteristic;individual farmer’s;innovative urban;intensity;italy;land;land use;main driver;main orientation;management;market;market orientation;mixed foodsupply;opportunity;order;orientation;paper;performance;periurban;periurban farm;periurban farming;pisa;pisa italy;policies;pressure;produce;ratio;region;relationship;representative;representative sample;result;result suggest;results;sample;sfscs;short food;studies;suggest;supply;supply chain;support;sustainable farming;systems;urban area;urban food;urban pressure;urban region;use;use intensity,agricultural intensity;chains;choice;commercial market;farm’s;food;food supply;indicator;intensity;market;periurban;periurban farming;short food;supply;supply chain;systems,377

Yet many urban farms are concerned with other factors in addition to food production, and thus have incorporated social goals into their missions. The purpose of this paper is to identify the social missions of urban farms in the USA, their extent, and explores differences and similarities among farms with varying missions. Design/methodology/approach – The authors use primary data collected from a 2012 national survey of urban farmers in the USA. In total, 35 questions, covering the 2012 farm year, targeted production and marketing practices, risks and challenges, information and technical assistance needs, farm size and location, age of primary farmer, and farm characteristics. A multinomial logistic model was used to analyze the social missions of urban farms in the sample. Findings – The authors find that food production is an essential part of the mission for all urban farms. Some farms have social missions, as well, which the survey results indicate are related to food security, education, and community building. The authors find that all urban farms, regardless of their mission, are relatively small and face similar challenges in terms of providing the primary farmer with a living. Farms with explicit social missions, relative to those with a strict market orientation, donate a higher share of food from their farm and are less likely to own farmland. Urban farms located in with lower median income are more likely to have social goals related to building community or improving security food security. Originality/value – Urban agriculture is becoming more prevalent in many developed nations. At the same time, social entrepreneurship is gaining traction. Given the limited ability of urban farms in terms of food production, the social mission of urban farms arises as a possible explanation for the recent growth. This paper provides insight into a new phenomenon, and uses new data to provide insight into size, types of farms, and farmer well-being and address the social missions of urban farms in the USA",community building;economics;food security;social entrepreneurship;urban agriculture,agricultural land;agricultural worker;agriculture;education;food industry;food security;human;human experiment;marketing;model;statistical model;traction therapy;wellbeing,"Dimitri, C.; Department of Nutrition, Food Studies, and Public Health, New York UniversityUnited States; email: carolyn.dimitri@nyu.edu",,Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.,0007070X,,,,English,Br Food J,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84959378825,3,United States,United States,department of nutrition;pennsylvania state university,department of nutrition,ability;addition;address;age;agriculture;analyze;arises;assistance;assistance need;author use;authors;building;building community;challenges;characteristics;city;community;community building;data;designmethodologyapproach;designmethodologyapproach –;developed;differences;donate;education;entrepreneur seek;entrepreneurs;entrepreneurship;essential part;explanation;explicit;explores;extent;face;factors;farm;farm arises;farm characteristic;farm size;farm year;farmer;farmer wellbeing;farmers;farmland;farms;findings;food;food production;food security;goals;growth;income;indicate;information;insight;limited ability;living;location;logistic model;market;market orientation;marketing;marketing practice;median;median income;mission;missions;model;money;multinomial;national survey;nations;needs;new data;new phenomenon;orientation;originalityvalue;originalityvalue –;paper;part;phenomenon;possible explanation;practices;prevalent;primary;primary data;primary farmer;production;provide;purpose;purpose –;questions;recent growth;relative;result indicate;results;risks;sample;security;security food;seek;share;similar challenge;similarities;size;social entrepreneurship;social goal;social mission;strict;strict market;survey;survey result;technical assistance;terms;time;traction;types;urban agriculture;urban farm;urban farmer;urban farming;usa;use;use primary;uses;year;–,agriculture;consumers;producers;urban agriculture,378

We present initial findings from our research with an urban gardeners’ association as it attempts to transform informal or clandestine garden spaces into an ‘urban agricultural park’. This coalition of gardeners from diverse socioeconomic and ethnic backgrounds is reclaiming land and using a participatory design process to create a shared space. They hope to grow vegetables and to re-grow ‘community’ by forging shared experiences in the neighbourhood. We describe how we used Photovoice as a process for exploring residents’ motivations in planting informal and community gardens on public land. What visions of sustainability and the contemporary city emerge from the practice of urban gardening? What kinds of urban gardening practices produce ‘communities of practice’ that cross ethnic, socioeconomic, and generational lines?

Therefore, I review here electronic identification applications to support plant health and production and agricultural sustainability. The major points are as follows: (1) there is a tenfold increase of literature on the application of radio frequency identification in agriculture from 2000–2004 to 2005–2009. (2) Development of quick response code and radio frequency identification solutions are improving automated systems. (3) There is a major advancement in associating thermal sensors to electronic tags to preserve food quality and to manage temperature-controlled supply chain. Whereas tests with biosensors used for biological or chemical alerts are limited. (4) Agrochemical tagging, using radio frequency identification tags, improve plant health management and environmental monitoring. (5) While phytosanitary certifications are mandatory in high-cost cultivation systems and a need for risk management may promote radiofrequency identification (RFID) systems, the lack of specific economic analyses may discourage farmers and investors",food safety;phytosanitary certifications;qr;rfid;urban farming,agricultural technology;alternative agriculture;automation;certification;electronic equipment;electronics industry;food quality;food safety;literature review;sensor;sustainability;urban agriculture,"Luvisi, A.; Department of Agriculture, Food and Environment, University of Pisa, Via del Borghetto 80, Italy; email: andrea.luvisi@unisalento.it",,Springer-Verlag France,17740746,,,,English,Agron Sustainable Dev,Review,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84959116688,1,Italy,Italy,department of agriculture;department of biological and environmental sciences and technologies,department of agriculture,actual use;advancement;agricultural sustainability;agriculture;agrochemical tagging;alerts;analyses;application;applications;automated system;automation;biosensors;certifications;chain;chemical;chemical alert;code;cultivation;cultivation system;development;discourage;discourage farmer;economic analysis;efficiency;electronic identification;electronic tag;environmental monitoring;farmers;food;food quality;frequency;frequency identification;health;health management;highcost;highcost cultivation;identification;identification application;identification rfid;identification solution;identification tag;identification tool;improve plant;increase;investors;lack;literature;major advancement;major point;manage;management;mandatory;monitoring;need;phytosanitary certification;plant;plant health;points;preserve;preserve food;product;product quality;production;production efficiency;promote;promote radiofrequency;quality;quick;quick response;radio;radio frequency;radiofrequency;radiofrequency identification;response;response code;review;rfid;rfid system;risk;risk management;sensors;solutions;supply;supply chain;support;support plant;sustainability;systems;tags;tenfold;tenfold increase;tests;thermal;thermal sensor;tools;use;whereas,agriculture;electronic identification;food;identification;identification technology;plant;review;technology,381

However, there is hitherto limited knowledge of the efficiency and scaling up of practices of urban farming. Here, we review the claims on urban agriculture’s comparative performance relative to conventional food production. Our main findings are as follows: (1) benefits, such as reduced embodied greenhouse gases, urban heat island reduction, and storm water mitigation, have strong support in current literature. (2) Other benefits such as food waste minimization and ecological footprint reduction require further exploration. (3) Urban agriculture benefits to both food supply chains and urban ecosystems vary considerably with system type. To facilitate the comparison of urban agriculture systems we propose a classification based on (1) conditioning of the growing space and (2) the level of integration with buildings. Lastly, we compare the predicted environmental performance of the four main types of urban agriculture that arise through the application of the taxonomy. The findings show how taxonomy can aid future research on the intersection of urban food production and the larger material and energy regimes of cities (the “urban metabolism”)",building integrated agriculture;industrial ecology;life cycle assessment;quantitative sustainability assessment;urban agriculture;urban food systems;urban metabolism,ecological footprint;food production;food supply;heat island;industrial ecology;life cycle analysis;stormwater;sustainability;sustainable development;urban agriculture;urbanization,"Goldstein, B.; Quantitative Sustainability Assessment Division Producktionstorvet, Technical University of Denmark, Building 424, Room 225, Denmark; email: bgol@dtu.dk",,Springer-Verlag France,17740746,,,,English,Agron Sustainable Dev,Review,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84955493048,4,Denmark;United States,Denmark,technical university of denmark;technical university of denmark;department of architecture;technical university of denmark,technical university of denmark,agriculture;agriculture benefit;agriculture system;agriculture’s;aid;aid future;application;arise;benefit;benefits;buildings;chains;cities;claims;classification;combat;comparative;comparative performance;compare;comparison;conditioning;conventional food;current literature;demand;ecological footprint;ecosystem vary;ecosystems;efficiency;energy;energy regime;environmental performance;environmental pressure;exploration;facilitate;findings;food;food demand;food production;food supply;food waste;footprint;footprint reduction;future;future research;gases;greenhouse;greenhouse gas;heat;heat island;hitherto;integration;intersection;island;island reduction;knowledge;level;limited knowledge;literature;main finding;main type;material;means;metabolism”;minimization;mitigation;performance;performance relative;practices;pressure;production;propose;reduction;reduction require;regimes;relative;require;research;review;show;space;storm;storm water;strong support;supply;supply chain;support;system;system type;systems;taxonomy;type;types;urban agriculture;urban agriculture’s;urban ecosystem;urban farming;urban food;urban heat;urbanization;vary;waste;waste minimization;water;water mitigation;“urban;“urban metabolism”,agriculture;conventional agriculture;profiles;resource;resource profile;review;taxonomy;urban versus;versus,382

Here, we hypothesized that societal preferences and the acceptability of urban agriculture projects and products are ruling the success or failure of urban agriculture businesses. We surveyed 386 urban participants in Berlin, Germany, to identify general preferences for the productive use of urban space, the acceptance of different urban agriculture forms, and demands and expectations regarding urban agriculture products. The results show first that more than 80 % of the respondents preferred having accessible systems such as public green spaces, intercultural gardens, and rooftop gardens. Indeed, land uses that do not provide accessibility such as meadows, aquaponic farms, or intensive agricultural and horticultural landscapes showed lower acceptance, of less than 40 %. Second, 60 % of participants expressed acceptance of rooftop farming, agriculture in the urban fringe, or in inner-city brownfields, whereas 65 % rejected to have agriculture in multi-story buildings, agroparks, or aquaponic farms. Third, more than 50 % are willing to buy horticultural products, but they reject products from intensive production systems and animal-farming mechanisms, with more than 70 % rejection for animal products. Overall, this is the first study to investigate entrepreneurial urban agriculture possibilities from the perspective of potential consumers. The main insight is that the highest degree of acceptance is reached for multifunctional urban agriculture that combines commercial with ecological and social goals.

It is purposely designed to grow in a box to enable the easy stacking of boxes in a space-constrained urban place. The power can be sourced out from a commercial power or from the sun light using solar photovoltaic energy harvesting technology making it a standalone, ready-to-deploy food source in a disaster-hit area. Aside from organic substrate and mushroom seed, each box is equipped with low cost set of electronic components, small fan and a humidifier which facilitate the automated cultivation process. This system is not only useful for urban farming and disaster-hit-area deployment but also valuable for research purposes. It has an option to interface into a computer in a laboratory setting to precisely monitor, analyze and determine the factors that influences the optimum growth of mushroom.

These gardening practices respond to urban pressures and open new modes of green space governance, presenting alternative and multifunctional ways to manage and revitalise cities. Focusing on the case of Geneva, the article unfolds two levels of discussion. On the one hand—and with reference to the theorist Haber-mas—it examines how multiple actors with different interests interplay and cooperate with each other in order to negotiate over open space, while discussing implications for local politics and planning. On the other hand, it describes how these negotiations result in new, innovative, and hybrid forms of public green space. The main findings indicate emerging forms of collaboration, partnerships, and governance patterns that involve public and private sectors and increase participation by civil society actors. Cooperation amongst several interested groups and the collective re-invention of public urban spaces increase these spaces’ accessibility for multiple users and actors, as well as present possibilities for alternative and diversified uses and activities.

In the long run, utilization of inorganic fertilizer has raised concern towards health as well as environmental issues. More and more rural lands are turning unsuitable for farming due to the pollution of land and water by factory farms. Nonetheless, in urban agriculture, the use of inorganic fertilizer in such proximity to residential area is detrimental to health over a long period of time. In order of making urban farming viable in the sense of environmental friendly, alternatives of chemical fertilizers are getting acceptance. This project studied on the potential of utilizing vermicomposting derived liquids in urban farming fertigation. Materials and Methods: Pre-composted cow dung was used in the study. Liquids (vermiwash and vermicomposting leachate) collected were diluted to prevent leaf scorching. Chemical analysis showed the present of plant nutrients. Enhancement in chlorophyll contents (chlorophyll a, b and total chlorophyll) were observed as well as improvement in nutrients distribution in sweet potato leaf. Results: This study showed potential of vermiwash and vermicomposting leachate as organic foliar fertilizer. Conclusion: Hence, the application of these liquids in field scale urban farming fertigation is possible.

The tradition of urban nucleus from the past, both mundane and ecclesiastical, made a considerable impact on the attempts of local urban gardening and landscape architecture. Nevertheless, towards the end of the 19th century the agricultural image of urban tissue commenced undergoing changes. The city became urbanised towards its eastern parts. Communal infrastructure, schools, hospitals and the court building were slowly both reconstructed and constructed and consequently there were increasing requirements for large-scale greening, afforestation, newly planted plants and maintenance of urban landscape areas. The situation of urban gardening and landscape architecture during the period between 1880 and 1945 is analysed throughout the paper.

Urban farming activities have been developed and promoted as a part of the infrastructures that support residents’ lives in high-population-density cities. Technologyintensive CEA is emerging as a viable form of urban farming. This type of CEA is likely to include engineering and scientific solutions for the production of plants, delivery of environmental parameters, machines for material handling and process control, and information for decision support. Therefore, the deployment of CEA for urban farming requires many components, subsystems, and other external influencing factors to be systematically considered and integrated. This chapter will describe high-tech CEA as a system, provide a systems methodology (i.e., the concept of automation-culture-environment systems or ACESys), propose a decision support platform (i.e., the concurrent science, engineering, and technology or ConSEnT, computational environment), and identify challenges and opportunities in implementing integrated urban controlled environment agriculture systems or IUCEAS",controlled environment agriculture;decision support;systems informatics and analytics;systems integration;urban agriculture,decision support systems;industrial plants;materials handling;population statistics;controlled environment agricultures;decision supports;informatics;systems integration;urban agricultures;agriculture,"Lin, T.; Department of Agricultural and Biological Engineering, University of Illinois at Urbana- Champaign, 1304 W.

Similarities and differences between them as well as detailed insights into specific farm characteristics are widely absent in scientific discourses. This paper compares farm structures, success factors, obstacles, clients' expectations, and policy wishes between specialized, differentiated, and diversified farms as well as diversifiers into agriculture. A standardized questionnaire was used for 21 personal in-depth farm interviews located in metropolitan areas of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. Being located in a metropolitan area is the most often named Unique Selling Proposition (USP). This is also mentioned as most important success factor followed by sociability and personal contact to clients, which both underpin the importance of direct producer-consumer linkages in urban settings. Additionally, it is assumed that a single food criterion is not sufficient to be successful, but several have to be merged to meet clients' expectations. In terms of marketing, differentiated and diversified farmers prefer a multi-channel approach, while specialized farmers and diversifiers into agriculture focus mainly on one specific channel. While both specialized farmers and diversifiers into agriculture cultivate smaller areas of farmland, the latter one offers the greatest number of jobs including those outside agricultural production.

We analysed the spatial distribution of basic land-use classes (built-up areas, cropland, forests) together with demographic and socioeconomic indicators with the aim to evaluate the differential impact of compact urban expansion and dispersed urbanization on peri-urban farming. Alternating distinct expansion waves over the last 50 years, Athens' metropolitan region, Greece, was selected as the case study. Although per-capita built-up area was higher in the 'dispersed' urban wave compared with the 'compact' wave, cropland was the most vulnerable class to urbanization. A high rate of conversion from forests to cropland (in turn abandoned and, finally, developed) was observed since the early 1990s. This process is associated to land fragmentation and soil degradation driven by illegal housing and real estate speculation. Land-use changes are a target for policies mitigating soil consumption and promoting periurban agriculture on Mediterranean fringe land.

On this basis, the article takes ancient Chinese cities of feudal times as research objects, and explores the influence of farming activities and rural relations on these cities. Mainly through literature review and deductive reasoning, and partly using typological analysis and ideological analysis methods, it finds out that whether in watercourses, vestibules, backyards or gardens, the urban space in ancient China was saturated with various kinds of ""farming elements"", such as livestock, grains, fruits, vegetables, flowers, etc. Through analyzing their existence, spatial distribution and values, the article tries to interpret the characteristics and significance of these urban farming elements and spaces that were deeply shaped by the Chinese philosophy of ""Unity of Man and Nature"" and profoundly influenced by agricultural civilization.

In order to underscore its importance for a subsistence economy, the author therefore prefers the term 'urban agriculture' (Agrarkultur). The thesis of the article is that community gardening is a social movement dominated by women that brings previously hidden housework back into public view. In older European societies, the house and garden of a homestead were women's domains. The garden was part of the 'household economy'. The significance of both female housework and the subsistence economy is often overlooked. The Stein and Hardenberg reforms of 1806-1813 promoted the suppression of peasants' rights to use the commons: land, meadows, woods, lakes. One result was that widows lost their means of homesteading (subsistence farming) and poverty drove them into cities and towns. But a female-dominated subsistence economy would return. In the late nineteenth century, Max Weber described how farmhands' wives managed an autonomous subsistence economy, which gave them some degree of independence. Interestingly, homesteading reappeared in the 1960s in the context of so-called 'real socialism' under the label of 'individual household economy' (individuelle Hauswirtschaft). The Imperial Allotment Garden Regulation of 1919 demanded the right to allotments for people in need. To this end, municipalities were entitled to seize land. During the Second World War, women throughout the country were forced to contribute to the nation's supply of fresh vegetables from their home gardens, allotments and from newly set up 'victory gardens'.

The reported case study involved 47 students during a two-weeks intensive course on the topic of urban gardening. Observations were collected during three distinctive phases: the co-design phase, the creation of an open design, and the sharing of these design solutions on the online platform Instructables.com.The open sharing of local solutions triggered more global discussions, based on several types of feedback: from simple questions to reference to existing works and from suggestions to critiques. Also, some examples of re-appropriation of the designed solutions were reported. These feedbacks show the possibilities for students to have a global vision on their local solutions, confronting them with a wider and more diverse audience. The case study shows, on the other hand, the difficulty in keeping students engaged in this global discussion, considering how after a few weeks the online discussions dropped to an almost complete silence. It is also very difficult with such online platforms to follow the re-appropriation cycles, losing the possibility of exploring the new local context where the replication/modification of the designed product occurred. The course's focus on open design is interesting from both the design and educational points of view. It implies a deep change in the teaching approach and learning attitude of students, allowing unknown peers to take part in the design process and fostering a global discussion starting from unique and local solutio",adaptation process;co-design;community-based practice;diy;industrial design;learning objects;open design;open education;reusability,,,,Athabasca University,14923831,,,,English,Int Rev Res Open Distance Learn,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84988432033,5,Belgium,Belgium,department of industrial systems engineering and product design;university of applied sciences,department of industrial systems engineering and product design,approach;attitude;audience;case;case study;change;codesign;codesign phase;com;complete silence;context;course;course focus;courses;creation;critiques;cycles;deep;deep change;design;design engineering;design process;design solution;difficulty;discussion;discussions;distinctive;distinctive phase;diverse;diverse audience;educational point;engage;engineering;examples;explores;feedback;feedback show;feedbacks;focus;gardening;global discussion;global vision;hand;implies;indirect;indirect stakeholder;industrial design;instructables;intensive course;local context;local solutio;local solution;observations;online;online discussion;online platform;open design;opportunities;part;peers;phase;phases;platform;platform instructables;platforms;points;possibilities;possibility;process;product;questions;reappropriation;reappropriation cycle;reference;replicationmodification;results;several type;show;shows;silence;simple;simple question;solutio;solutions;stakeholders;student;students;study;study explores;study show;suggestions;topic;twoweeks;types;unique;unknown peer;urban gardening;view;vision;weeks;wider;works,case;case study;design;design engineering;discussions;education;engineering;gardening;global discussion;industrial design;open design;openness;reappropriation;role;study;theme;trigger;urban gardening,402

Food security comprises availability and affordability. In the context of North American and Western European societies, only food affordability normally merits public discourse. In practice, governments have little or no means to change food affordability, in view of prevailing capitalistic free-market structures. In the current wave of popular exuberance, civic politicians and others have promoted the belief that community gardening could be the pathway to produce affordable food. The formidable obstacles to this pursuit include the availability of (low-cost) land within the highly-densified city limit, insufficient ambient temperature and water supply during the growing season and the contemporary structure of society.

Public gardening not only visually improves the environment, but it also creates a range of public spaces and “other” places in which urban citizens can come together; eventually it could help to enhance the image of distressed neighbourhoods. Such community initiatives can be divided into sanctioned intervention and unauthorised intervention (“commoning”); unauthorised intervention is when residents are displeased with their surroundings and attempt to improve their environment in their own way. This paper explores the limitations of the practices of commoning as a source of regeneration and compares its cultural dimensions.

This article introduces a protocol to identify and map locations associated with different media frames. We apply QHGIS to urban gardening and soil lead issues reported in Sacramento, California. We find that the QHGIS method enhances conventional approaches to case study archival research and media analysis because it reveals: (a) the distribution of public narratives of environmental concern across the city, (b) the politics embedded in location names, (c) place name-changes that might otherwise lead to inaccurate GIS analysis, and (d) how locations can be used as a framing device to communicate environmental concerns.

The new forms of open spaces (e. g. urban gardening) not only demonstrate an interest in participation and appropriation of public space but also a growing desire for nature as such. On the other hand there is evidence of increased domestication and alienation from nature. In nature-experience spaces, being minimally designed natural areas, children have the opportunity to autonomously discover nature and create their own rules of play. Intense contact with a natural environment leads to improved social competence and strengthened self-competence, which translates into creativity, motivation, autonomy, ability to concentrate and language skills. There is also evidence for the link between experiencing nature and environmentally responsible behavior.

The maintenance of vacant lands and eventual transformation to sustainable land uses is a challenge all cities face, but one that is particularly pronounced in shrinking cities. Vacant lands can support sustainability initiatives, specifically the expansion of urban gardens and local food production. However, many shrinking cities are the same aging cities that have experienced the highest soil lead burdens from their industrial past as well as the historic use of lead-based paint and leaded gasoline. Elevated soil lead is often viewed as a barrier to urban agriculture and managing for multiple ecosystem services, including food production and reduced soil lead exposure, remains a challenge. In this paper, we argue that a shift in framing the soil lead and gardening issue from potential conflict to potential solution can advance both urban sustainability goals and support healthy gardening efforts. Urban gardening as a potential solution to the soil lead problem stems from investment in place and is realized through multiple activities, in particular (1) soil management, including soil testing and the addition of amendments, and (2) social network and community building that leverages resources and knowledge",agriculture;gardening;lead;metals;shrinking cities;soil;sustainability;urban,alternative agriculture;ecosystem service;garden;lead;social network;soil amendment;soil management;soil pollution;soil test;sustainable development;urban area,"Schwarz, K.; Department of Biological Sciences, Northern Kentucky UniversityUnited States; email: schwarzk1@nku.edu",,MDPI AG,20711050,,,,English,Sustainability,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84960417510,4,United States,United States,department of biological sciences;department of natural resources and environmental science;department of human ecology;department of plant sciences,department of biological sciences,activities;addition;advance;agriculture;amendments;argue;barrier;building;burdens;challenge;cities;city face;community;community building;conflict;ecosystem;ecosystem service;efforts;eventual transformation;expansion;exposure;face;food;food production;gardening;gardening effort;gardens;gasoline;goals;healthy gardening;historic;historic use;industrial past;initiatives;investment;issue;knowledge;land;lands;landscape;lead;lead burden;lead exposure;lead problem;leverage resource;leverages;local food;maintenance;management;multiple;multiple activity;multiple ecosystem;network;paint;paper;particular soil;past;patchwork;place;potential conflict;potential solution;problem;problem stem;production;remains;resources;services;shift;shrink;social network;soil;soil lead;soil management;solution;stems;support;support sustainability;sustainability;sustainability goal;sustainability initiative;sustainable land;transformation;urban agriculture;urban garden;urban gardening;urban sustainability;use;uses;vacancy;vacant;vacant land,cities;gardens;lead;lead problem;problem;soil;soil lead;solution,408

These pollutants (trace metals) are more likely to have an adverse effect on peri-urban agriculture which is now becoming a permanent feature of the landscape of many urban cities in the world. This review reports on the concentrations of trace metals in crops, including leafy vegetables harvested from different urban areas, thus highlighting the presence of trace metals in leafy vegetables. Various pathways of uptake of trace metals by leafy vegetables, such as the foliar and roots, and possible health risks associated with urban faming are discussed and various morphological and physiological impacts of trace metals in leafy vegetables are described. Defensive mechanisms and positive aspects of trace metals in plants are also highlighted",human health;pollution;soil;vegetables,concentration (composition);diet;leafy vegetable;pollutant;public health;trace metal;urban agriculture;urban area,"Olowoyo, J.O.; Department of Biology, Sefako Makgatho Health Sciences University, PO Box 60, South Africa; email: woleolowoyo@yahoo.com",,Academy of Science of South Africa,19967489,,SAJSA,,English,S Afr J Sci,Review,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84958811435,2,South Africa,South Africa,department of biology,department of biology,adverse;adverse effect;agriculture;areas;aspects;cities;concentrations;crops;defensive;defensive mechanism;described;different urban;effect;environment;feature;foliar;health;health risk;impacts;industrialisation;landscape;leafy;leafy vegetable;mechanisms;metals;pathways;periurban;periurban agriculture;permanent;permanent feature;physiological impact;plants;pollutant trace;pollutants;positive aspect;possible health;presence;rapid industrialisation;reports;review;review report;risks;roots;trace;trace metal;uptake;urban area;urban city;urban environment;urban faming;urbanisation;various pathway;vegetables;world,diets;human;human diet;metals;possible source;source;trace;trace metal;urban farming,409

Therefore, integrated adaptation plans are essential for turning them into resilient cities. National competitiveness strategies are, however, increasingly at odds with the very idea of resilient cities, either forcing urban sprawl to its limits or transforming green spaces into grey spaces within the city. In the midst of heated conflict about how to use public land, the role of networks of local initiatives to protect green spaces and residential rights of poor and marginal groups becomes pivotal to achieve equity and urban resilience. The aim of this paper is to explore the dynamics of such networks in Istanbul and investigate how to integrate them into local climate change adaptation plans. Conflicts over Istanbul’s historical urban vegetable gardens (bostan) and the construction of the third bridge are good examples of sites of contestation which, unless resolved, seriously hinder any possibility of agreement and action on climate adaptation plans",climate change;green spaces;local adaptation;resilience;urban farming,,"Connelly, R.I.; Marmara University-EU InstituteTurkey; email: ranaizci@marmara.edu.tr",,Springer,16102002,,,,English,Climate Change Manag,Book Chapter,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85018639487,2,Turkey,Turkey,marmara university-eu institute;beykent university,marmara university-eu institute,achieve;action;adaptation;adaptation plan;agreement;aim;areas;becomes;bostan;bridge;change;change adaptation;cities;city;climate;climate adaptation;climate change;coastal;coastal city;competitiveness;competitiveness strategy;conflict;conflicts;construction;contestation;dynamics;engines;equity;examples;explore;garden bostan;gardens;good example;green space;grey;grey space;group becomes;groups;growth;high sensitivity;hinder;historical urban;idea;impacts;initiatives;integrate;investigate;istanbul;istanbul’s;land;large coastal;limits;local climate;local initiative;marginal group;midst;national competitiveness;national growth;networks;odds;paper;pivotal;plans;possibility;protect;protect green;public;public land;residential right;resilience;resilient;resilient city;rights;role;sensitivity;sites;spaces;sprawl;strategies;tend;third bridge;urban resilience;urban sprawl;urban vegetable;use;use public;vegetable;vegetable garden,adaptation;case;climate;climate adaptation;istanbul;local network;networks;resilience,410

The passive approaches include landscape urbanism, urban farming, vertical greening, introduction of water corridor: Tree corridor, adaptive reuse of underutilised spaces, urban street art, etc. at macro (city) level and xeriscaping, rain gardens, green roofs, passive solar landscaping, passive drip irrigation, etc., at micro (site) level. In this study 30 different types of techniques have been identified for micro level application. These methods utilize natural gravity, natural processes, natural energy sources and limit to the usage of active energy sources. For each technique, the approach and its environmental effects have been compared and analysed for existing as well as proposed urban landscape. The comparative data of such passive techniques clearly states the result of practicing traditional approaches for urban future. The research identifies the conservation of soil, water, air, energy and species is the prime method for the connection of the fragmented landscapes into one urban green mass.

In the 1920s, the Common was converted to victory gardens. In 1943, Boston’s first community gardens were set up by the city, lining the Back Bay Fens and spreading out across the City of Boston. Today, Boston is home to nearly 200 community gardens, six urban farms comprising twelve plots, dozens of community orchards, and over 100 school gardens. However, commercial urban agriculture wasn’t mentioned in Boston’s existing zoning code prior to 2013, and was, therefore, implicitly not legal. In the fall of 2013, the City successfully passed a new zoning article, Article 89, which allows for commercial urban agriculture, and defines use regulations in the city’s various zoning districts (http://www.bostonredevelopmentauthority.org/planning/planning-initiatives/urban-agriculture-rezoning). The anticipated outcomes of Article 89 are far reaching—local employment opportunity, increased access to nutritious food, a more resilient food economy, and an increase in fresh food access—to name a few. The 3-year process that led to Article 89 featured extensive community conversation with advocates and dissenters, organizations and individuals. After an extensive pilot project and community outreach effort, eleven neighborhood meetings, a twitter chat, eighteen Urban Agriculture Working Group meetings, and multiple drafts of Article 89, it was passed by the Zoning Commission in December 2013.

The emphasis is put on the part of the population known in Europe and the world under the micro-ethnonym Bulgarian gardeners. In accordance with statistic, demographic, cultural and ethnographic research, there are indications that most of the Bulgarians who currently live in Croatia - and there are 350 of them according to the 2011 census - are the descendants of this population and almost half of them live in Zagreb. It is important to say that this economic migrant population is characterised as a European and world, i.e. Global economic, social and cultural phenomenon. The paper is divided into several parts. The first part analyses the reasons of emigration from the domicile area, the chronology of emigration and the typology in accordance with classical, neoclassical and modern migration theories, as well as migration destinations chosen by the migrants on the basis of precisely defined criteria. Furthermore, the formation of economic shelters, i.e. Their position on migration areas is discussed, as well as the organisation of work and life, technology of vegetable growing, economic prosperity, structural characteristics of the community and their transformation, stagnation of production and the gradual abandonment of their practice and profession from late 1980s onwards.

Meanwhile, the spectrum of social phenomena that are labelled as socially innovative is quite diverse and heterogeneous, ranging from urban gardening projects to swapping and sharing platforms to Do-It-Yourself workshops. This article describes a research project where sixty-two cases of potential social innovations for sustainable consumption were analysed, based on a process model combining innovation and practice theory. Thorough document and case analyses revealed five distinguishable types of innovation: Do-It-Together, Strategic Consumption, Sharing Communities, Do-It-Yourself and Utility-enhancing Consumption. These are mainly characterised by differences along four dimensions - innovativeness, formality, communality and personal engagement - each of which is connected to potential problems and advantages in the process of initiation and stabilisation of innovative practices. Based on this typology, type-specific measures to overcome problems and strengthen advantages are presented which help practitioners in politics, administration, associations and foundations to support social innovations for sustainable consumption. For sustainability science the typology can add to a more thorough understanding of the multi-faceted field of social innovation for sustainable consumption. Thereby the study takes up theoretical and practical desiderata stressed by other authors in this field.

This has direct implications for the process of intra-movement building and therefore the degree to which the movement ameliorates economic inequality at the point of food labor. This article asks what accounts for the variation in AFM labor commitments across different contexts. It then appraises a range of activist perspectives, practices, and organizational approaches. The answer emerges through a comparative analysis of three California social movement organizations enmeshed in the particularities of local contentious food politics. The cases include a labor union representing grocery store and meatpacking/food processing workers, a food justice organization working to create green jobs and independent funding models, and an organic urban farming and educational organization. Commitment to fair labor standards varies due to differences in organizational capacity, the degree of dedication to ending economic inequality in local activist culture, and the openness of local political and economic institutions to working class struggles. The article concludes with a discussion of how these findings inform our understanding of the process of cooperation and division in the AFM, particularly regarding the complexities and contradictions of using food labor to combat economic inequality.

This lack of knowledge impedes its inclusion in public policies of urban planning. A substantial body of literature deals with urban agriculture but little research has analyzed the multidimensional city-agriculture interactions facilitating its enduring presence within the city. We suggest the hypothesis that informal processes are at the core of the persistence of urban agriculture and propose the concept of socio-spatial arrangements (SSAs) between the actors. To study urban agriculture in Bobo-Dioulasso, a West African city, we propose to develop a geography of arrangements to understand the social and spatial characteristics of SSAs and the way they influence urban agriculture development. Taking the example of market gardeners and pig breeders, we highlight how farmers overcome urban constraints through localized social networks. Results show that arrangements between the actors are at the core of the persistence of urban agriculture. We underline two different socio-spatial morphologies (SSMs) of urban agriculture according to differences in urban agriculture characteristics. These SSMs illustrate how market gardeners and pig breeders integrate differently into the urban space. The systemic approach of studying arrangements between actors helps us understand how urban farming activities function, and how they are connected to each other and to the urban and regional system, thus building a picture of an agri-urban system. We discuss the policy and theoretical implications of this research.

Research has shown that UA can have several positive impacts on the social and environmental health of a city. Increasingly, the question of the role of professional farmers is raised. The Food Urbanism Initiative (FUI; see www.foodurbanism.org/lausanne) explicitly looks at this via its use of Lausanne, Switzerland as a case study site. In the first phase, the research team assessed the population's attitude towards UA by means of a public survey. It concludes that although UA is not the most important publicly perceived urban issue, it is well supported. Presently, the case study work includes the assessment of the existing physical opportunities and the possible various typologies of urban farming that could apply to the site. Current research is investigating the potential of urban farming for professional farmers. Additionally, the success of a series of city initiated pilot projects (micro community plots/plantages, traditional family gardens, sheep keeping and the pedagogic farm of Rovereaz Domain) reinforces the importance of UA and its implementation via diverse methods. However, the FUI Lausanne urban analysis so far indicates that although there are many potential sites for UA, many of them are small, privately-owned, and disconnected parcels. There are serious constraints for traditional professional farming in urban areas as far as economic and agronomic aspects are concerned, leaving agricultural production in urban areas to be tended by urban ""gardeners"" or quasiprofessionals. Principal issues concern both the legal limits to professional farming and restrictions related to the scale of a successful agricultural operation. Urban and peri-urban farmers may have increased opportunities for commercialisation and partnerships with urban population. Consequently, the FUI challenge is to find the most applicable array of realistic UA project typologies while at the same time doing so with an expanded notion regarding the future role of professional, semiprofessional and ""hobby"" farme",socio-economic typology;urban food producers,,,Mauget J.C.Godet S.,International Society for Horticultural Science,05677572,9789462610965,,,English,Acta Hortic,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84951325766,6,Switzerland,Switzerland,swiss federal institute of technology zurich;school of agricultural,swiss federal institute of technology zurich,agricultural operation;agricultural production;agriculture;agriculture ua;agronomic aspect;analysis;applicable array;areas;array;aspects;assessment;attitude;attitude towards;case;case study;challenge;city;commercialisation;community;community plotsplantages;concern;concludes;constraints;current research;decade;diverse;diverse method;domain;domain reinforces;environmental health;family;family garden;farm;farme;farmers;food;food urbanism;foodurbanism;fui;fui challenge;fui lausanne;future;future role;gardeners;gardens;health;hobby;hobby farme;impacts;implementation;importance;indicates;initiative;initiative fui;interest;issue;issue concern;issues;last decade;lausanne;legal limit;limits;looks;many potential;means;methods;micro;micro community;notion;operation;opportunities;orglausanne;parcels;partnerships;pedagogic;pedagogic farm;periurban;periurban farmer;phase;physical opportunity;pilot;pilot project;plotsplantages;population;population attitude;populations;positive impact;potential site;principal;principal issue;production;professional farmer;professional farming;project;project micro;project typology;projects;public;public survey;quasiprofessionals;question;realistic ua;reinforces;research;research team;restrictions;role;rovereaz;rovereaz domain;scale;series;serious constraint;sheep;site;sites;study;study site;study work;success;survey;switzerland;team;time;towards;traditional family;traditional professional;typologies;ua;ua project;urban agriculture;urban analysis;urban area;urban farming;urban gardener;urban issue;urban population;urbanism;urbanism initiative;use;various typology;work;www,agriculture;case;case study;farmers;opportunity;study;swiss case;urban agriculture,424

The earliest reports date back 4000 years, but the role urban horticulture has played has changed since in time and space. During periods of hunger urban horticulture is and has been production oriented while in other times aesthetics and social aspects played a more important role. Recent discussions focus on new vegetable production systems within cities. Benefits are seen in food production close to the consumer improving access to healthy fruits and vegetables having many public health benefits for local residents. Not only in developing countries but also in Europe and North America urban vegetable production systems are on the rise. Daily newspapers are flooded with reports on new technological solutions for inner-urban production systems and the importance of green within cities is getting more attention from political decision makers, scientists and the public. Since there are many hopes associated with such development there is an urgent need to discuss was does really exist and what is still fiction. The discussion needs to distinguish three settings: 1) sustainable low tech production of fruits and vegetables, 2) the production of vegetables in low tech systems emerging from a social movement, and 3) high tech food production in low energy greenhouses, often soilless and combined with new technologies for high quality products. It also should be taken into consideration that urban food production entails risks to health and the environment, if not managed and carried out properly. The present paper focusses on existing and emerging technologies and their importance as promising tool to overcome some of the problems mankind is facing due to world population growth and the existing high urbanization ra",ecological benefits;economics benefits;food supply;physical and social well-being;urban gardening systems,,,Mauget J.C.Godet S.,International Society for Horticultural Science,05677572,9789462610965,,,English,Acta Hortic,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84951299408,2,Germany,Germany,humboldt-universitat zu berlin;leibniz institute of vegetable and ornamental crops grossbeeren and erfurt e.v.,humboldt-universitat zu berlin,access;aesthetics;america;area exists;areas;aspects;attention;benefits;cities;consideration;consumer;countries;cultivation;daily newspaper;date;decision;decision maker;dense;development;discuss;discussion;discussion focus;discussion need;discussions;distinguish;energy;energy greenhouse;entail risk;entails;environment;europe;exist;exists;fiction;focus;focusses;food;food production;fruits;greenhouses;growth;health;health benefit;healthy fruit;high quality;high tech;high urbanization;hopes;horticulture;hunger;hunger urban;importance;important role;innerurban;innerurban production;intensive production;local resident;low energy;low tech;makers;mankind;many hope;movement;need;needs;new technology;new vegetable;newspapers;north;north america;overcome;paper;paper focus;periods;plants;played;political decision;populated area;population;population growth;present;present paper;problem mankind;problems;production;production entail;production system;products;promising;public;public health;quality;quality product;ra;recent discussion;report date;reports;residents;rise;risks;role;role urban;scientists;settings;social aspect;social movement;soilless;solutions;space;systems;tech;tech food;tech production;tech system;technological solution;technologies;time;times;tool;urban food;urban horticulture;urban vegetable;urbanization;urbanization ra;urgent;urgent need;vegetable;vegetable production;vegetables;world;world population;year;years,developments;facts;fiction;horticulture;horticulture fact;recent development;urban horticulture,425

As much as 80 % of farm power is provided for by human labour which now call for need to develop and possibly engage simple and avoidable equipment to replace some manual tools for farming operations. Adoption of power tillers for tilling has brought some significant changes on overall production and sustainability of small farm systems. Addressing this requires acquisition of appropriate mechanized farm, tillage tools. This began with the technical and social- economic assessment and recommendation for adoption which took place at Federal University of Agriculture, Abeokuta, South West of Nigeria based on performance efficiency, affordability, durability, acceptability and ease of operation for the smallholders. A 6 hp (4.48 kw) Husqvarna T560 RS rotary cultivator of 0.78 m width was acquired for field performance test for appraisal and adoption, for small scale farming as part of the front-end concern in the procurement- adoption chain. The effective field capacity of the machine on a land that was already under cultivation was found to be 0.033 ha/hr (i.e. 5 working days/ hectare) and about 12 hours to till one acre, in well cleared stone-free soil type where it was tested. The soil tillage of this equipment was found suitable for crops that can tolerate zero to shallow tillage depth of 0.21 m which this equipment was able to provide in the sandy loam under friable soil moisture condition. The awareness of the machine was 39 % among the farmers, 67 % rated the machine useful for tillage but the machine price range was above what their individual income can sustain in the study area.

This study seeks to estimate ""the expected GHG reduction effect"" in the case of a revitalization of urban agriculture. For this purpose, this study first calculated the area available for urban farming by targeting the metropolitan area of Seoul and then calculated the production per unit area by focusing on ""the crops suitable for urban agriculture"". Using this estimated value, the study estimated crop production, the resultant food mileage decrement, and the reduction of carbon dioxide (CO<inf>2</inf>) emissions that could be obtained if the Seoul metropolis introduced urban agriculture. The results estimated that if the Seoul metropolis implemented urban agriculture in a 51.15km2 area, it would be possible to reduce CO<inf>2</inf> emissions by 11.67 million kg annually. This numerical value is the same amount of CO<inf>2</inf> absorbed annually by 20.0km2 of pine forests and 10.2km2 of oak tree forests that are 20 years old.

However, urban/peri-urban dairy farms differ in challenges from rural dairy farms and reproduction is important and critical for assuring sustainable economic output in both environments. Here we recorded for the first time differences between two geographically and economically different cities corresponding to different settings within the same country in managerial factors influencing reproductive performance in urban/peri-urban dairy cowherds. Results: The urban/peri-urban dairy farmers in the capital Kampala were more often male (P = 0.002) and commercialized (P = 0.0025), more experienced (P = 0.0001) and practiced zero-grazing more often (P = 0.05) than in the regional municipality Gulu. Also, the milk production per herd and cow (P = 0.0005) and calving rate were (P = 0.0001) higher in Kampala and artificial insemination was more commonly (P = 0.002) used than in Gulu. There was no difference in abortion nor neonatal mortality rate between the two locations. Overall, calving rates were higher (P = 0.0003) in smaller (≤3 dairy cows) and open grazing (P = 0.003) herds. Abortion rates were higher among dairy herds practicing late (≥5 months) (P = 0.003) calf weaning and in herds with commercial purposes (P = 0.0001). Neonatal calf mortality was lower (P = 0.01) in small herds. Conclusion: The study showed significant differences between Kampala and Gulu in reproductive performance and related husbandry factors for cows in the urban/peri-urban dairy farming systems. For several reproductive performance traits we found associations with husbandry and production traits, which should be taken into account when providing advice to the urban and peri-urban dairy farmers in the tropics",bovine;dairy cow;milk production;reproductive performance;tropics;uganda;urban peri-urban farming,animal;bovine;city;dairying;female;physiology;procedures;reproduction;uganda;animals;cattle;cities;dairying;female;reproduction;uganda,"Magnusson, U.; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, Division of Reproduction, Department of Clinical Sciences, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine and Animal Sciences, P.O.

With a future world population of 9.6 billion by 2050, rising urbanization, decreasing arable land, and weather extremes due to climate change, global agriculture is under pressure. While today over 50 % of the world population live in cities, by 2030, the number will rise to 70 %. In addition, global emissions have to be kept in mind. Currently, agriculture accounts for around 20–30 % of global greenhouse gas emissions. Shifting food production to locations with high demands reduces emissions and mitigates climate change. Urban horticulture increases global food production by exploiting new locations for cultivation. However, higher land prices and urban pollution constrain urban horticulture. In this paper, we review different urban cultivation systems throughout the world. Our main findings from ecological, economical, and social aspects are: (1) Urban horticulture activities are increasing globally with at least 100 million people involved worldwide. With potential yields of up to 50 kg per m2 per year and more, vegetable production is the most significant component of urban food production which contributes to global food security. (2) Organoponic and other low-input systems will continue to play an important role for a sustainable and secure food production in the future. (3) Despite the resource efficiency of indoor farming systems, they are still very expensive. (4) Integrating urban horticulture into educational and social programs improves nutrition and food security. Overlaying these, new technologies in horticultural research need to be adopted for urban horticulture to increase future efficiency and productivity. To enhance sustainability, urban horticulture has to be integrated into the urban planning process and supported through policies.

Such farming practices pose a public health risk as livestock are reservoirs of several zoonotic pathogens. In an attempt to determine the fecal transmission between livestock and people, 100 household clusters keeping cattle in close proximity of humans were selected in urban and peri-urban areas of Morogoro in Tanzania. One hundred eighteen ampicillin and tetracycline resistant Escherichia coli (40 from human stool, 50 from cattle feces, 21 from soil and seven from water samples) were isolated from 44 different clusters. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) of XbaI digested chromosomal DNA was used to compare the genetic relatedness of the ampicillin- and tetracycline-resistant E. coli isolates. Indistinguishable PFGE band patterns of the ampicillin- and tetracycline-resistant E. coli isolates were found in samples from 23 (52%) clusters. This suggests that transfer of fecal microorganisms between cattle, humans, water and soils within the farms and from livestock farms to the neighborhood occurred commonly. Logistic regression showed that animal housing infrastructures (Odd Ratio. =. 11.2, 95% CI. =. 1.1-119.3) were associated with E. coli showing identical PFGE types within and between clusters.

This study aimed to describe and evaluate weak areas in knowledge, attitudes and practices with regards to brucellosis among urban and peri-urban small-scale dairy farmers in a low income country to generate information essential for control programmes and public health interventions. The cross-sectional study was conducted during six weeks in 2011. The study subjects were small-scale dairy farmers living in the urban and peri-urban area of the capital Dushanbe in Tajikistan. In total, 441 farmers were interviewed using a questionnaire with questions about demographic characteristics, knowledge, attitudes and practices relating to brucellosis. Descriptive statistics were used and a logistic regression model applied to evaluate potential predictors to knowledge about brucellosis. The majority (85%) of the farmers had never heard of brucellosis. Low educational level was found to be associated with low awareness of brucellosis (P = < 0.001). Respondents who talked about animal health issues with family members or friends were less likely to have heard of brucellosis compared to those who often talked to veterinarians (P = 0.03). Sixty three per cent of the participants wanted more information about brucellosis. Seventeen per cent sold unpasteurized dairy products on a regular basis direct to consumers. Almost 30% of the households consumed unpasteurized dairy products on regular basis. A majority of the respondents did not use any protection when handling cows having an abortion or when dealing with aborted materials. Poor knowledge, high-risk behaviours and a willingness to learn more strengthens the logic for including health education as part of control programmes",,"agricultural worker;animal health;article;attitude to health;awareness;brucellosis;clinical evaluation;cross-sectional study;dairy product;dairying;demography;developing country;educational status;female;high risk behavior;human;knowledge;male;prediction;self report;tajikistan;urban area;veterinarian;agriculture;animal;attitude to health;bovine;brucellosis;education;goat;health education;livestock;microbiology;pregnancy;public health;sheep;veterinary;veterinary abortion;zoonosis;animalia;abortion, veterinary;agriculture;animals;brucellosis;cattle;cross-sectional studies;dairy products;farmers;female;goats;health education;health knowledge, attitudes, practice;humans;livestock;male;pregnancy;public health;sheep;tajikistan;zoonoses",,,Public Library of Science,19326203,,POLNC,25668783.0,English,PLoS ONE,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84922622392,4,Sweden;Tajikistan,Sweden,department of clinical sciences;tajik agrarian university;department of biomedical sciences and veterinary public health,department of clinical sciences,abortion;animal;animal health;area;areas;attitudes;awareness;basis;basis direct;behaviours;brucellosis;brucellosis p;capital;capital dushanbe;cent;characteristics;consumers;control;control programme;country;cows;crosssectional;crosssectional study;dairy;dairy farmer;dairy product;demographic characteristic;describe;descriptive;descriptive statistic;dushanbe;education;educational level;evaluate;family;family member;farmer;farmer living;farmers;found;friends;generate;generate information;health;health education;health intervention;health issue;heard;highrisk;highrisk behaviour;households;impact;improvement;income;income country;infections;information;information essential;interventions;interviewed;issues;knowledge;learn;level;livestock;livestock farmer;living;logic;logistic regression;low awareness;low educational;low income;majority;materials;members;model;p;part;participants;periurban;periurban area;periurban smallscale;poor knowledge;potential predictor;practices;predictors;products;programmes;protection;public;public health;questionnaire;questions;reduction;regards;regression;regression model;regular basis;respondents;seventeen;significant impact;sixty;smallscale;smallscale dairy;statistics;strengthens;study;study subject;subjects;tajikistan;unpasteurized dairy;urban farming;urban livestock;use;veterinarian p;veterinarians;weak area;weeks;willingness;zoonotic infection,area;attitudes;brucellosis;dairy;dairy farmer;farmers;knowledge;periurban;periurban area;practices;smallscale;smallscale dairy;study;tajikistan,434

Data collected at each of six sites include continuous measures of atmospheric pollutants and microclimatic factors, and biweekly measures of physiological response and yield of various vegetable crops and cultivars.

These structural conditions in turn impact the characteristics of urban agricultural associations; specifically their membership, how they relate to other institutions, the issues they face, and the economic and social roles they play. We utilize semi-structured interviews of farmer associations and interviews with government officials in Moshi and Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania, two cities that differ in terms of their urbanization patterns and economic, environmental and institutional context, to better understand the nature of the relationship between urban agricultural organizations and the context in which they operate. We find that the manner in which groups organize, the economic role they play, the issues they are concerned with, and the degree to which they collaborate are quite variable. These differences are exacerbated by urbanization patterns that impact the role and functioning of urban agricultural organizations by placing pressure on resources such as available land and water and increasing demand for the products of urban farmers",cooperatives;tanzania;urban agriculture;urbanization,agricultural worker;organizational framework;smallholder;urban agriculture;urban economy;urbanization;dar es salaam [tanzania];kilimanjaro [tanzania];moshi;tanzania,"Schmidt, S.; Cornell University, Department of City and Regional Planning, 201 West Sibley, United States",,Elsevier Ltd,02642751,,,,English,Cities,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84912019937,3,Tanzania;United States,United States,cornell university;moshi univ. college of cooperative and business studies;tanzania horticultural association,cornell university,agricultural association;agricultural organization;argues;associations;available land;base;changes;characteristics;cities;collaborate;conditions;context;dar;dar e;degree;demand;demographic change;differ;differences;e salaam;economic base;economic role;economic structure;environmental context;es;face;farmer;farmer association;farmers;government;government official;groups;impact;institutional context;institutional landscape;institutions;interviews;issues;land;landscape;manner;membership;moshi;nature;officials;operate;organizations;paper;paper argues;patterns;placing pressure;play;pressure;products;rate;relate;relationship;resources;role;roles;salaam;social role;structural condition;structure;tanzania;terms;turn;turn impact;understand;urban farmer;urban farming;urbanization;urbanization pattern;water,agriculture;agriculture farmer;associations;farmer;farmer association;organization;tanzania;urban agriculture;urbanization,436

The community gardeners made decisions about plant choice and garden layout by first considering their previous gardening experiences and personal preferences. They then made decisions based on aesthetics, the influence of other people, and a desire to maximize their garden space. These factors led the gardeners to select certain plants at different frequencies.

It analyses its role and impact on society in a context of social and financial crisis through the lens of the debate about the commons on the basis of three case studies conducted in Brussels in 2013. The study connects the specificities of the current social and economic context with the new wave of urban gardening from a people-centred perspective. Both the motivations and the outcomes of this form of activism are analysed and led to the conclusion that being involved in urban gardening represents not only a way to cope with economic and social threats but also a tool to rebuild and reshape social bonds. The paper aims to contribute to the current debate about the commons, intended as a form of resilience and a tool of social change rather than a simple alternative economic model. It aims to do so through the analysis of urban gardening practices, which are more commonly studied from the perspective of urban agriculture, food production, access to land and urbanism",brussels;commons;gardens;social relations;urban spaces,,"Cangelosi, E.; Istituto Italiano di Scienze Umane, University of Siena and SciencesPoFrance; email: elisabetta.cangelosi@sciencespo.fr",,University of Salento,19727623,,,,English,Partecip Confl,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84959057447,1,France,France,university of siena and sciencespo,university of siena and sciencespo,access;activism;agriculture;aims;alternative;analyses;analysis;article;article study;basis;bonds;brussels;case;case study;change;commons;conclusion;connects;context;contribute;cope;crisis;current debate;debate;economic context;economic model;financial crisis;food;food production;form;gardening;gardening practice;impact;land;lens;model;motivations;new wave;outcomes;paper;paper aim;perspective;practices;production;rebuild;reshape;resilience;role;simple;simple alternative;social bond;social change;social resilience;social threat;society;specificities;studies;study;study connects;threats;tool;urban agriculture;urban gardening;urbanism;wave;way,crisis;gardening;relation urban;relations;spaces;time;urban gardening,439

However, urban soil is a natural sink for contaminants derived mainly from historical anthropogenic activities. This article reports a summary of trace metal concentrations (Cr, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Cd, and Pb) of 1,652 garden soil samples from 904 gardens in New York City. Based on the Soil Cleanup Objective (SCO) criteria developed by New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (6 NYCRR Part 375). Many of the soils analyzed exceeded the limits for Pb, Cr, As, and Cd levels. Higher percentages of home gardens are contaminated than community gardens. When accounting for Pb and As levels, about 21% of the community garden samples and 71% of the home garden samples exceed respective SCO limits. Among all home and community garden samples, less than 3% meet the criteria for unrestricted use when all trace metals are considered. There are controversies on the appropriateness of SCO criteria for urban gardening situations. Consistent soil trace metal guidelines pertaining to gardening need to be developed. Expanded soil screening, greater public awareness, and education are urgently needed to ensure safe and successful urban agriculture.

The concentrations of the trace elements arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr), copper (Cu), lead (Pb), nickel (Ni), and zinc (Zn) in five common garden crops from three garden sites in Copenhagen were measured. Concentrations (mg/kg dw) of As were 0.002-0.21, Cd 0.03-0.25, Cr < 0.09-0.38, Cu 1.8-8.7, Ni < 0.23-0.62, Pb 0.05-1.56, and Zn 10-86. Generally, elemental concentrations in the crops do not reflect soil concentrations, nor exceed legal standards for Cd and Pb in food. Hazard quotients (HQs) were calculated from soil ingestion, vegetable consumption, measured trace element concentrations and tolerable intake levels. The HQs for As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, and Zn do not indicate a health risk through urban gardening in Copenhagen. Exposure to Pb contaminated sites may lead to unacceptable risk not caused by vegetable consumption but by unintentional soil ingestion",hazard quotients;heavy metals;risk assessment;trace elements;urban gardening;urban soils,"crops;hazards;health;health risks;heavy metals;lead;nickel;risk assessment;soil pollution;soils;trace elements;vegetables;zinc;elemental concentrations;hazard quotients;potential health risks;risk to human health;soil concentrations;trace element concentrations;urban gardening;urban soils;pollution;arsenic;cadmium;chromium;copper;lead;nickel;trace element;zinc;heavy metal;soil pollutant;trace element;concentration (composition);garden;health risk;heavy metal;public health;risk assessment;trace element;urban area;article;chemical analysis;crop;denmark;environmental health;food intake;gardening;health hazard;human;nonhuman;pollution monitoring;risk assessment;risk factor;soil pollution;urban area;vegetable;analysis;chemistry;city;environmental monitoring;gardening;procedures;soil pollutant;urbanization;copenhagen [(cty) hovedstaden];denmark;hovedstaden;cities;crops, agricultural;denmark;environmental monitoring;gardening;humans;metals, heavy;risk assessment;soil pollutants;trace elements;urbanization","Hansen, M.G.; Department of Plant and Environmental Sciences, Faculty of Science, University of Copenhagen, Thorvaldsensvej 40, Denmark",,Elsevier Ltd,02697491,,ENPOE,25796073.0,English,Environ Pollut,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84925359684,6,Denmark,Denmark,department of plant and environmental sciences;department of environmental engineering,department of plant and environmental sciences,abstract;arsenic;cadmium;cadmium cd;cd;chromium;chromium cr;common garden;concentration mgkg;concentrations;consumption;copenhagen;copper;copper cu;cr;crops;cu;dw;element;element arsenic;element concentration;elemental;elemental concentration;elements;exceed;exposure;food;garden;garden crop;garden site;gardening;hazard;hazard quotient;health;health risk;hqs;indicate;ingestion;intake;investigates;lead;lead pb;legal standard;levels;mgkg;mgkg dw;ni;nickel;nickel ni;pb;potential health;quotient hq;quotients;reflect;reflect soil;risk;sites;soil;soil concentration;soil ingestion;standards;study;study investigates;tolerable intake;trace;trace element;unacceptable risk;unintentional soil;urban gardening;vegetable;vegetable consumption;zinc;zinc zn;zn,copenhagen;copenhagen pose;elements;gardening;health;human;human health;intake;pose;risk;trace;trace element;urban gardening,444

However, the meaning and motivations behind the emergence of gardening movements varies greatly over space and time. In this paper we argue that bottom up urban gardening initiatives taking place in Southern European countries in form of land occupation and communalization represent forms of resistance that enhance social cohesion and collective action in times of need. Specifically, this research examines the role of urban gardens in (i) building community resilience and (ii) articulating forms of resistance and contestation to development pressure and commodified urban lifestyles. Our research is based on data collected among 27 urban gardening initiatives in Barcelona, Spain, including 13 self-governed community gardens and 14 public gardens. Data were collected from semi-structured interviews with gardeners and with staff from the Barcelona City Council. Our results show mechanisms through which urban gardens can contribute to build resilience by nurturing social and ecological diversity, generating and transmitting local ecological knowledge, and by creating opportunities for collective action and self-organization. We further examine collectively managed gardens as urban commons that emerge as a form of resistance to the privatization of public urban space, and that offer opportunities to experiment with new models of urban lifestyles.

Advanced communication and transport technologies allow food sequestration from the farthest reaches of the planet, but have markedly increasing urban dependence on global food systems over the past 50 years. Simultaneously, such advances have eroded collective memory of food production, while suitable spaces for urban gardening have been lost. These factors combine to heighten the potential for food shortages when—as occurred in the 20th century—major economic, political or environmental crises sever supply lines to urban areas. This paper considers how to govern urban areas sustainably in order to ensure food security in times of crisis by: evincing the effectiveness of urban gardening during crises; showing how allotment gardens serve as conduits for transmitting collective social-ecological memories of food production; and, discussing roles and strategies of urban environmental movements for protecting urban green space. Urban gardening and urban social movements can build local ecological and social response capacity against major collapses in urban food supplies. Hence, they should be incorporated as central elements of sustainable urban development. Urban governance for resilience should be historically informed about major food crises and allow for redundant food production solutions as a response to uncertain futures",,food production;food supply;garden city;governance approach;greenspace;transportation technology;urban atmosphere,,,SAGE Publications Ltd,00420980,,,,English,Urban Stud,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84925639103,3,South Africa;Sweden;United States,Sweden,stockholm resilience centre;national center for ecological analysis and synthesis;stockholm resilience center;african centre for cities,stockholm resilience centre,advanced communication;advances;allotment;allotment garden;areas;article;article examines;build;capacity;central element;century—major;collapses;collective;collective memory;collective socialecological;combine;communication;conduits;considers;crises;crisis;crisis sever;crisis—open;crisis—open green;critical element;dependence;development;effectiveness;elements;environmental crisis;environmental movement;examines;factor combine;factors;farthest;food;food crisis;food production;food security;food sequestration;food shortage;food supply;food system;futures;garden serve;gardening;gardens;global food;govern;governance;green space;grow;heighten;hence;historical collapse;identifies;lines;local ecological;major collapse;major food;memories;memory;movements;order;paper;paper considers;past;planet;played;processes;production;production solution;protect;reaches;redundant;redundant food;resilience;response;response capacity;role;roles;security;sequestration;serve;sever;sever supply;shortage when—as;shortages;social movement;social process;social response;socialecological memory;solutions;space;spaces;strategies;suitable space;supplies;supply;supply line;systems;technologies;technology allow;times;transport;transport technology;uncertain future;urban area;urban dependence;urban development;urban food;urban garden;urban gardening;urban governance;when—as;year;years,cities;environmental movement;food;gardens;green space;lens;movements;resilience;resilience lens;space,447

Recent studies on food and the city have neglected this aspect of early modem food provisioning. By looking at individual households and the corporation of the gardeners' guild, this article glimpses the strategies of urban market gardeners. At first sight, urban farming could be considered a rather marginal phenomenon. Eighteenth-century records mention only a few farmers within the city walls, but this study suggests a more widespread phenomenon. Members of the gardeners' guild had a retail function rather than a role in the production of food. Guild members living within the walls were particularly active in retailing. Those who lived outside the walls were mostly producers. The gardeners' guild organized and controlled the influx of food, mostly fruit, vegetables, and to a lesser extent grain, but by no means had a monopoly on local food production. Urban farming, however, was not limited to the gardeners' guild. Probate inventories show a broad variety of households active in agriculture, without being members of the guild.

Being in its earliest stages, assessments of this effort must be made cautiously, even tentatively. Examining a movement that is in progress requires a study of the state's land use and segregation policies, both of which have been dynamic in Kentucky. Further, this study is also relevant as there is a growing convergence of national and regional attitudes towards American obesity, while there are competing notions of food preference and food choice. All of which are influenced by racial politics, and there is a deep concern regarding food security. Considering all of these, it is necessary to examine the Government's efforts to address obesity/food imbalance in a variety of settings, especially where urban farming is expanding, such as Chicago and Detroit. In New York, roof-top gardens dot the landscape and the urban farm movement is largely a “success”. So, city leaders have chosen to address another health issue – trans fat. Rather than joining the food choice/preference debate by banning fast-food restaurants, city leaders have chosen to enact a trans-fat ban. Unpopular at first, other cities and states have followed, and the Federal Government will mandate a trans-fat ban this year. In Louisville, Chicago and Detroit, where the trans-fat bans did not succeed, the urban farm movement may be the primary means of addressing malnutrition, in the form of obesity",food security;obesity;racial segregation;trans fat;urban farming,,"Hashim, N.; Jindal School of International Affairs, Jindal Global UniversityIndia",,Routledge,13549839,,,,English,Local Environ,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84933178298,1,India,India,jindal school of international affairs,jindal school of international affairs,address;address obesityfood;american obesity;assessments;attitude towards;attitudes;ban;bans;chicago;choice;choicepreference;choicepreference debate;chosen;cities;city;city leader;concern;convergence;debate;deep;deep concern;detroit;dot;effort;efforts;enact;examine;farm;farm movement;fastfood;fastfood restaurant;fat;federal government;food;food choice;food choicepreference;food preference;food security;form;garden dot;gardens;good start;government;government effort;governments;health;health issue;imbalance;issue;issue –;kentucky;land;land use;landscape;leaders;louisville;malnutrition;mandate;means;movement;new york;notions;obesity;obesityfood;obesityfood imbalance;policies;politics;preference;primary;primary mean;progress;racial politics;regional attitude;relevant;restaurants;rooftop;security;segregation;segregation policy;settings;stages;start;state land;states;study;towards;trans;transfat;transfat ban;urban farm;urban farming;use;variety;year;york;–;“success”,chicago;desertification;detroit;food;food desertification;louisville;urban farming,450

Moreover, cities have to become or remain livable for their inhabitants and offer social and economic opportunities. Thus, reconnecting food production and cities offers promising potential. The diffusion of urban farming reflects a rising awareness of how food and farming can shape our cities. A growing number of urban farming projects exist in and on urban buildings, including open rooftop farms, rooftop greenhouses and indoor farming. These projects are characterized by the non-use of land or acreage for farming activities. We use the term 'Zero-Acreage Farming' (ZFarming) to represent these farms. The objective of this paper is to: (1) illustrate and systemize present practices of ZFarming and (2) discuss specific novelties of ZFarming in the wider context of urban agriculture. We analyzed 73 ZFarms in cities of North America, Asia, Australia and Europe using a set of criteria, and developed a typology of ZFarming, complemented by in-depth interviews with pioneers in rooftop farming in New York. The results illustrate that ZFarming generates innovative practices that may contribute to a sustainable urban agriculture. Besides growing food, it produces a range of non-food and non-market goods. It involves new opportunities for resource efficiency, new farming technologies, specific implementation processes and networks, new patterns of food supply and new urban spaces",building integrated;indoor farming;rooftop farming;rooftop greenhouse;sustainability;urban farming;urban innovation;zero-acreage farming,,"Thomaier, S.; Technische Universitat Berlin, Department for Urban and Regional EconomicsGermany",,Cambridge University Press,17421705,,,,English,Renew Agric Food Syst,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84922018949,7,Germany,Germany,technische universitat berlin;institute of socio-economics;inter 3 institute for resource management;freie universitat berlin,technische universitat berlin,acreage;activities;agriculture;america;asia;australia;awareness;become;buildings;challenge;change;cities;city offer;climate;climate change;context;contribute;criteria;developed;diffusion;discus;discus specific;discuss;economic opportunity;efficiency;europe;exist;farming activity;farming project;farms;food;food production;food supply;footprints;future;future city;generates;global trend;goods;greenhouses;illustrate;implementation;implementation process;indepth;indepth interview;indoor;indoor farming;inhabitants;innovative practice;interviews;involves;land;major challenge;moreover;networks;new farming;new opportunity;new pattern;new york;nonfood;nonmarket;nonuse;north;north america;novelties;number;objective;offer;offer promising;offers;open rooftop;opportunities;paper;patterns;pioneers;practices;present;present practice;processes;produces;production;projects;promising;range;remain;represent;resource;resource efficiency;resource scarcity;result illustrate;results;rooftop;rooftop farm;rooftop farming;rooftop greenhouse;scarcity;set;shape;spaces;specific implementation;specific novelty;supply;technologies;term;term zeroacreage;trends;typology;urban agriculture;urban building;urban farming;urban footprint;urban space;use;wider;wider context;york;zeroacreage;zeroacreage farming;zfarms,building present;buildings;novelties;practice;present;present practice;specific novelty;urban building;zeroacreage;zeroacreage farming,451

This paper investigates in how far NeuLand is typical for a new form of political engagement 2.0, focused on local problems at people's doorstep rather than global critiques of political systems, which finds its expression in direct actions typical for the networked society, e.g. “green flash mobs.” Its potential to provide a blueprint for imagining and enacting alternative futures and new ways for citizens to claim their “right to the city” is being assessed. NeuLand provides an experiment with new forms of (urban) commons and possibly a (re)turn to the “liveable city” to replace the current neoliberal ideal of the “entrepreneurial city” [Harvey, D., 1989. From manageralism to entrepreneuralism: the transformation of urban governance in late capitalism. Geografiska Annaler, Series B, Human Geography, 71 (1), 3–17], developing new solutions to problems of urban management and city development that extend beyond the voluntary engagement of citizens within the logic of the neoliberal “big society.” Extending the scope beyond the analysis of urban gardening projects as examples of sustainable food production, or as vehicles for fostering community cohesion, integration or social capital, the NeuLand experiment is linked to wider debates of alternative and more sustainable socio-ecological futures than those currently practised in the newly “neoliberalizing cities” of Germany",activism;commons;neoliberal city;right to the city;urban gardening,entrepreneur;garden;governance approach;neoliberalism;urban development;voluntary approach;cologne;germany;north rhine-westphalia,"Follmann, A.; Institute of Geography, University of Cologne, Albertus-Magnus-Platz, Germany",,Routledge,13549839,,,,English,Local Environ,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84941188252,2,United Kingdom;Germany,Germany,institute of geography;london east research institute,institute of geography,actions;alternative;alternative future;analysis;annaler;b;blueprint;brownfield;brownfield site;capital;capitalism;cities”;citizens;city;city development;city”;city” harvey;claim;clay”;cohesion;cologne;commons;community;community cohesion;community garden;critiques;d;debates;development;direct action;doorstep;e;engagement;entrepreneuralism;examples;experiment;expression;extend;finds;flash;flash mob;food;food production;form;forms;futures;g;garden;gardening;gardening project;geografiska;geografiska annaler;geography;germany;global critique;governance;green garden;harvey;human;human geography;ideal;integration;investigates;land;late capitalism;local problem;logic;management;manageralism;march;mobs;neoliberal ideal;neoliberal “big;networked;neuland;neuland experiment;new form;new land;new solution;new way;paper;paper investigates;peoples;political engagement;political system;problems;production;projects;provide;red clay”;return;scope;series;series b;site;social capital;society;socioecological future;solutions;sustainable food;systems;transformation;urban gardening;urban governance;urban management;vehicles;voluntary engagement;ways;wider;wider debate;“a;“a green;“big;“big society;“entrepreneurial city”;“green;“green flash;“liveable city”;“right;”,clay;cologne;form;garden;gardening;germany;green garden;political gardening;red clay,452

Although there are many outstanding examples of urban farms in California, in general, urban agriculture (UA) has been slower to gain momentum here than in some other states with large urban populations. Over the past several years, urban agriculture's popularity in California has begun to escalate, with strong emerging interest in San Francisco, San Jose, Oakland, San Diego, Los Angeles and other metropolitan communities. One challenge for urban farmers and municipal decision makers engaged with UA in California has been limited availability of relevant information and technical assistance. A new project team at the University of California Cooperative Extension, part of the Division of Agriculture and Natural Resources (UC ANR) is working to develop web-based educational resources that will be grounded in a needs assessment that is currently underway. The needs assessment includes a literature review, an internal survey of UC ANR personnel, and community clientele interviews. This paper will report on preliminary findings and analyses of the needs assessment, particularly how UC ANR personnel are engaged with UA, and what tools they think would best serve urban farmers. We suggest implications for those involved with UA, such as personnel of land-grant universities, local governments and non-profits seeking to address the needs of urban farmers in an environment of constrained resources",community food systems;community gardens;community supported agriculture programs;farmers;food policy councils;markets;urban agriculture;urban farming;urban planning,farming system;food market;food policy;metropolitan area;smallholder;urban agriculture;urban planning;california;united states,"Surls, R.; UC Cooperative Extension, Los Angeles CountyUnited States",,Cambridge University Press,17421705,,,,English,Renew Agric Food Syst,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84921990425,7,United States,United States,agricultural sustainability institute;department of human ecology;department of agricultural and resource economics;department of environmental design,agricultural sustainability institute,address;agriculture;agriculture popularity;agriculture ua;agricultures;analyses;angeles;anr;anr personnel;assessment;assistance;availability;california;california cooperative;census;challenge;clientele;communities;community;community clientele;cooperative;cooperative extension;decision;decision maker;diego;division;educational resource;environment;escalate;examples;extension;farmers;farms;findings;francisco;gain;gain momentum;governments;implications;information;interest;internal survey;interviews;jose;landgrant;landgrant university;limited availability;literature;literature review;local government;los;los angeles;makers;metropolitan;momentum;municipal decision;nation;natural resource;need assessment;needs;new project;nonprofits;oakland;outstanding example;paper;part;past;personnel;popularity;populations;preliminary finding;project;project team;relevant;relevant information;report;resource uc;resources;review;san;san diego;san francisco;serve;serve urban;several year;state;state census;states;suggest;survey;team;technical assistance;think;tools;ua;uc;uc anr;united state;universities;university;urban agriculture;urban farm;urban farmer;urban population;urban state;years,assessment;california;california preliminary;need assessment;needs;preliminary result;results;support;support urban;urban farming,455

However, large portions of the city and metropolitan region do have open land and a history of agricultural production in the not-too-distant past. Local food movements and concerns about food security have sparked a growing interest in urban farming. Policies in other sectors to address diet-related illnesses, environmental quality and climate change may also provide opportunities to expand urban farming. Nevertheless, for any major advances in urban agriculture, significant changes in local and regional land use policies are needed. These do not appear to be forthcoming any time soon unless food movements amplify their voices in local and national food policy.

The unique factors that influence urban agriculture, including limited and non-traditional land access, use of reclaimed soils and alternative growing mediums, local legal and political environments, social and community-based missions, and involvement of non-traditional farmers, create a production system distinct from rural agricultural enterprises. In many cases, specific local environmental and external factors drive urban farms to develop unique innovations for space-intensive production systems, often creating a dominant paradigm for urban farming for a given location. Furthermore, non-production-related organizational goals are often the primary focus of urban agricultural operations, with the food production becoming a secondary objective. In order to address this information gap regarding the status of urban agriculture in the US, our project, centered at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, gathered data through site visits to and interviews of organizations in seven cities, examining how structural and strategic food system factors shape urban agricultural efforts. A broad range of operations are considered, including diverse business and production models based on both commercial and community-based management strategies and production in parking and vacant lots, warehouses, public land and peri-urban locations. Based on these observations, the unique innovations in space-intensive agricultural production that have arisen in response to urban food system factors are discussed.

Where the findings of individual studies are used to justify a design approach, there are often difficulties encountered because of different context of the original study. Through our understanding and synthesis of multiple studies, we propose a set of design patterns. The proposed patterns can be utilised concurrently depending on the scale and context of both the physical garden and community. The relationships between the patterns and their concurrent use are discussed, and the resulting links provided the foundation for a pattern language. The eight initial patterns provide a foundation on which we would encourage other researchers to contribute, in order to develop a pattern language to holistically consider UA beyond the scope of our experiences in Brisbane and to enrich the patterns with a variety of gardening practices",design patterns;food;gardening;interaction design;pattern language;urban agriculture;urban informatics,,"Lyle, P.; Urban Informatics Research Lab, Queensland University of TechnologyAustralia; email: p.lyle@qut.edu.au",,Springer Singapore,,9789812879196; 9789812879172,,,English,"Citiz Right to the Digital City: Urban Interfaces, Activism, and Placemaking",Book Chapter,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85008953565,3,Australia,Australia,queensland university of technology,queensland university of technology,agriculture;agriculture ua;approach;backyard;balcony;brisbane;city;city farm;communities;community;community garden;concurrent;concurrent use;context;contribute;design;design approach;design pattern;different context;different type;difficulties;encourage;enrich;experiences;farms;findings;forms;foundation;garden;gardeners;gardening;gardening practice;gardens;grass;grass root;group;individual study;individuals;initial pattern;justify;language;links;local community;many form;multiple;multiple study;order;original study;pattern;pattern language;pattern provide;patterns;physical garden;practices;present;propose;provide;relationships;researchers;residential gardeners;root group;roots;scale;scope;set;spaces;studies;study;supports;synthesis;types;ua;ua city;urban agriculture;urban space;use;variety,design;design pattern;gardening;patterns;urban gardening,459

Design/Methodology/Approach: Peri-urban landscapes are important as they supply fresh fruit, vegetables, turf, ornamental plants and other farm products to the cities. In this study, the Hawkesbury–Nepean Catchment (HNC) was used as a case study and a number of farmers were selected to examine how they use the available technologies for irrigation scheduling to make better decisions for developing water management strategies on their farms. The farmers who participated in the study were mainly growing fruit, turf, vegetables, pasture, olive trees and cut flowers. Findings: It was observed that a range of factors influenced correct irrigation scheduling decisions of farmers, including their limited understanding of the soil-water-plant relationship, costs of implementing soil-moisture monitoring technology and finding a date for irrigation activity that is compatible with their other farm tasks. It was also found that the farmers’ experiential knowledge played an important role in their irrigation scheduling decisions. The study indicated that irrigation scheduling approaches, which have a low labour requirement and are cost effective and easy to use would be helpful to farmers. Practical Implications: The study highlighted that there are some irrigation management issues for research and extension that are specific to peri-urban farming and as such they need to be addressed to improve irrigation management and to cope with future water scarcity in urban and peri-urban landscapes. Originality/Value: This is one of few studies that examine irrigation scheduling issues in a peri-urban context. The study has revealed that irrigation scheduling in reality cannot be an exact science, but it needs to accommodate various farmer constraints in field situations and may have implication for extension activities in peri-urban and other regions",irrigation extension;irrigation management;irrigation scheduling tools;peri-urban farming;water conservation,,"Maheshwari, B.L.; School of Science & Health, University of Western Sydney, Locked Bag 1797, Australia",,Routledge,1389224X,,,,English,J Agric Educ Ext,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84930923759,2,Australia,Australia,school of science & health;nsw department of primary industries,school of science & health,abstract;abstract purpose;accommodate;activities;activity;aim;approaches;article;available technology;cannot;case;case study;catchment;catchment hnc;cities;constraints;context;cope;correct;correct irrigation;cost;costs;cut;cut flower;date;decisions;designmethodologyapproach;designmethodologyapproach periurban;developments;exact;exact science;examine;examine irrigation;examine key;experiential knowledge;extension;extension activity;extension development;factors;farm;farm product;farm task;farmer;farmer constraint;farmers;farmers’;farmers’ experiential;farms;field;field situation;findings;flowers;found;fresh fruit;fruit;future;future research;future water;hawkesbury–nepean;hawkesbury–nepean catchment;helpful;hnc;implication;implications;important role;irrigation;irrigation activity;irrigation management;issues;key;key irrigation;knowledge;labour;landscapes;limited understanding;low labour;management;management issue;management strategy;monitoring;monitoring technology;need;needs;number;olive tree;originalityvalue;ornamental;ornamental plant;pasture;periurban;periurban context;periurban farming;periurban landscape;plants;played;practical implication;products;purpose;range;reality;reality cannot;regions;relationship;requirement;research;role;scarcity;science;situations;soilmoisture;soilmoisture monitoring;soilwaterplant;soilwaterplant relationship;strategies;studies;study;supply;tasks;technologies;technology;trees;turf;use;various farmer;vegetables;water;water management;water scarcity,australia;catchment;experiences;extension;hawkesbury–nepean;hawkesbury–nepean catchment;insights;irrigation;irrigation management;landscape –;landscapes;management;periurban;periurban landscape;practice;practice irrigation;–;– experience,460

Aquaponics, as a closed loop system consisting of hydroponics and aquaculture elements, could contribute to addressing these problems. However, there is a lack of quantitative research to support the development of economically feasible aquaponics systems. Although many studies have addressed some scientific aspects, there has been limited focus on commercial implementation. In this review paper, opportunities that have the potential to fill the gap between research and implementation of commercial aquaponic systems have been identified. The analysis shows that aquaponics is capable of being an important driver for the development of integrated food production systems.

Yet, the system is criticised for its negative effects, like increasing food miles, monocultures, a lack of transparency and poor animal welfare. The recent trend to farm more food in an around cities (urban and peri-urban farming) seems to provide an alternative to the existing system. Urban and peri-urban agriculture (UPA) comes with many potential benefits, from reducing food miles and improving local urban climate to supporting social coherence in local neighbourhoods and improving personal health. At the same time, the field of UPA is very diverse and not each project addresses each of the potential benefits. This paper addresses urban livestock farming as a specific form of UPA. ""Livestock farming"" is hereby defined as raising domesticated animals, such as cattle, pork, poultry or fish for the production of food. Each of these types of farming has different needs and implications when included in the city. This study specifically looks into pig farming in an urban setting. It states that design-based-research is a useful research strategy to explore the possibilities and probabilities of this type of UPA. It draws on the design-based study 'City Pig', conducted at The Why Factory (2009), Delft University of Technology. The results of this study can be evaluated in order to get a grip on the possible benefits of this specific type of urban livestock farming. An important limitation is that it concerns virtual, un-built design proposals. As built, productive examples of UPA are still scarce in the Netherlands and beyond this design-based-research method could fill a gap and help gathering knowledge for future project. Therefore, this paper not only evaluates of a specific type of UPA, but also tests on whether research-by-design studies, can form a useful tool to further develop UPA in general. The aim of this paper is therefore two-fold: What are the potential benefits of urban pig farming and how can un-built design projects help to answer that question for future 'real' projec",design-based research;food production;food system;green washing;urban agriculture;urban farming,,"Hackauf, U.",,TU Delft,18750192,,,,English,Res Urban Ser,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84964655284,1,,,,,address urban;addresses;agriculture;agriculture upa;aim;alternative;animal;animal welfare;animals;answer;benefits;built;cattle;centuries;cities;city;city pig;city urban;climate;coherence;concerns;delft;delft university;design;design project;design proposal;designbasedresearch;designbasedresearch method;different need;diverse;draws;effects;evaluates;examples;explore;factory;farm;field;fill;fish;food;food mile;food system;form;future;future project;gap;gathering;gathering knowledge;global food;global population;grip;health;help;help gathering;hereby;implications;important limitation;knowledge;lack;last century;limitation;livestock;livestock farming;local neighbourhood;local urban;looks;many potential;method;miles;monocultures;needs;negative effect;neighbourhoods;netherlands;order;paper;paper address;periurban;periurban agriculture;periurban farming;personal health;pig;pig farming;poor animal;population;pork;possibilities;possible benefit;potential benefit;poultry;probabilities;production;productive example;projec;project;project address;project help;projects;proposals;provide;question;real projec;recent trend;research;research strategy;researchbydesign;researchbydesign study;results;scarce;social coherence;specific form;specific type;states;strategy;studies;study;study city;system;technology;tests;time;tool;transparency;trend;twofold;type;types;unbuilt design;university;upa;upa come;urban climate;urban livestock;urban pig;urban setting;useful research;useful tool;welfare,city;city pig;farm;livestock;livestock farming;pig;pig farm;research;urban livestock,462

We explore the action research intervention with a focus on the role of spatial interventions in fostering social innovation in the public food and land agenda. We structure our discussion in a threefold conceptual framework: (i) a discussion on shifting planning arenas and their understanding in social innovation; (ii) an overview of the role of political gardening practices, in particular of food commons/food sovereignty initiatives, in envisioning and implementing alternative urbanism and (iii) a discussion on the action research nexus, through a thick case study description in which we also unpack our own engagement and positionality. Doing so, we aim to contribute to the creation of an active memory of political gardening.

In the past, allotment gardens played an important role in cities' food self-sufficiency, however they are often omitted from the current food production debate. In the Czech Republic, as well as other Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries, food selfprovisioning is still widespread. Traditional practices, often burdened with rather negative connotations from the socialist era, are nowadays interacting with the efforts of the local food movement and urban gardening trends rediscovered in Western Europe. Based on research from allotment gardens at Kravihora, Brno, this paper investigates the socio-economic and environmental facets of the selfprovisioning of fruits and vegetables within this specific context and its relation to alternative food networks, reflecting on Smith and Jehlicka's notion of ""quiet sustainability"". The different uses of allotments are described, as are the functions and needs they fulfil. Using the method of consumer diaries, the presented research aims to quantify the amount of fruits and vegetables produced at Kravihora. Furthermore, gardeners' motivations and their level of environmental consciousness are outlined. The respondents' declared relationship towards nature is contrasted with their respective attitudes and behaviour patterns towards the natural environment. The conclusion is that allotment gardens not only improve the urban environment and provide space for community building in cities, but they also offer significant potential for food provisioning, which can be supported within the framework of alternative food networks and urban sustainabili",allotment gardens;alternative food networks;food self-provisioning;quiet sustainability;urban agriculture,,"Sovova, L.; Department of Environmental Studies, Faculty of Social Studies, Masaryk University in BrnoCzech Republic; email: es_lucie@centrum.cz",,Masaryk University,1214813X,,,,English,Soc Stud,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84957056132,1,Czechia,Czechia,department of environmental studies,department of environmental studies,aims;allotment;allotment garden;allotments;alternative;alternative food;amount;attention;attitudes;behaviour;behaviour pattern;brno;building;cee;cee country;cities;city food;community;community building;conclusion;connotations;consciousness;consumer;consumer diary;context;contribute;countries;critique;current food;czech;czech republic;debate;described;diaries;efforts;environment;environmental consciousness;environmental facet;era;europe;european cee;facets;food;food movement;food network;food production;food provisioning;food selfsufficiency;food system;framework;fruits;fulfil;functions;gardener motivation;gardeners;gardening;gardens;important role;investigates;jehlickas;jehlickas notion;kravihora;last year;level;local food;method;motivations;movement;natural environment;nature;needs;negative connotation;networks;notion;nowadays;offer;paper;paper investigates;paper seek;past;pattern towards;patterns;played;practices;practitioners;production;production debate;provide;quiet sustainability;relation;relationship;relationship towards;republic;research;research aim;respective;respective attitude;respondents;role;scholars;seeks;selfsufficiency;significant potential;smith;socialist;socialist era;space;specific context;sustainabili;sustainability;system;topic;towards;traditional practices;trends;urban environment;urban gardening;urban sustainabili;uses;vegetables;western europe;years,allotment;allotment garden;brno;brno allotment;consciousness;environmental consciousness;gardens;sustainability,466

These facilities are especially useful for urban farming where high efficiency in small spaces is required. In this study, we investigated whether light emitting diode (LED) lights with mixed dominant wavelengths (650 nm : 550 nm : 445 nm=8:1:1, 650 nm : 445 nm=6:4) can increase the growth rate and bio-active compound content of carrots in comparison to that of fluorescent light (FL). LED with mixed wavelength (650 nm : 550 nm : 445 nm=8:1:1) increased the total weight and root circumference of carrots compared to FL. However, β-carotene contents were not significant in LED (650 nm : 550 nm : 445 nm=8:1:1). However, LED (650 nm : 445 nm=6:4) increased the β-carotene (FL: 7.27, LED: 10.48 mg/g β-carotene dried weight).

A possible solution for local authorities could therefore be to promote rooftop gardening. However little technical information exists on certain forms of rooftop urban agriculture, called Z-Farming. In 2012, a pilot experiment was run in Paris (France). Simple and cheap systems of rooftop gardening were tested on a rooftop using as crop substrates only local urban organic waste so as to contribute to the urban metabolism. Production levels and heavy metal contents in cropping substrates and edible vegetables were measured. Available results show (i) high levels of crop production with limited inputs compared to land professional gardening, (ii) low levels of heavy metal pollutants in the edible parts of the crops, especially for Cd and Pb with respect to EU norms for vegetables and (iii) positive influence on yields on organizing the substrate in layers and enhancing the biological activity through earthworm inoculation. These encouraging results allow us to consider that rooftop gardening is feasible and seem to have a great potential to improve urban resiliency.

In particular, Seoul, the capital city of Korea, is affected by seasonal winds from northwest China, named the Asian dust wind, which contains various heavy metals and probably causes heavy metal deposition on plants growing in rooftop gardens in Seoul. Growing media and plants from 18 rooftop gardens distributed throughout Seoul were examined in this study to determine the magnitude of heavy metal (cadmium (Cd), copper (Cu), chromium (Cr), nickel (Ni), lead (Pb) and zinc (Zn)) exposure in the urban agricultural environment. The heavy metal levels in all of the growing media examined were below the Korean standard limits of soil, although the Cu and Zn levels were elevated due to excessive use of livestock-based composts. Heavy metal concentrations in plants were also comparable with the natural levels. Compared to unwashed plants, washing reduces the hazard quotient of heavy metals by 17–28%. This was due to deposition of airborne dust on the plant surface. Cu, Pb and Zn deposited on the plant surface were attributed to the urban environment such as industrial activities and traffic, while Cr and Ni were attributed to the Asian dust wind carrying the corresponding heavy metals from China to the northwest of Seoul",asian dust;hazard assessment;heavy metal;urban farming;urban soil,,"Kim, K.-H.; Department of Environmental Horticulture, University of Seoul, 163 Siripdaero, South Korea",,Taylor and Francis Ltd.,00380768,,SSPNA,,English,Soil Sci Plant Nutr,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84937642640,5,South Korea,South Korea,department of environmental horticulture;department of agronomy & medicinal plant resources,department of environmental horticulture,abstract;abstract plant;activities;agricultural environment;airborne dust;areas;asian dust;cadmium;cadmium cd;capital;capital city;cause heavy;causes;cd;china;chromium;chromium cr;city;composts;concentrations;contains;copper;copper cu;cr;cu;deposition;determine;dust;dust wind;environment;excessive use;exposure;gardens;grown;hazard;hazard quotient;heavy metal;industrial activity;korea;korean;korean standard;lead;lead pb;levels;limits;magnitude;media;metal;metal cadmium;metal concentration;metal deposition;metal level;metals;natural level;ni;nickel;nickel ni;pb;plant;plant grown;plant surface;plants;quotient;reduces;rooftop;seasonal wind;seoul;soil;standard;standard limit;study;surface;traffic;unwashed plant;urban area;urban environment;use;wind;winds;zinc;zinc zn;zn;zn exposure,airborne dust;concentrations;crop;crop plant;dust;garden;influence;metal;metal concentration;plants;rooftop;seoul,470

This change, alongside a changing climate, will strain Earth's resources, especially the food supply chain. One idea that has been proposed to address this issue is vertical farming - the urban farming of fruits, vegetables, and grains, inside a building in a city or urban centre, in which floors are designed to accommodate certain crops. While an interesting theoretical concept, no studies currently exist that quantify or qualify the validity of such an idea. The purpose of this paper, therefore, is to examine the feasibility and plausibility of the vertical farming concept from a socio technical, mixed methods, research perspective. This includes (1) examining how much energy is needed to power such a building and whether renewable energy can meet the onsite demands of the building by constructing a energy model, (2) quantifying the carbon footprint of vertically grown produce and subsequently comparing that to conventionally grown produce, and (3) conducting interviews to explore how relevant stakeholders perceive the concept of vertical farming in order to identify what are current barriers and opportunities exist towards possible uptake of the technology. The findings indicate that vertical farming is a tool that can be used to supply food to cities in a sustainable manner, but this depends on the location and design.

Sixty-seven residents participated in focus groups related to environmental health, food security, and urban gardening. In addition, soils from six locations were tested. Residents expressed interest in the development of urban gardens to improve access to healthy, fresh produce, but they had concerns about soil quality. Soils were contaminated with lead (Pb), zinc, cadmium (Cd), and copper, but not arsenic or chromium. Results from our study suggest paint was the main source of soil contamination. Detectable polyaromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) levels in urban soils were well below levels of concern. These urban soils will require further management to reduce Pb and possibly Cd bioavailability to decrease the potential for uptake into food crops. Although the number of locations in this study is limited, results suggest lower levels of soil contaminants at well-established gardens. Soil tillage associated with longterm gardening could have diluted the soil metal contaminants by mixing the contaminants with clean soil. Also, lower PAH levels in long-term gardening could be due to enhanced microbial activity and PAH degradation, dilution, or both due to mixing, similar to metals. No foodborne pathogen targets were detected by PCR from any of the soils. Residents expressed the need for clearness regarding soil quality and gardening practices in their neighborhoods to consume food grown in these urban areas. Results from this study suggest long-term gardening has the potential to reduce soil contaminants and their potential threat to food quality and human health and to improve access to fresh produce in low-income urban communities.

Whether urban agriculture can play a significant role in feeding the world's population, however, is unclear. In particular, the literature provides little guidance on how much food could be produced in Western cities. This research addresses some of this gap by presenting the results of a survey conducted with 50 backyard gardeners that explored how much food they produced and what these gardens used in terms of land, labour and capital. Data comes from Guelph ON, a mid-sized Canadian city west of Toronto, and was collected over the 2012 gardening season. Results indicate that home vegetable gardeners produced an average of 1.43kg of fruit and/or vegetable per m2 gardened. This means that the value of these garden products would be worth $4.58USD/kg if bought in a grocery store. When these data were extrapolated up to the city level, results show that self-provisioning could produce approximately 200,000kg of food - enough to feed 2900 people. When labour is valued at minimum wage, producing this food required $35.86USD/kg of inputs. When labour is not valued, this dropped to $10.82USD/kg. There are wide variations in the data; the productivity of the most and least productive gardens varied by nearly 2 orders of magnitude (the range was 0.08-5.18kg/m2 and 0.3h/kg and 21.9h/kg). Three key conclusions stand out: (1) there is impressive potential when only the most productive are considered as an illustration of what could be produced; (2) as it is currently practiced, only a fraction of potential production is happening; and (3) for urban self-provisioning to meet its potential, a major increase in the area gardened and gardening skill is required",garden efficiency;gardening;self-provisioning;urban agricultural yields;urban agriculture;urban food security,data set;empirical analysis;food production;garden;sustainability;urban agriculture;canada;ontario [canada];toronto,"CoDyre, M.; Department of Geography, University of GuelphCanada",,Elsevier GmbH,16188667,,,,English,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84940166422,3,Canada,Canada,department of geography;school of environmental design and rural development,department of geography,addresses;agriculture;andor;andor vegetable;area;backyard;backyard gardener;bought;canadian;canadian city;capital;cities;city;city level;city west;conclusion stand;conclusions;data;feed;feed people;food;food enough;food system;fraction;fruit;fruit andor;gap;garden;garden product;gardeners;gardening;gardening season;gardening skill;gardens;grocery;grocery store;guelph;guidance;home;home vegetable;illustration;important part;impressive potential;increase;indicate;inputs;key;key conclusion;labour;land;level;literature;little guidance;m2;magnitude;major increase;means;meet;minimum;minimum wage;much food;order;orders;part;people;play;population;potential production;produce;production;productive garden;productivity;products;range;research;research address;result indicate;result show;results;role;season;show;significant role;skill;stand;store;survey;sustainable food;system;terms;toronto;urban agriculture;urban selfprovisioning;value;variations;varied;vegetable;vegetable gardener;wage;west;western city;wide variation;world population;worlds;worth,costs;empirical evaluation;evaluation;garden;garden grow;gardening;grow;urban gardening,473

A common constraint is not being able to grow directly in the soil, making raised-bed gardening a necessity. Subirrigated planters (SIPs) are a style of raised bed with a subsoil reservoir that provides aeration and allows growers to irrigate below the soil where water is pulled up via capillary action. This bed design has vocal advocates; anecdotally, growers find them to be high yielding, water efficient and easier to maintain than standard raised beds. Given their apparent promise, there is interest in promoting SIPs and in utilizing them in larger-scale urban gardening operations but no rigorous tests compare these beds relative to standard raised beds. At one location and for one season, we compared yields for three crops: cayenne pepper (Capsicum annuum), sungold cherry tomatoes (Solanum lycopersicum) and lacinato kale (Brassica oleracea), crop quality and labor input for two styles of SIPs, as well as a sack garden, a variation of a SIP that does not require lightweight soil, with two conventional raised beds (one with a compost and topsoil mix and one with the soilless growing medium ideal for container gardening). Results from our first year of data indicate that both the SIP beds and the conventional beds with the soilless growing medium were more productive overall than conventional raised beds with topsoil and compost (P<0.01). Tomato production in the SIP without the root barrier was greater than both the conventional bed with the compost and topsoil mix (P<0.01) and the conventional bed with the soilless growing medium (P<0.05). The majority of the higher-cost beds had a positive revenue stream in the first summer season; given these results, investing in SIPs or in soil appropriate for raised beds appears to be worth the higher initial cost",raised-bed design;subirrigated planters;urban agriculture;yield advantage,brassica oleracea;capsicum annuum;lycopersicon esculentum;lycopersicon esculentum var. cerasiforme,"Sullivan, C.; Feedback FarmsUnited States",,Cambridge University Press,17421705,,,,English,Renew Agric Food Syst,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84922058912,4,United States,United States,agriculture and food security center,agriculture and food security center,action;advocates;aeration;agricultural production;agriculture;allows;annuum;apparent;apparent promise;appropriate;barrier;bed;bed design;bed relative;beds;biophysical constraint;brassica;brassica oleracea;capillary;capillary action;capsicum;capsicum annuum;cayenne;cherry;cherry tomato;common constraint;compare;compost;compost p0;constraint;constraints;container;container gardening;context;conventional bed;cost;crop;crop cayenne;crop quality;crops;data;design;efficient;first year;garden;gardening;gardening operation;grow;growers;guidance;high yielding;highercost;highercost bed;ideal;indicate;initial cost;input;interest;irrigate;kale;kale brassica;labor;labor input;lacinato;lacinato kale;landscape;largerscale;lightweight;lightweight soil;location;lycopersicum;maintain;majority;medium;medium ideal;medium p0;mix;mix p0;necessity;oleracea;operations;p0;pepper;pepper capsicum;planter sip;planters;positive revenue;production;productive overall;promise;quality;raisedbed;relative;require;require lightweight;reservoir;results;revenue;revenue stream;rigorous test;root;root barrier;sack;sack garden;season;set;shortage;sip;sip bed;sips;soil;soil appropriate;soilless;solanum;solanum lycopersicum;standard;stream;style;styles;subsoil;subsoil reservoir;summer;summer season;sungold;sungold cherry;test compare;tests;tomato;tomato production;tomato solanum;tomatoes;topsoil;topsoil mix;unique;unique set;urban gardening;urban landscape;usa;variation;vocal advocate;water;water efficient;worth;year;yields,agriculture;evaluation;evidence;planters;urban agriculture,474

For this purpose, spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.) was grown in containers with soilless media supplemented with organic and inorganic nutritional sources. The experiment was laid out in a complete randomized design with four replications. Seven growing media were assessed: peat moss, peat moss combined with 150, 200 and 250 ppm ammonium nitrate (NH<inf>4</inf>NO<inf>3</inf>), and peat moss amended with compost having nitrogen equivalent to the mentioned NH<inf>4</inf>NO<inf>3</inf> concentrations. Scheduled and quantified irrigation was provided with a sprinkler system to conserve water and minimize emission into the environment. Salt accumulation and pH of media was monitored throughout growing period. Spinach leaves were analyzed for total soluble solids, titratable acidity, ripening index, total nitrogen, total organic carbon, carbon to nitrogen ratio, fresh biomass, dry biomass, dry matter (mg g-1 fresh biomass), leaf moisture contents, nitrate content, colorimetric traits (lightness, chromacity and hue angle), ascorbic acid, total flavonols and anthocyanins and antioxidant capacity. Among all media, combinations of peat moss with NH<inf>4</inf>NO<inf>3</inf> resulted in less nitrate, more organic carbon and dry matter (mg g-1 fresh biomass), higher total soluble solid contents and ripening index of the plants.

The latter are fundamental resources for the emergence of collective action; however, the highly individualized structure of contemporary society makes the creation of social ties ever the more difficult. As a consequence, contemporary waves of protest are often short-lived. Nonetheless, in response to the multidimensional crises, the consolidation of grassroots mutualistic and cooperative experiences, within which new affiliations for collective action are experienced, is on the rise. Indeed, it is a fact that even though conditions are not favorable, social movements have continued to expand and promote community-led initiatives for social and economic sustainability. In some cases, these initiatives play a decisive role in the fight against poverty and in guaranteeing human livelihood. Solidarity-based exchanges and networks, such as barter groups, urban gardening, new consumer-producer networks and cooperatives, time banks, local savings groups, urban squatting, and others similar experiences are typical examples of continuous reactivation of people's desire to be agents of their own destiny. This combination of formal and informal networks are a testimony to an ability and an aspiration. Indeed, on one hand, they are indicative of citizens' capacity to self-organize in order to tolerate, absorb, cope with and adjust to the environmental and social threats posed by neoliberal policies. On the other hand, they are attempting to change an economic system, increasingly perceived as unfair and ecological disruptive, by building an alternative in the cracks of the former, based on greater mutual solidarity between individuals and more sustainable connections with the environment. This special issue is a reflection, among the many that have being proposed of late, on some of these self-organized collective actions that have pass through and/or emerged from the aftermath of the crisis. It is the result of an attempt to cross various disciplinary fields, in order to explore the redundancy of their respective explanations as to why and how some grassroots activities last and succeed, and turn this redundancy into the powerhouse for relaunching more robust and less aleatory initiatives",collective action;commons;degrowth;resilience;sustainable community movement organizations (scmos),,"D'Alisa, G.; Institute of Envornmental Sceince and Technology, Autonomous University of BarcelonaSpain; email: giacomo_dalisa@yahoo.it",,University of Salento,19727623,,,,English,Partecip Confl,Editorial,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84959043180,3,Italy;Spain,Spain,institute of envornmental sceince and technology;university of bergamo,institute of envornmental sceince and technology,ability;absorb;action;actions;activities;adjust;affiliations;aftermath;agents;aleatory;aleatory initiative;alternative;andor;aspiration;attempt;banks;barter;barter group;bonds;building;capacity;cases;challenges;change;citizen capacity;citizens;collective;collective action;combination;conditions;connections;consequence;consolidation;consumerproducer;consumerproducer network;contemporary society;contemporary wave;continuous reactivation;cooperation;cooperative;cooperative experience;cooperatives;cope;cracks;creation;crises;crisis;cross;decisive;decisive role;demands;desire;destiny;difficulties;disciplinary field;disruptive;ecological disruptive;economic crisis;economic sustainability;economic system;emergence;environment;examples;exchanges;expand;experiences;explanations;explore;face;fact;fields;fight;fundamental resource;gardening;grassroots;groups;hand;human;human livelihood;individualized structure;individuals;informal network;initiative play;initiatives;institutions;issue;latter;le aleatory;livelihood;local saving;movement face;movements;multidimensional;multidimensional crisis;mutual solidarity;neoliberal policy;networks;new affiliation;new consumerproducer;new socioeconomic;order;others;pass;people;peoples;play;policies;poverty;powerhouse;promote;propensity;protest;reactivation;redundancy;reflection;resources;respective;respective explanation;response;result;rise;robust;role;savings;similar experience;social movement;social threat;social tie;society;socioeconomic demand;solidarity;solidaritybased exchange;special issue;structure;sustainability;sustainable connection;system;testimony;threats;ties;time;time banks;tolerate;turn;types;typical example;unfair;urban gardening;urban squatting;waves,actions;activism;collective;collective action;crisis;crisis mapping;economic activism;grassroots;mapping;redundancy;times,476

Low soil fertility is a major contributing factor to the current vicious cycle of low agricultural productivity and inadequate livelihoods among smallholder farmers. Integrated soil fertility management (ISFM) is one way of achieving sustainable agricultural development, but improving soil fertility through ISFM requires interventions that match the behavioural inclinations of farmers and their decision making. Using survey data on 125 commercial peri-urban farmers growing kale (Brassica oleracea) around Nairobi, Kenya, this study examined two conceptual approaches for measuring ISFM attitudes. A Rasch model, where the odds ratio for engaging in an ISFM practice is given by the difference between farmers' attitude and the difficulty of the practice in terms of behavioural cost, identified ISFM attitudes as a unidimensional concept. However, assessing attitudes based on a standard valence method raised problems of construct validity. Accounting for behavioural costs as determinants of ISFM, in addition to other pecuniary costs, may improve our understanding of how farmers deal with complex choices in the ISFM context. Our findings suggest that high behavioural costs in relation to use of human faeces as manure, use of crop residues and transport impede adoption of ISFM practices vital to increased productivity. These findings can be used to develop ISFM communications and improve the efficacy of different interventions intended to increase potential uptake of ISFM practices",behavioural cost;peri-urban farming;rasch model;sub-saharan african country;valence,agricultural development;alternative agriculture;cost analysis;cultivar;decision making;farmers attitude;fertilizer application;food security;leafy vegetable;manure;numerical model;periurban area;productivity;smallholder;soil fertility;agricultural production;communication network;conceptual framework;crop residue;integrated approach;soil management;technology adoption;kenya;nairobi [kenya];sub-saharan africa;brassica oleracea,"Lagerkvist, C.J.; Department of Economics, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, P.O.

However, the literature lacks an understanding of whether urban farming has extended beyond a compelling concept into the practice of farming in the city and peri-urban areas. The exact definition of an urban farm is challenging, since many urban farms have a primary mission of supporting social goals rather than providing food. Use of the USDA definition of farm omits many self-identified urban farms, but the most consistent measure of agriculture is the Census of Agriculture. Using census data, this paper finds that urban farms are smaller than the typical farm, and while the amount of urban and peri-urban farmland declined between 2002 and 2007, the total number of farms increased. Growth in farmland is positively related to land values, suggesting that increases in urban farmland are more likely to take place in population dense, land scarce areas. Spatial analysis of urban and peri-urban farms in the Northeast finds fewer clusters of farms in areas with high land costs. In the most populous Northeastern cities, the farms are more likely to be located in the peri-urban area than in the urban core. Urban farms in the Northeast were more likely to produce vegetables, eggs and goats. Significant levels of vegetable farm clusters were detected surrounding Providence, Boston and Hartford Metropolitan Statistical Areas, which are regions that had no significant level of clustering of total farms. Future analysis, incorporating data from the 2012 census, should provide insight into whether local policy changes have resulted in growth in urban farms and farmland",census of agriculture;farm clustering;peri-urban agriculture;spatial analysis;urban agriculture,agricultural land;census;metropolitan area;periurban area;policy reform;spatial analysis;urban agriculture;boston;connecticut;hartford;massachusetts;united states;capra hircus,"Dimitri, C.; Department of Nutrition, Food Studies and Public Health, New York UniversityUnited States",,Cambridge University Press,17421705,,,,English,Renew Agric Food Syst,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84921962404,2,United States,United States,department of nutrition,department of nutrition,agriculture;amount;analysis;area;areas;boston;bring;building;census;census data;changes;cities;city;clusters;community;community building;compelling;compelling concept;concept;consistent;consistent measure;core;costs;current trend;data;definition;dense;eggs;exact;exact definition;farm;farm cluster;farm omits;farmland;farms;finds;food;food security;food waste;future;future analysis;goals;goats;green space;growth;hartford;hartford metropolitan;high land;increases;insight;lacks;land;land cost;land scarce;land value;level;levels;literature;literature lack;local policy;many u;measure;metropolitan;metropolitan statistical;mission;northeast;northeastern city;number;omits;open green;paper;paper find;periurban;periurban area;periurban farm;periurban farmland;place;policy;policy change;population;population dense;practice;primary;primary mission;produce;produce vegetable;property;property value;provide;providence;reduction;regions;scarce;scarce area;security;significant level;social goal;space;spatial analysis;statistical area;total farm;total number;trend;typical farm;u city;urban agriculture;urban core;urban farm;urban farming;urban farmland;usda;usda definition;use;values;vegetable;vegetable farm;vegetables;waste,agriculture;areas;census;highlights;periurban;periurban area;state highlight;states;united state,478

Urban gardens are important anthropogenic habitats but it is unknown whether, when and why spillover of beneficial insects occurs between gardens and agricultural habitats. We used trap nests for Hymenoptera to monthly monitor bee and wasp abundance and species richness in 12 gardens and 12 rapeseed fields. Half of the gardens and rapeseed fields were located in the urban–rural interface and bordered each other (a garden paired with a rapeseed field) and the other half were isolated in the rural landscape (isolated rapeseed fields) and in the urban city centre (isolated gardens). In general, gardens in the urban–rural interface comprised the highest richness of bees and wasps. The abundance of bees but not of wasps was highest in paired habitats and peaked at full rapeseed blooming, indicating that mass-flowering rapeseed offers foraging resources for bees nesting in adjacent gardens. Thus, bees nest and increase their populations in both areas, benefiting from the mass-flowering resource in the agricultural habitat as well as the nesting resources from gardens, suggesting spillover of bees but not of wasps between paired gardens and rapeseed fields. Our study highlights the value of gardens in the urban–rural interface for the biodiversity of functionally important insects.

Indeed agricultural areas have a great potential in terms of urban re-generation, fostering a city’s resilience and its energy efficiency, even in the perspective of climate change hazards. Further agricultural areas are also crucial for social opportunities and new job creation in the perspective of integrating both ecological and urban services in the framework of more competitive (and attractive) cities. According to the MEA definition of ecosystem services as constituents of well-being (MAE, 2005), this paper presents a case study that addresses the following questions: Can we consider the urban agricultural areas as an ecological infrastructure for the city? And, if affirmative, can we manage it in a more integrated way? The study is structured as a research case study and focuses on a former agricultural area in the city centre of Naples, Italy. This is an almost three hectares area on the hill of San Martino featured by being an important city’s landmark. Despite the abandonment of crops, the agricultural land use is still typical of the hill and it represents a core potential to provide ecological and urban services for the city.

The influence of socioeconomics and location-specific factors on urban gardening patterns merits continued study. Using Beijing Municipal Province in China, a rapidly urbanizing region, as a case study, we address two questions: 1) How do biodiversity patterns change between different urbanized regions in Beijing? 2) How do ecosystem services provided by Beijing home gardens change with socioeconomic status and location-based preferences of gardeners? We surveyed 104 home gardens in Beijing Municipal Province for plant biodiversity, abundance, and species ecosystem services (ES) (provisioning or cultural uses). The gardens were distributed across three urbanized regions (suburban, peri-urban, and exurban). We found that species biodiversity and abundance shift according to a hierarchy of need from ornamentals (cultural ES) to edibles (provisioning ES) with increasing distance from Beijing. These trends are related to reduced income, lowered food security, and lack of urban markets in exurban regions. Rarefaction curves indicate ornamental species drive β diversity. Ordination also showed a shift in species composition with increasing isolation from the city; Suburban and exurban gardens were the most different, while peri-urban gardens were similar to both others. Only exurban gardens had a positive relationship between species and area. High edible cover and high species density indicates that demand for edibles in exurban regions may be higher than space constraints allows. Our study better quantifies species biodiversity patterns in Beijing, and can inform urban planners about the value and usefulness of home garden space",agriculture;biodiversity;ecosystem services;food security;socioeconomics;species-area relationship,,"Clarke, L.W.; Department of Botany and Plant Sciences, University of California Riverside, 2150 Batchelor Hall, United States",,Springer New York LLC,10838155,,,,English,Urban Ecosyst,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84895911531,4,United States;China,United States,department of botany and plant sciences;college of agricultural resources and environmental sciences,department of botany and plant sciences,abundance;abundance shift;address;agricultural biodiversity;allows;area;beijing;beijing home;beijing municipal;biodiversity;biodiversity pattern;case;case study;change;china;city;composition;constraint allows;constraints;cover;cultural e;curve indicate;curves;demand;density;density indicates;distance;diversity;drive;drive β;ecosystem;ecosystem service;edible cover;edible provisioning;edibles;es;exurban;exurban garden;exurban region;factors;food;food security;found;garden;garden change;garden space;gardeners;gardening;gardening pattern;gardens;hierarchy;high edible;high specie;home;home garden;income;indicate;indicate ornamental;indicates;influence;inform;inform urban;isolation;lack;locationspecific;locationspecific factor;markets;merits;municipal province;need;ordination;ornamental;ornamental specie;ornamentals;others;pattern change;pattern merit;patterns;periurban;periurban garden;planners;plant;plant biodiversity;positive relationship;preferences;province;quantifies;question;questions;rarefaction;rarefaction curve;reduced income;region;region suburban;regions;relationship;repositories;security;service e;services;shift;socioeconomic status;socioeconomics;space;space constraint;specie biodiversity;specie composition;specie density;specie ecosystem;species;status;study;suburban;trends;urban gardening;urban market;urban planner;urbanized region;urbanizing region;usefulness;uses;value;world;β,beijing;beijing municipality;biodiversity;china;drivers;ecosystem;ecosystem service;gardens;home;home garden;municipality;plant;plant biodiversity;production;service;service production,484

Urban sustainability has become the key concept around which such activities are organized. Official sustainability plans are most often implemented through indicators and metrics. In Minneapolis, Minnesota, urban gardening, in a variety of forms, has been the focus of ongoing citizen- and NGO-led environmental efforts, as well as municipal measures of sustainability. Here, debates around the recent adoption of a city urban agriculture policy, as well as a program to encourage the installation of raingardens in neighborhoods across the city, reveal some of the rich variations in gardening practices and spaces. These far exceed the relatively narrow official focus on sustainability indicators.

We revealed significant differences in trace metal content depending on species, fruit type, local traffic, and parameters related to barriers between the sampling site and neighbouring roads. Higher overall traffic burden and proximity to roads increased whereas buildings or vegetation as barriers reduced trace metal content in the edible biomass.

Interest in local food production on this land has the potential to dramatically reshape the composition of greenspace found within urban landscapes. This study examined how the conversion of vacant land to urban gardens and farms influenced arthropod generalist predator populations and their ability to support biocontrol services. We found that the abundance of Coccinellidae and Syrphidae, and the activity density of Carabidae, Formicidae, and Lycosidae were equivalent among vacant lot and urban garden sites. Dolichopodidae abundance and the activity density of Linyphiidae and Opiliones were reduced in urban gardens whereas Anthocoridae abundance and the activity density of Staphylinidae were greater within urban gardens relative to vacant lots. The biocontrol service supplied by generalist predators was measured using sentinel eggs (Helicoverpa zea (Noctuiidae)) and pupae (Sarcophaga bullata (Sarcophagidae) and Musca domestica (Muscidae)). We found no difference in the biocontrol of H. zea eggs or M. domestica pupae among the focal greenspaces. We found no difference in the removal of S. bullata pupae by predators in June 2010, whereas in August 2010 a greater proportion of pupae were removed in urban garden sites relative to vacant lots.

As urban and peri-urban farming is both an opportunity to improve the livelihood for small-scale farmers and a potential public health hazard, studies are warranted to reveal possible peculiarities in the epidemiology of brucellosis in this type of dairy farming. In total, 904 cows of breeding age belonging to 443 herds in 32 villages were serologically tested with indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and positive samples confirmed with competitive ELISA. Two logistic regression models were used to investigate an association between seropositivity and risk factors at herd and individual level. The herd and individual seroprevalences were 4.1 and 2.0 %, respectively. Herds with a history of abortions were found to be associated with seropositivity [odds ratio (OR) = 5.3; 95 % confidence interval (CI), 1.3-21.3]. Large herds with more than eight cattle were more likely to be seropositive compared to smaller herds with one to two cattle (OR = 13.9; 95 % CI, 1.6-119). The number of calves produced per cow (indicating age) was found to be associated with seropositivity. Younger cows with one to two produced calves were less likely to be seropositive compared to older cows with more than six produced calves (OR = 0.24; 95 % CI, 0.06-1.0).

However, as examples from many countries around the world show, they are neither temporary nor unstable. It is the goal of this presentation to address aspects of the long-standing struggle to include such gardens as an integral part of urban land-use planning. This struggle includes the need for effective communication via contemporary media to give kleingaerten and comparable gardens a permanent status in land-use planning. The need to organize democratically at the level of the residential neighborhood as well as at municipal, regional, national and international levels will be emphasized. The Pniowers social program to provide a city of 1 million inhabitants with gardens will be discussed as a prime example of the role of urban horticulture as part of a city-wide open-space policy.

While industrialization of the cities is still low, tertiarization of the economy has gradually replaced the traditional major occupation of farming. However, since the end of the 1990s a new trend has emerged in which urban residents seek complementary employment in relatively small agricultural activities within and around the urban centres. Economic necessity, scarce urban land resources and the large urban market associated with increasing urbanization have, among other factors, encouraged investment in horticulture. Horticulture is being practiced on residential plots, within neighborhoods and on the flood plains, but the attention of this study has focused on the flood plains at the peripheral areas of Minna, the capital of Niger State. These plains are found everywhere around the city and make both dry season and rainy season horticultural activities possible. The objectives of the study were to examine the flood plains as a resource for urban farming, to assess the livelihood activities associated with urban horticultural practices, to explore how the Niger State agricultural policy affects urban agriculture, to evaluate threats to urban agriculture as well as adaptation to these threats, and to make recommendations for sustainable urban horticulture practice in Niger",food market;land resources;livelihood;opportunities;threats;urban,,"Sanusi, Y.A.; Department of Urban and Regional Planning, Federal University of Technology, Minna, Nigeria; email: grandspace@yahoo.com",,International Society for Horticultural Science,05677572,9789462610088,,,English,Acta Hortic,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84899670008,1,Nigeria,Nigeria,department of urban and regional planning,department of urban and regional planning,activities;adaptation;affect urban;affects;agricultural activity;agricultural centre;agricultural policy;agriculture;areas;assess;attention;base;capital;centres;cities;city;colonialism;complementary;complementary employment;developed;dry;dry season;economic base;economic necessity;economy;employment;end;evaluate;evaluate threat;examine;explore;factors;flood;flood plain;found;horticultural activity;horticultural practice;horticulture;horticulture practice;industrialization;investment;land;land resource;livelihood;livelihood activity;major occupation;market;minna;necessity;neighborhoods;new trend;niger;niger state;nigeria;objectives;occupation;peripheral area;plains;plots;policy;policy affect;practice;practices;precolonial;precolonial urban;rainy;rainy season;recommendations;resident seek;residential plot;residents;resource;resources;scarce;scarce urban;season;season horticultural;seek;seek complementary;state;study;tertiarization;threats;trend;urban agriculture;urban centre;urban farming;urban horticultural;urban horticulture;urban land;urban market;urban resident;urbanization;years,analysis;case;case study;horticulture;livelihood;livelihood opportunity;minna;niger;niger state;nigeria;opportunities;periurban;periurban horticulture;state;study,491

The Allada Plateau is a well-known rural area that produces fruits and vegetables for the major cities in Benin. However, the increasing pressure from human settlement is a real threat for farming activities in this region. In order to understand the phenomenon of spatio-temporal dynamics of land occupation, map projections for the following years are presented: 1959, 1972, 1992 and 2006. A rapid diagnosis of plot ownership by group makes it possible to clearly see how land is currently being utilized. Basic ownership and water usage units remained stable. Declining ecosystem units are rain and semi-evergreen rain forests and palm oil crop rotation; increasing units are crops, fallow land, industrial plantation of teak, palm oil, fruit trees and built-up areas. A new form of peri urban farming activities representing 13.61% of the total area is emerging. In the context of new land ownership, tree planting stabilizes the land, raises money and provides shade. Natural resource consumers, urbanization and preservation and/or protection of natural resources are not necessarily in conflict.

At the same time, critical social scientists increasingly argue that urban agriculture programmes, by filling the void left by the ""rolling back"" of the social safety net, underwrite neoliberalisation. I argue that such contradictions are central to urban agriculture. Drawing on existing literature and fieldwork in Oakland, CA, I explain how urban agriculture arises from a protective counter-movement, while at the same time entrenching the neoliberal organisation of contemporary urban political economies through its entanglement with multiple processes of neoliberalisation. By focusing on one function or the other, however, rather than understanding such contradictions as internal and inherent, we risk undermining urban agriculture's transformative potential.

On the basis of these findings, it is argued that current conceptualisations of political gardening are too limiting and do not account for the nuances of how politics shape, challenge and materialise in urban gardening activities.

In this paper I argue that the term ""urban"" poorly reflects the diversity of spatial references that underpin such projects. I explore the framing process of two competing agriculture and gardening projects in Geneva, Switzerland. I first show that the social and spatial frames of the projects, i.e. the central definition of a public and of a spatiality are inextricably linked. In the second part, I argue that by ranking the spatial units that ground the spatial frames of the projects according to the specific public they are aimed at, the most powerful actor makes competitive use of scale frames. This paper thus argues for more attention to the socio-spatial framing of urban agriculture and urban gardening projects. It contributes to the debate on the politics of scale by exploring how a scalar hierarchy is performed through the strategic deployment of spatial criteria by social actors.

However, little has been known about how such a provision takes place and what kind of participation can lead to the resilience of a community. This paper presents a field report which seeks to reveal the nature of participation in a social media-enabled urban farming community. Through an interpretive case study, the findings demonstrate interconnectedness of the community involving people, place, and technology. Three areas of contributions are outlined: a wider application of design framework for sustainable food culture, the role of social media for social participation through urban farms, and the route to building community resilience from social media-enabled participation.

Qualitative and mixed-methods approaches with GIS value the suite of spatial methods and technologies, while typically showing a marked sensitivity toward issues of subjectivity, knowledge production, exclusion, reflexivity, and power relations. Although recent research in the use of qualitative GIS demonstrates the ways in which spatial representations and analyses can be used as part of critical geographic inquiry, there remain significant opportunities to demonstrate and synthesize the particular affordances of these approaches. Alongside broader developments in public scholarship and the digital humanities, mixed-methods research with GIS is coming of age, as technological innovations are easing access to data and access to visualization and analytical tools for some. The implications of these developments at the level of knowledge construction within community-based, critical research have been underexplored, however. What are the specific affordances of mixed-methods research with GIS? How are mixed-methods knowledges made and worked through community engagement?

The former type of gardens have been a staple of various Zagreb locations for decades while the latter have been established only recently – in early 2013, or are still in the process of being established. Therefore, several research methods were used in the study. In addition to ethnographic fieldwork (conducted in the Jarun neighborhood, using observation of the gardens and semi-structured interviews with participants) and gathering additional information by consulting archival materials, particular attention was given to recent coverage of the phenomenon in the newspapers and on web portals devoted to ecology.Given that the research of urban gardening lies at the intersection of humanities and various social sciences such as the ethnology of everyday life, the anthropology of banality, urban sociology, human geography etc., this paper is based on a variety of theoretical perspectives, at the same time trying to offer a new framework for the treatment of this topic which has been arousing interest of the scholarly community and the general public alike. Hence the two-pronged approach, focusing on the various aspects of investment in urban gardens, and on the importance of exposure of gardens.

More than half of the world's population (currently 7 billion) will be living in urban areas by the year 2015. This phenomenal increase in the global population and its attendant urbanization exerts extreme pressures on the earth systems through human activities, which now cause significant negative effects on the global cycles and systems. Urban gardening trends and some aspects of urban and peri-urban agriculture have been shown to be sustainable with a yield potential of up to 50 kg of fresh produce per square meter per year. However, the rate by which land is lost to urbanization, erosion, deforestation and desertification, especially in developing countries, calls for sophisticated, diverse and efficient production systems, which produce not only high yields and profit on an environmentally sustainable basis, but also produce foods that are nutritious enough to meet global food security indices. Vegetable cowpea, Vigna unguiculata, cultigroup Sesquipedalis is a vegetable cowpea par excellence, producing long succulent and green edible pods that are up to 0.7 m long, fresh edible pods of up to 4.1 tons per hectare and, above all, matures early, producing edible pods within 34 days of planting. It also performs excellently across varying agro-ecological zones from humid tropics to the dry savannah, making it a potentially global vegetable. The adoption of this vegetable variety in urban gardening (house hold gardens, roof tops, balconies, alley ways, road sides, etc.) and its incorporation as part of the design and planning initiatives for sustainable modern urban cities will guarantee an uninterrupted protein source to urban and other families throughout the year either as fresh immature pods or as dry grains while also maintaining the integrity of the environment",climate change;environment;food security;planning;production;protein;sustainable;urban cities;vegetable cowpea,climate change;crop production;developing world;environmental protection;food security;legume;protein;sustainability;urban agriculture;urban area;urban development;urban planning;urbanization;vigna unguiculata,,,WITPress,17433541,9781845647629,,,English,WIT Trans Ecol Environ,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84903147035,2,Nigeria,Nigeria,department of agronomy;college of agriculture,department of agronomy,activities;adoption;agriculture;agroecological zone;alley;alley ways;areas;aspects;attendant;attendant urbanization;balconies;basis;calls;cause;cities;countries;cowpea;cowpea par;cultigroup;cultigroup sesquipedalis;cycles;day;days;deforestation;desertification;design;diverse;dry;dry grain;dry savannah;earth;earth system;edible pod;effects;efficient;efficient production;environment;erosion;etc;excellence;exerts;extreme;extreme pressure;families;food;food security;foods;fresh edible;fresh immature;fresh produce;gardening;gardening house;gardens;global cycle;global food;global population;global vegetable;grains;grow;guarantee;half;hectare;high yield;hold;house;house hold;human;human activity;humid;humid tropic;immature;immature pod;incorporation;increase;indices;initiatives;integrity;kg;land;living;long succulent;matures;meet;meter;modern urban;negative effect;par;par excellence;part;performs;periurban;periurban agriculture;phenomenal;phenomenal increase;planning;pods;population;pressures;produce;produce food;production;production system;profit;protein;protein source;rate;road;road sides;roof;roof tops;savannah;security;security index;sesquipedalis;sides;source;square;square meter;succulent;sustainable basis;systems;ton;tons;tops;trends;tropics;unguiculata;uninterrupted protein;urban area;urban city;urban gardening;urbanization;urbanization exerts;variety;vegetable;vegetable cowpea;vegetable variety;vigna;vigna unguiculata;ways;world;world population;worlds;year;yield;yield potential;yields;zones,cheap;cheap protein;cities;cowpea;crop;protein;source;urban city;vegetable;vegetable cowpea,505

The emergence of urban gardening movements in postindustrial cities necessitates accurate assessment of soil lead levels to ensure safe gardening. In this study, we examined small-scale spatial variability of soil lead within a 15 × 30 m urban garden plot established on two adjacent residential lots located in Detroit, Michigan, USA. Eighty samples collected using a variably spaced sampling grid were analyzed for total, fine fraction (less than 250 μm), and bioaccessible soil lead. Measured concentrations varied at sampling scales of 1-10 m and a hot spot exceeding 400 ppm total soil lead was identified in the northwest portion of the site. An interpolated map of total lead was treated as an exhaustive data set, and random sampling was simulated to generate Monte Carlo distributions and evaluate alternative sampling strategies intended to estimate the average soil lead concentration or detect hot spots. Increasing the number of individual samples decreases the probability of overlooking the hot spot (type II error). However, the practice of compositing and averaging samples decreased the probability of overestimating the mean concentration (type I error) at the expense of increasing the chance for type II error.

Grassroots as well as institution-led urban agricultural projects are currently mushrooming in the cities of the Global North, reshaping urban landscapes, experimenting with alternatives to the capitalist organization of urban life and sometimes establishing embryonic forms of recreating the Commons. While this renewed interest in land cultivation and food production is attracting increasing interest in a wide range of disciplines - from planning to landscape and cultural studies - it remains a very marginal and almost unexplored field of human geography. Nonetheless, beyond the rhetoric of sustainability and health, urban agriculture raises several relevant questions of interest for a critical geographer.

The resulting labour distribution patterns manifested itself in the type of crops men and women took responsibility for, the specific agricultural tasks they performed and the spatial segregation of men's and women's activities and tasks. Traditional gender-related labour boundaries were also challenged and reworked.

Heavily used nitrogen (N) fertilisers are converted to nitrates that can be a health hazard. In this study, water and N budgets over a 1-year period are presented for typical urban vegetable gardens in Lisbon. A conceptual analysis supported by an integrated methodology of field experiments and modelling identified the N surpluses associated with conventional and organic gardens. It is concluded that the gardening systems are continuously cropped using high N and water application rates. For all of the case-study allotments, the N inputs, mainly from organic amendments with diverse N release rates, were higher than the crop uptake generating surpluses that were lost by different processes. On one study site a drainage flux of 280mmyr-1 was calculated, with a mean concentration of 295mg NO3- l-1. On another site N accumulated in the lower soil depths at a rate of 420kg NO3-ha-1yr-1. The cumulative impact of N surpluses on the environment and human health must be considered. To minimise adverse impacts, we propose the selection of organic fertilisers with N release rates close to the crop N uptake, the prevention of excess irrigation to minimise N leaching and gaseous losses and the inclusion of the non-fertiliser N sources in the fertiliser calculations. It is shown how an integrated model can be used to predict the N release dynamics from the organic fertilisers as affected by the moisture conditions",c:n ratio;n leaching;rzwqm;soil n budget;soil water balance;urban gardens,crops;fertilizers;groundwater;health hazards;leaching;soils;c:n ratio;n-leaching;rzwqm;soil water balance;urban garden;budget control,"Cameira, M.R.; CEER - Biosystems Engineering, Superior Institute of Agronomy, University of Lisbon, Tapada da Ajuda, 1349-017 Lisbon, Portugal; email: roscameira@isa.ulisboa.pt",,Academic Press,15375110,,BEINB,,English,Biosyst Eng,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84904472475,3,Portugal,Portugal,superior institute of agronomy,superior institute of agronomy,adverse;adverse impact;agrochemicals;allotments;amendments;analysis;application;application rate;budgets;calculations;casestudy;casestudy allotment;concentration;conceptual analysis;concern;conditions;contamination;crop;crop n;crop uptake;cropped;cumulative impact;depths;different process;diverse;diverse n;drainage;drainage flux;dynamics;environment;excess;excess irrigation;experiments;fertiliser;fertiliser calculation;fertilisers;field;field experiment;flux;gardening;gardening system;gardens;gaseous loss;groundwater;groundwater contamination;hazard;health;health hazard;high n;human;human health;impact;impacts;inclusion;inputs;irrigation;l1;lisbon;losses;mean;mean concentration;methodology;minimise;minimise adverse;minimise n;model;moisture;moisture condition;n;n budget;n release;n surplus;nitrates;nitrogen;nitrogen n;no3;no3ha1yr1;nonfertiliser;organic amendment;organic fertiliser;organic garden;period;predict;prevention;processes;propose;public;public concern;rate;rate close;rates;release;release rate;selection;site;site n;soil;soil depth;sources;study;study site;surpluses;systems;typical urban;uptake;urban farming;urban vegetable;use;vegetable;vegetable garden;water;water application,budgets;different production;lisbon;lisbon urban;nitrogen;nitrogen budget;production;production system;systems;urban farming;water,509

Within the quantitative research - in form of a questionnaire based survey – we analyze the relationship between ""management system"" and intellectual capital. The data collected from this survey is analyzed using the statistical software SPSS. In a first phase, we elaborated the theoretical model underpinning the empirical research. Based on bibliographic research we have identified seven dimensions of the management system which may exert a significant influence on the generation and development of intellectual capital. Thus, a model which aims at establishing a relationship between the management’s dimensions and the three components of intellectual capital emerged. This model is useful for academia and researchers as well as for practitioners whose aim is to foster the development of intellectual capital using managerial tools. In the next part of the paper, based on the results of the quantitative research which establish a link between management dimensions and intellectual capital development, we analyzed the characteristics of the above management dimensions on the specific case of a successful social enterprise from the field of urban gardening which can be considered a best practice example",higher education institutions;human capital value;organizational learning;organizational performance;practices and tools,,"Agoston, S.I.; The Bucharest University of Economic StudiesRomania",,Editura Economica,18420206,,,,English,Manage Mark,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84924445900,1,Romania,Romania,the bucharest university of economic studies,the bucharest university of economic studies,academia;aim;aims;analysis;analysis relies;analyze;bibliographic research;capital;capital development;case;characteristics;components;creation;data;development;dimensions;empirical research;enterprise;enterprises;example;exert;field;form;foster;gardening;generation;influence;intellectual capital;link;management;management dimension;management system;management’s;management’s dimension;managerial;managerial pattern;managerial tool;model;next part;paper;paper aim;part;patterns;phase;practice;practice example;practitioners;present;present paper;qualitative;qualitative study;quantitative;quantitative research;questionnaire;relationship;relies;research;researchers;results;significant influence;social enterprise;software;software spss;specific case;spss;statistical software;study;survey;survey –;system;theoretical model;tools;urban gardening;–,capital;enterprises;intellectual capital;social enterprise,511

While the improvements to vacant or underutilized land are lauded, the practice of community gardening is underpinned by the assumption that it is a temporary practice on temporarily-available land. This assumption, which is at times implicit and at others explicit, maintains that support for community gardens-technical assistance and especially access to land-can be temporary. Through a genealogy of community garden advocacy in the U.S., we find that a dominant narrative of community gardening as a means to an end has been continuously reproduced for more than a century in large part by government agencies and philanthropic organizations. In recent decades, community gardeners have become key actors in advocacy, and although they portray gardening as a meaningful part of everyday city life, they also reproduce that narrative of temporariness by promoting it as a means to address various issues. We argue that this tension between means and ends-especially coming from community gardeners-is problematic. It is a challenge for community gardeners and the many other producers of green space on supposedly vacant land because their means-oriented discourse takes precedence in the public imagination; it perpetuates the notion that the land is ultimately still vacant",community gardens;discourse;genealogy;urban gardening;urban space,advocacy;garden city;genealogy;greenspace;local participation;public space;urban area;united states,"Drake, L.; Rutgers University, Department of Geography and Department of Landscape Architecture, 54 Joyce Kilmer Ave., Piscataway, NJ 08904, United States; email: lpdrake@eden.rutgers.edu",,Elsevier Ltd,02642751,,,,English,Cities,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84901825980,2,United States,United States,rutgers university;rutgers university,rutgers university,access;actors;address;advocacy;agencies;argue;assistance;assumption;attention;become;become key;benefits;century;challenge;city;city life;community;community garden;community gardener;community gardenersis;community gardening;decades;discourse;dominant;end;everyday;everyday city;examples;explicit;garden;garden advocacy;gardeners;gardenersis;gardenersis problematic;gardening;gardens;gardenstechnical assistance;genealogy;government;government agency;green space;imagination;implicit;improvements;issues;key;key actor;land;large part;life;maintains;many example;meaningful;meaningful part;means;notion;organizations;others;outcomes;part;perpetuates;philanthropic;philanthropic organization;portray;portray gardening;practice;precedence;producers;public;public imagination;range;recent decade;recent year;reproduce;s;space;support;temporarilyavailable land;temporariness;temporary practice;tension;time implicit;times;transformations;u;underutilized land;vacant;vacant land;various issue;years,community;community garden;gardens;lands;relationship;s;u;vacancy;vacant;vacant land;verdancy,514

The most common component of anthropogenic greenspace is the ornamental lawn. Intensively managed and offering limited habitat opportunities for both plants and insects, lawns are biodiversity poor and ecologically insensitive. An alternative lawn format that positively influences biodiversity and reduces management requirements would be a useful tool in eco-friendly urban greenspace management. In investigating the potential for a forb-only alternative to the grass lawn we sampled both trial grassfree lawn formats and turf lawns to identify any influence that lawn composition and grass-free lawn specific mowing regimes might have on the abundance and diversity of insect families. In addition to the mowing regimes, both the composition and origin of lawn flora were found to significantly influence insect abundance and diversity and these factors rarely interacted. Native-only and mixed origin grass-free lawns hosted greater numbers of adult insects than found in turf and an equivalent diversity of insect families, however the mowing regime applied was distinct from traditional turf lawn management by being substantially less intensive and our results suggest that there is the potential for even greater abundance and diversity via the grass-free format that may offer additional resources to insectivorous garden species such as birds. When the composition of grass-free lawns included native forbs the diversity of insect families was found be sufficiently different from turf lawns to form distinct assemblages and in so doing contribute to beta diversity within urban greenspace. In sum, grass-free lawns may be a useful and aesthetically appropriate tool for adding value to the generally biodiversity poor urban lawnscape",arthropods;created vegetation;novel ecosystems;urban biodiversity;urban gardening,abundance;anthropogenic effect;biodiversity;greenspace;habitat conservation;habitat type;insect;insectivore;mowing;native species;species diversity;urban area;urban planning;arthropoda;aves;hexapoda;vertebrata,"Smith, L.S.; School of Biological Sciences, University of Reading, Whiteknights, United Kingdom",,Kluwer Academic Publishers,09603115,,BONSE,,English,Biodiversity Conserv,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85027939075,4,United Kingdom,United Kingdom,school of biological sciences,school of biological sciences,abundance;addition;additional resource;adult;adult insect;alternative;alternative lawn;anthropogenic;anthropogenic greenspace;appropriate;appropriate tool;areas;assemblages;beta;beta diversity;biodiversity;birds;common component;component;composition;contribute;distinct;distinct assemblage;diversity;equivalent;equivalent diversity;factors;families;flora;forbs;form;form distinct;format;formats;found;garden;garden specie;grass;grass lawn;grassfree;grassfree format;grassfree lawn;greenspace;greenspace management;habitat;habitat opportunity;habitats;indigenous habitat;influence;influence biodiversity;influence insect;influences;insect;insect abundance;insect diversity;insect family;insectivorous garden;insects;lawn;lawn composition;lawn flora;lawn format;lawn management;lawn specific;lawns;lawnscape;limited habitat;management;management requirement;mixed origin;mowing regime;native forbs;numbers;offer;offering;opportunities;origin;origin grassfree;ornamental;ornamental lawn;plants;reduces;regime;regimes;requirements;resources;result suggest;results;species;suggest;sum;tool;traditional turf;trial;trial grassfree;turf;turf lawn;urban greenspace;urban lawnscape;useful tool;value;vertebrates,abundance;diversity;ecological value;grassfree;grassfree lawn;insect;insect abundance;lawns;lawnscape;urban lawnscape;value,515

There is a lack of knowledge on the influence of plant exposure conditions on human bioaccessibility of metals, which is of particular concern with the increase in urban gardening activities. Lettuce, radish, and parsley were exposed to metal-rich ultrafine particles from a recycling factory via field atmospheric fallouts or polluted soil. Total lead (Pb) and cadmium (Cd) concentrations in of the edible plant parts and their human bioaccessibility were measured, and Pb translocation through the plants was studied using Pb isotopic analysis. The Pb and Cd bioaccessibility measured for consumed parts of the different polluted plants was significantly higher for root exposure (70% for Pb and 89% for Cd in lettuce) in comparison to foliar exposure (40% for Pb and 69% for Cd in lettuce). The difference in metal bioaccessibility could be linked to the metal compartmentalization and speciation changes in relation to exposure conditions. Metal nature strongly influences the measured bioaccessibility: Cd presents higher bioaccessibility in comparison to Pb. In the case of foliar exposure, a significant translocation of Pb from leaves toward the roots was observed. To conclude, the type of pollutant and the method of exposure significantly influences the phytoavailability and human bioaccessibility of metals, especially in relation to the contrasting phenomena involved in the rhizosphere and phyllosphere. The conditions of plant exposure must therefore be taken into account for environmental and health risk assessment",,atmospheric pollution;exposed to;human bioaccessibility;lead and cadmiums;phytoavailability;ultrafine particle;cadmium;lead;air pollution;article;bioaccumulation;contaminated plant;controlled study;edible plant;environmental exposure;fallout;health hazard;human;lettuce;parsley;phytoavailability;plant leaf;radish;rhizosphere;risk assessment;soil pollution;vegetable,"Dumat, C.; Universite´ de Toulouse, INP-ENSAT, Av. de l'Agrobiopoˆle, France",,ASA/CSSA/SSSA,00472425,,JEVQA,,English,J Environ Qual,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84907053841,6,France;Pakistan,France,universite´ de toulouse;ecolab (laboratoire d'e´cologie fonctionnelle);ademe (french agency for environment and energy management);comsats institute of information technology,universite´ de toulouse,account;accumulate;accumulate metal;activities;airborne particle;analysis;assessment;atmospheric fallout;bioaccessibility;bioaccessibility cd;cadmium;cadmium cd;case;cd;cd bioaccessibility;cd concentration;cd present;changes;comparison;compartmentalization;concentrations;concern;conclude;conditions;difference;edible plant;edible portion;exposure;exposure condition;factory;fallouts;field;field atmospheric;foliar;foliar exposure;foliar transfer;gardening;gardening activity;health;health risk;human;human bioaccessibility;increase;influence;influences;isotopic;isotopic analysis;knowledge;lack;lead;lead pb;leaves;lettuce;metal;metal bioaccessibility;metal compartmentalization;metal nature;metalrich;metalrich ultrafine;metals;method;nature;parsley;particles;particular concern;parts;pb;pb isotopic;pb translocation;phenomena;phytoavailability;plant;plant exposure;plant part;plants;pollutant;portions;presents;radish;relation;risk;risk assessment;root;root exposure;roots;significant translocation;soil;speciation;speciation change;total lead;transfer;translocation;type;ultrafine;ultrafine particle;urban gardening,atmospheric pollution;bioaccessibility;cadmium;cadmium phytoavailability;human;human bioaccessibility;lead;particles;phytoavailability;pollution;process;process ultrafine;soil;ultrafine;ultrafine particle;vegetables,516

To examine the possible health hazards of heavy metals in local population, quantification of accumulation potential and daily intake values of heavy metals in two commonly grown vegetables of Pakistan; okra (Abelmoschus esculentus) and brinjal (Solanum melongena) was assessed. Three major sites of Multan were selected: Kot Abdul Fateh, Hamroot and Mozu Alamgir, irrigated by waste, tubewell and underground water respectively. Total 30 soil samples, 30 irrigation water samples and 60 vegetables samples were analysed. All samples of irrigation water, soil and vegetables were contaminated with heavy metals (Ni, Cd, Cu, Pb, Mn and Co). Out of contaminated, all irrigation water samples exceeded their maximum residual limits (MRLs) except Cu and Co while for soil only Cd exceeded its MRL. Documentation of accumulated heavy metals in vegetables suggests that the concentration of lead and cadmium in both vegetables is higher than their respective MRLs. However, the daily intake values of these metals in both children and adults were below their recommended values according FAO/WHO.

These changing landscapes are fashioned from the discursive relationship between nature and culture, but at times are represented as predominately either natural or cultural areas, perpetuating a nature culture dualism. The values of various resident sociocultural groups are thought to mirror the separation of nature and culture, although other literature argues these groups are much more complex and interwoven in their values and practices. This paper explores a case study of landholders involved in weed management in southeast Queensland and supports the case that the groups are much more aligned in values and practice than is often represented in discourse, or as thought of by institutional practitioners. We argue that some institutions have employed a 'separatist gaze', dividing and stereotyping these actors, and aligning their services to one or other group through the compartmentalisation of their institutional functions.

We can design low-carbon landscapes for terrestrial (e.g. forests and urban farming areas) as well as aquatic (e.g. urban streams, ponds, and wetlands) urban spaces. Ecological interactions between water and soil in an urban ecosystem cause high carbon accumulation rates, especially in waterfront areas. Furthermore, heat absorption at waterfronts also significantly mitigates urban heat island effect. Therefore, urban open spaces with waterfronts are ecologically vital and may help us cope with climate change. However, the design and application of urban low-carbon landscapes are still in the conceptual phase and the creation a low carbon city remains as a preliminary draft. At present, there are very few studies measuring carbon emissions and carbon absorptions in the urban area. Moreover, studies that analyze low-carbon landscape components and their social effects are needed. In this study, we propose a novel conceptual definition of low-carbon landscape and investigate the research methods related to low-carbon landscape design.

However, planners increasingly see 'decline' as a development state to anticipate and a development strategy to consider. For example, a place may lose population while continuing to provide a high quality of life and social value. Vacant land is central to planning issues related to decline: some currently-occupied housing may likely become abandoned and demolished, yielding vacant lots, while some currently vacant lots may be inputs to alternative uses such as recreational space, urban farming or commercial uses. In this paper, we develop decision models that enable planners to generate a range of neighborhood-level development strategies that jointly optimize multiple objectives related to residential satisfaction, scale economies in development and equity. We apply these models to a case study of a small city. Model solutions may help planners understand how alternative model formulations are associated with spatial variation in active versus passive land uses, values of important output measures such as residential satisfaction, and the special role that vacant land plays in regional development policies that can be classified as smart growth or smart decline",decision models;municipal shrinkage;urban planning;vacancy management,land management;policy analysis;policy development;residential satisfaction;urban area;urban development;urban planning;urban policy;united states,"Johnson, M.P.; Department of Public Policy and Public Affairs, University of Massachusetts BostonUnited States; email: michael.johnson@umb.edu",,Elsevier Ltd,02642751,,,,English,Cities,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84901834778,3,United States,United States,department of public policy and public affairs;department of urban and environmental policy and planning,department of public policy and public affairs,active versus;activity;alternative;alternative model;anticipate;areas;become;case;case study;cities;city;decision;decision model;decline;development;development policy;development state;development strategy;economic activity;economies;enable planner;equity;example;formulations;generate;growth;growth rate;help;help planner;high quality;housing;housing stock;important output;increases;inputs;issues;land;land play;levels;life;likely become;lose population;lots;measures;model;model formulation;model solution;models;multiple;multiple objective;neighborhoodlevel;neighborhoodlevel development;objectives;optimize multiple;output;output measure;paper;passive;passive land;place;planner understand;planners;planning;plays;policies;population;population growth;population levels;provide;quality;range;rates;reality;recreational space;regional development;regions;residential satisfaction;role;satisfaction;scale;scale economy;small city;smart;smart decline;smart growth;social value;solutions;space;spatial variation;special role;state;states;stock;strategies;strategy;study;understand;united state;urban area;urban farming;uses;vacant;vacant land;vacant lot;value;values;variation;versus;versus passive,decision;decision model;demolish;design;land;land management;maintain;management;models;policy;policy design;repurpose policy;vacant;vacant land,520

There is a seismic shift needed for innovative public and private partnerships governing green infrastructure for local food production. This empirical multi-disciplinary case study uses business model innovation theory and green suburban infrastructure framework to examine the Countryside Conservancy Initiative start-up by Cuyahoga Valley National Park (CVNP) for managing urban farming technology and local food production and supply chain. After considering some alternate theoretical frameworks, we use a case study methodology. It is noted that despite various centralized attempts by federal and state governments to stop the decline of agriculture within CVNP, most historic food producing farms in existence since 1800s slipped into disrepair and disuse. The Countryside Initiative of CVNP was established in 1999 with an innovative 3P (public-private-philanthropic) partnership between public sector CVNP, private farms, and a not-for-profit Cuyahoga Valley Countryside Conservancy (CV-CC). This 3P partnership involved incentivizing 60-year long-term discounted leases for 13 agricultural farm lands, farm residences, and outbuildings to adopt and diffuse technological innovations for culturally intensive fruit and vegetable production, small intensive grazing operations, and small integrated crop-livestock production. Certified organic food production was encouraged, though not mandated. In this study, selection, growth and impact of family farm enterprises in the green suburban infrastructure in NEO region are investigated in the context of a business model innovation for family farmers.

A field study was therefore conducted to determine the global influence of the polluted environment (atmosphere, soil, and irrigation waters) on vegetable quality in a large urban-farming area. For leafy vegetables collected in 15 ha of squatted land belonging to the international airport of Cotonou, total concentrations of metal(loid)s measured in consumed parts of Lactuca sativa L. and Brassica oleracea were 52.6-78.9, 0.02-0.3, 0.08-0.22, 12.7-20.3, 1.8-7.9, and 44.1-107.8 mg kg-1 for Pb, Cd, As, Sb, Cu, and Zn, respectively. Human gastric bioaccessibility of the metal(loid)s was measured, and the obtained values varied according to the considered metal(loid) and the plant species. The results identified values that are commonly found in non-polluted soils and roots associated with contaminated edible parts, raising the possibility of atmospheric contamination. Such a hypothesis is in agreement with values of magnetic susceptibility, since iron oxides and probably their associated metal(loid)s do not translocate from the roots toward the upper parts of the plants. (Bioaccessible) estimated dose intake ((B)EDI) and total (bioaccessible) target hazard quotient (∑(B)THQ) were calculated to assess the health risk of consuming vegetables from this area. Pb and Sb were the major risk contributors. Taking the bioaccessible fractions into account, ∑BTHQ values were lower than ∑THQ but were all still &gt;1 for both males and females, leading to the conclusion that consuming these vegetables from this area is not risk-free",bioaccessibility;brassica oleracea (cabbage);foliar uptake;lactuca sativa l.

However challenges in energy use, structural loading and bioengineering need further work. Vertical planting uses skyscrapers or other vertical spaces to grow plants. Vertical farming is becoming more common due to the urbanization of smaller cities, and has become a valuable resource in plant production because it decreases the amount of land being used. Aquaponics combines aquaculture and hydroponics, allowing co-culture of fish and plants. The current study focused on optimizing biofilter design to maintain optimal water quality for fish and plants while maximizing growth rates to enhance food production sustainability in the urban setting. Hydroponics has become popular as a means of food production because of the decrease in land available for farming. Urbanization around the world has caused the amount of land available for farming and crop production to decline, and moved population away from traditional food production areas. Using hydroponics, water recirculates within the system, and is reduced by 98% as compared to conventional irrigation techniques. This study assessed parameters including ammonia, nitrite, nitrate, dissolved oxygen, total solids and growth rates of plants and animals to optimize the system. A biofilter is a pollution control technique using living material to capture and biologically degrade unwanted byproducts. In this study, the PolyGeyser® biofilter was used to reduce solids and nitrogen components. This device relies on bead filters to capture solids and perform biofiltration. First beads remove suspended solids from wastewater passing through. They do so by physical straining (> 80 microns), interception (20-80 microns), and bio-absorption (< 20 microns). Interception relies on the delicate collision between particles and the surface of the beads and bio-absorption relies on biofilms to remove the particles. The purified water exits the bead bed through outlets in the top of the biofilter. The beads not only provide a mechanism of filtration but also perform biofiltration. This project optimized an aquaponics system through the use of digital monitoring including pH, ammonia, nitrite, nitrate, temperature, dissolved oxygen, ORP and related information to maximize growth while minimizing energy and resource use. Ultimately, this can contribute to urban farming that reduces labor, enhances the urban environment and improves quality of li",aquaculture;aquaponics;biofilter;ecology;engineering;food production;sustainability,ammonia;aquaculture;biochemical oxygen demand;biofilters;biofiltration;byproducts;cultivation;dissolved oxygen;ecology;engineering;fish;nitrates;office buildings;oxygen;pollution control;population statistics;sustainable development;tall buildings;water quality;aquaponics;digital monitoring;food production;minimizing energy;nitrogen component;structural loading;urban environments;urban sustainability;urban growth,,,American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers,,9781632668455,,,English,Am Soc Agric Biol Eng Annu Int Meet,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84911464205,8,United States,United States,department of biological and agricultural engineering;department of civil and environmental engineering,department of biological and agricultural engineering,ammonia;amount;animals;aquaculture;aquaponics;areas;bead;bead bed;bead filter;beads;become;bed;bioabsorption;bioabsorption micron;bioabsorption relies;bioengineering;biofilms;biofilter;biofilter design;biofiltration;byproducts;capture;challenges;change;cities;coculture;collision;combine aquaculture;combines;components;contribute;control;control technique;conventional irrigation;crop;crop production;current study;decline;decrease;decreases;degrade;delicate;delicate collision;design;device;device relies;digital;digital monitoring;doorstep;energy;energy use;enhance;enhance food;enhances;environment;exits;filters;filtration;fish;food;food production;fresh food;grow;grow plant;grown;growth;growth rate;hydroponics;improves;information;interception;interception relies;irrigation;irrigation technique;labor;land;li;living;maintain;maintain optimal;material;means;mechanism;micron;microns;monitoring;need;nitrate;nitrogen;nitrogen component;ones;opportunity;optimal water;orp;outlets;oxygen;parameters;particles;passing;perform;perform biofiltration;ph;physical straining;plant;plant production;plants;pollution;pollution control;polygeyser®;polygeyser® biofilter;population;production;production area;production sustainability;project;provide;purified water;quality;rates;recirculates;reduces;related information;relies;resource;resource use;skyscrapers;solids;spaces;structural loading;study;surface;sustainability;system;technique;techniques;temperature;top;traditional food;unwanted byproduct;urban environment;urban farming;urban setting;urbanization;use;uses;valuable resource;vertical aquaponics;vertical farming;vertical planting;vertical space;wastewater;wastewater passing;water;water exit;water quality;water recirculates;work;world;world city;worlds,aquaponics;biofiltration;sustainability;synergistic vertical;system;urban sustainability;vertical aquaponics,523

Interestingly these systems have been around for over 40 years, but have only locally developed into main stream growing systems, mainly in Australia and Asia. This paper addresses the questions of what drives this renewed interest, why these systems haven't developed earlier - like for example stone wool-based systems - and whether hydroponic systems are reliable enough for sustainable, large scale introduction. We analysed case material of regional transition processes in horticultural production systems from over the past 50 years. We analysed the processes according to 1) the need for change in horticulture at the time - the main drivers, 2) the knowledge system available, 3) the knowledge available and 4) the windows of opportunity for introduction. Early adoption to hydroponic systems in the '70s led to system failures due to lack of knowledge of nutrient management, the role of oxygen, systematic design approaches, an over-focus on logistical solutions and disease management. By the time most of these issues were understood - in the '80s - the interest in hydroponic systems had made way for substrate-based systems in most areas of the world. Insights in disease management, emission reduction and a deeper understanding of root physiology however, have remained under-developed. Looking at the knowledge system surrounding successful introductions like the stone wool-based systems in the '80s, we find well-funded extension services to help growers adjust to the new systems and open-source innovation. Substrate-less systems largely lacked such support and lacked knowledge exchange due to large distances between first users. Extension activities were funded by governments as well as supplying companies with a vision for return on investment based on patents. For (easy to copy) hydroponic systems such knowledge protection was not available. Over the last 5-10 years a number of suppliers acquired knowledge protection through inventions on logistical aspects of the systems. We conclude that the renewed interest has a number of regional drivers such as depletion of land and societal interest in urban farming. However, to make hydroponic systems a lasting success, research effort should focus on reliable production: disease management, emission reduction and root development. Following, growers will need support to learn to operate these systems successfully. Given the current high needs, the international research interest and new forms of IP protection for suppliers, the time seems ripe for new, hydroponic systems to emer",adoption;deep flow technique;nutrient film technique;system design;transition,,,,International Society for Horticultural Science,05677572,9789462610217,,,English,Acta Hortic,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84902253081,7,United States;Netherlands;Mexico,Netherlands,Wageningen UR Greenhouse Horticulture;controlled environment agriculture center;asociacion hidroponica,Wageningen UR Greenhouse Horticulture,70s;activities;addresses;adjust;adoption;analysed case;approaches;areas;asia;aspects;australia;case;case material;change;companies;conclude;copy;copy hydroponic;deep;deeper;deeper understanding;depletion;design;design approach;developed;development;disease;disease management;distances;drivers;drives;dubbed;early adoption;effort;emer;emission;emission reduction;example;example stone;exchange;extension;extension activity;extension service;failures;film;film technique;flow;flow technique;focus;forms;governments;grower adjust;growers;havent;help;high need;horticultural production;horticulture;hydroponic;hydroponic system;innovation;insights;interest;international research;introduction;introductions;inventions;investment;ip;ip protection;issues;knowledge;knowledge exchange;knowledge protection;knowledge system;lack;land;large distance;large scale;last year;learn;logistical aspect;logistical solution;main driver;main stream;management;material;need;need support;needs;new form;new system;number;nutrient;nutrient film;nutrient management;opensource;opensource innovation;operate;opportunity;overfocus;oxygen;paper;paper address;past;patents;physiology;processes;production;production disease;production system;protection;questions;reduction;regional driver;regional transition;reliable production;require;research;research effort;research interest;return;ripe;role;root;root development;root physiology;scale;scale introduction;services;societal;societal interest;solutions;stone;stream;substrate;substratebased system;substrateless;substrateless system;success;successful introduction;suppliers;support;system;system failure;system havent;systematic design;systems;technique;ten;time;transition;transition process;understood;urban farming;users;vision;way;windows;woolbased system;world;year;years,hydroponic;hydroponic system;hype;new perspective;perspective;system hype;systems,524

The Framework indicates that all children should develop competencies in engineering design, and the NGSS explicitly includes a ""conceptual shift"" toward ""the integration of engineering and technology into the structure of science education"" (Achieve, Inc., 2013). This shift requires not only the adjustment of K-12 science curriculum and pedagogy, but also a transformation in the preparation of new K-12 teachers so that they possess the knowledge and skills necessary to include the discipline of engineering in their classrooms. This is especially important at the elementary school level, where teacher candidates tend to have limited academic preparation in science and little formal exposure to engineering. The teacher education community is limited in its understanding of how novice teachers of elementary students learn to teach science. Because engineering has previously not been a common component of elementary school science education, even less is known about how novice elementary teachers learn to teach engineering. Research is needed to inform a new model for preparing pre-service elementary teachers to teach engineering. In this research study in progress, we are developing and investigating an innovative model that introduces novice elementary teachers to ""community-based engineering design"" as a strategy for teaching and learning in urban schools. Community-based engineering experiences for urban schools involve the finding and solving of technological problems in students' local environment, such as their neighborhoods, community centers, or schools. For example, elementary students might notice a nearby vacant lot and design and build tools and techniques to prepare its soil for urban gardening. Or they might identify limitations of their local playground and design and build prototype play equipment that would better meet the needs of children in their neighborhood. Or perhaps the local Boys and Girls' Club needs to update its game room, and elementary students design and build prototype arcade games. Each of these engineering experiences would respond to a problem in the local community and engage students in framing a problem, planning a solution, and prototyping and testing artifacts. Each community-based engineering experience could also connect to a unit in the school science curriculum, reinforce disciplinary core ideas from the NGSS, and engage students in key science and engineering practices. To investigate the community-based engineering approach to preparing new elementary teachers to teach engineering, we are asking three key research questions. During community-based engineering experiences, what is the evolution of novice urban elementary teachers': 1. Understanding of engineering practices? 2. Abilities of engineering design? 3. Abilities to identify and respond productively to students' engineering ideas and practices? To answer the research questions, we are employing a mixed methods study design.

Urban farmers, unlike other urban agricultural projects, farm to make a living. They raise produce and grow ornamentals to sell in their community, while building food literacy and comfort for customers and the surrounding community. As we look to develop localized and sustainable food production systems, it is imperative to understand what, if any, models are economically, socially, and environmentally sustainable. Previous research has typically focused on community gardens and their social benefits, leaving much unknown about entrepreneurial urban farms. This study takes a first look at the business models and economics of Vancouver's urban farms through a newly developed tool, the ""Urban Farming Census"". This tool reveals revenues, costs, financing, and sales models of urban farmers as well as their community connections and benefits.

On the basis of field interviews in the rapidly expanding metropolitan area of Kampala (Uganda) three different urban farming types were identified: subsistence farming, garden farming and commercial farming. These three urban farming types have their own spatial organisation logic and each interact in a specific way with urban expansion. In this paper the possible outcome of three alternative urban management strategies for Kampala (urban sprawl, urban infilling and a combination of both) were translated into spatially explicit land use scenarios for the years 2020 and 2030. This allowed to evaluate the spatial impact of each scenario on the future viability of the different urban farming practices. Urban sprawl fragments large open spaces thereby reducing the space for subsistence farming with 80% by 2030. Urban infilling, on the other hand, decreases the opportunities for small to medium scale garden and commercial farming by a possible reduction of 62% of the available farming land by 2030. The results of the analysis are useful for urban planners as they give insight in the potential future effects of proposed planning strategies on urban farming",kampala;scenario development;urban farming;urban growth;urban policy,farming system;metropolitan area;subsistence agriculture;urban development;urban growth;urban planning;urban policy;kampala;uganda,"Vermeiren, K.; Earth and Environmental Science, Catholic University Leuven, Celestijnenlaan 200E b 2409, B-3001 Heverlee, Belgium; email: karolien.vermeiren@ees.kuleuven.be",,,02648377,,,,English,Land Use Policy,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84878799569,5,Uganda;Belgium,Belgium,department of earth and environmental science;department of geography,department of earth and environmental science,activities;african city;alternative;analysis;area;available farming;basis;cities;combination;commercial farming;deal;decreases;different urban;effects;evaluate;expansion;explicit;explicit land;fact;farming practice;field;field interview;fragments;future;future effect;future viability;garden;garden farming;hand;impact;insight;interact;interviews;kampala;kampala uganda;land;land use;logic;management;management strategy;medium;medium scale;metropolitan;metropolitan area;open space;opportunities;organisation;organisation logic;outcome;paper;planners;planning;planning strategy;possible outcome;possible reduction;potential future;practices;reduction;results;scale;scale garden;scenario;scenarios;space;space thereby;spaces;spatial impact;spatial organisation;specific way;sprawl;sprawl fragment;strategies;subsistence;subsistence farming;types;uganda;urban expansion;urban farming;urban infilling;urban management;urban planner;urban planning;urban sprawl;use;use scenario;viability;view;way;year;years,african city;casestudy;cities;growth;kampala;kampala uganda;survive;uganda;urban farming,527

It is a concept developed based on the theory of sensitivity. It's about the rise of satisfaction, which we understand as aesthetic experience which every individual perceives and creates. Unlike the arts which tend to be predefined and shaped by the past such as architecture, sculpture, painting, music, poetry, etc., the aesthetic experience is another artistic form closer to our daily experiences. Currently this way of understanding the art exists in many Common Places, such as self-run autonomous social centers and urban gardens. To construct an epistemology of this phenomenon in aesthetic study, we must use the paradigm ""symptom-paradigms-styles-examples"", constituting the knowledge from the social context and from the internal analysis about how the thoughts and the actions bring power to all individuals. From this reflection, this essay shows how this social model makes everyone be artist. This paper reconsiders the internal analysis of aesthetic experience through texts and reflections of Hegel, Schiller and Dewey, in which they had previously debated the spirit of the artisan. Finally, I reason how spaces created in this way have a social impact, since lately many ideas related to the concept of Degrowth and ""transition town"" movements have emerg",aesthetic experience;common places;self-run autonomous social centers;spirit of artisan;urban farming,,"Chen, Y.; Facultad de Bellas Artes, Universidad Complutense de MadridSpain; email: chenaliciayiju@gmail.com",,,11315598,,,,Spanish,Arte Individuo Soc,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84885047913,1,Spain,Spain,universidad complutense de madrid,universidad complutense de madrid,action bring;actions;aesthetic experience;aesthetic study;analysis;architecture;art;art exists;artisan;artist;artistic form;arts;authorship;bring;centers;closer;common place;concept;construct;context;creates;creative process;daily experience;degrowth;developed;dewey;emerg;epistemology;essay;etc;everyone;exists;experience;experiences;form;form closer;gardens;hegel;ideas;impact;individual perceives;individuals;internal analysis;knowledge;many idea;model;movements;music;painting;paper;paper reconsiders;paradigm;paradigm symptomparadigmsstylesexamples;past;perceives;phenomenon;places;poetry;power;process;propose;public;public authorship;reason;reconsiders;reflection;reflections;resurrection;rise;satisfaction;schiller;sculpture;selfrun;sensitivity;shows;social center;social context;social impact;social model;spaces;spirit;study;symptomparadigmsstylesexamples;tend;texts;theory;thoughts;town;town movement;transition;transition town;understand;urban garden;use;want;way,authorship;common place;creative process;places;process;public;public authorship;resurrection,530

For the first time, more than half of the world population now lives in cities. In many developing countries, the urbanization process goes along with increasing urban poverty and polluted environment, growing food insecurity and malnutrition, especially for children, pregnant and lactating women; and increasing unemployment. Urban agriculture represents an opportunity for improving food supply, health conditions, local economy, social integration, and environmental sustainability altogether. Urban agriculture is present throughout the world in a diversity of farming systems. Urban dwellers ranging 25-30 % are involved worldwide in the agro-food sector. Urban agriculture will gain in recognition for its benefits and services because urban population and rural-urban migration are increasing. The actual scarcity of knowledge on urban agriculture has somehow hindered the relevance of this activity. Here, we review the social, cultural, technical, economic, environmental, and political factors affecting urban agriculture with examples taken in East Asia, South America, or East Africa. We discuss the definition, benefits, and limitations of urban agriculture. Food security benefit of urban agriculture is evidenced by 100-200 million urban farmers worldwide providing the city markets with fresh horticultural goods. Urban agriculture favors social improvement since the poors spend up to 85 % of their income in food purchase and most urban farmers belong to poorest populations. Sociologically urban farming favors both social inclusion and reduction of gender inequalities, as 65 % of urban farmers are women. Urban agriculture has ecological benefits by reducing the city waste, improving urban biodiversity and air quality, and overall reducing the environmental impact related to both food transport and storage. The production of horticultural goods shows the main benefits of urban agriculture. Fruit and vegetable crops give high yields, up to 50 kg m-2 year-1, a more efficient use of agricultural inputs, high added value, and rapidly perishable products that can easily substitute the rural production in the local market. Urban horticulture is the most competitive branch of urban farming due to the high cost of urban land and with the need of high water- and fertilizer-use efficiency. Traditional urban horticulture systems are classified in four types: allotment and family gardens, simplified extensive systems, shifting cultivation, and intensive systems. We describe also innovative systems including organoponics and simplified soilless cultures",agriculture and food systems;biodiversity;food and nutrition security;food city supply;simplified hydroponics;urban agriculture;water and waste management,cultural influence;developing world;environmental factor;environmental impact;food security;food supply;hydroponics;innovation;malnutrition;poverty;resource use;rural-urban migration;shifting cultivation;socioeconomic conditions;species diversity;unemployment;urban agriculture;urbanization;waste management;east africa;far east;south america,"Orsini, F.; Department of Agricultural Sciences, DIPSA, University of Bologna, Viale Fanin, 44, 40127 Bologna, Italy; email: f.orsini@uibo.it",,,17740746,,,,English,Agron Sustainable Dev,Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84885657924,4,Italy;France,Italy,department of agricultural sciences,department of agricultural sciences,activity;actual scarcity;africa;agricultural input;agriculture;agriculture favor;agrofood;agrofood sector;air;air quality;allotment;america;asia;belong;benefit;benefits;biodiversity;branch;children;cities;city;city market;city waste;competitive branch;conditions;cost;countries;critical event;crops;cultivation;cultures;definition;describe;discuss;diversity;dwellers;east;east africa;east asia;ecological benefit;economy;efficiency;efficient;efficient use;environment;environmental impact;environmental sustainability;event;examples;extensive system;factors;family;family garden;farmer belong;farmer worldwide;farmers;favors;fertilizeruse;fertilizeruse efficiency;first time;food;food insecurity;food purchase;food security;food supply;food transport;fresh horticultural;fruit;gain;gardens;gender;gender inequality;good show;goods;half;health;health conditions;high cost;high water;high yield;history;horticultural good;horticulture;horticulture system;impact;improvement;inclusion;income;inequalities;innovative system;inputs;insecurity;integration;intensive system;kg;kg m2;knowledge;land;limitations;lives;local economy;local market;m2;m2 year1;main benefit;malnutrition;marked;market;markets;migration;need;opportunity;organoponics;overall reducing;perishable product;political factor;poor spend;poorest;poors;population;populations;poverty;pregnant;present;process;production;products;purchase;quality;recognition;reduction;relevance;review;rural production;ruralurban;ruralurban migration;scarcity;sector;security;security benefit;services;shows;social improvement;social inclusion;social integration;soilless;soilless culture;somehow;south;south america;spend;storage;substitute;supply;sustainability;systems;time;traditional urban;transport;type allotment;types;unemployment;urban agriculture;urban biodiversity;urban dweller;urban farmer;urban farming;urban horticulture;urban land;urban population;urban poverty;urbanization;urbanization process;use;value;vegetable;vegetable crop;waste;water;women;world;world history;world population;worldwide;year;year1;yields,agriculture;review;urban agriculture;world,531

Box 3900, Eldoret, Kenya","This paper explores gendered patterns of access to and utilization of land by urban farmers in Eldoret (Kenya). It shows that the urban farmers established entitlement over farming spaces mainly through purchase, social connections, and informal use of land around their dwellings. Owing partly to social norms and cultural practices, and partly to their better economic status, it was mostly the men who had greater entitlement to farming spaces in male-headed households; but female household heads also accessed land in their own right, although they accessed land to a limited extent and their holdings were generally smaller than men's. However, despite high incidences of non-ownership of land among them, married women seemed to enjoy considerable access and use rights over household land for urban farming, but such rights were more limited for other land uses such as housing.

Rooftop farming is a strategy for intensifying urban agriculture activities, which can not only improve nutrition and food security in urban neighborhoods, but also reduce the energy consumption of air-condition and ease the power shortage in urban area of metropolitan regions. In this study, a thermal experiment and an index of energy saving analysis were carried out in Zhongshan, Guangdong Province, China in August 2011, measuring external and internal surface temperatures of roofs with and without greening, using the same set of climate parameters. The experiment results show that the green roof with urban farming can contribute to the modulation of air temperature in the interior spaces of building. During the hot days in summer, the external surface temperatures of green roof are lower than the normal flat one. The result also reveals that external surfaces of vegetated green roof system could effectively lower surface temperature by 6°C and save 18.7% electric power, comparing with the general flat roof of traditional building",energy saving;green roof;roof temperature;thermal measuring;urban farming,energy saving analysis;green roof;metropolitan regions;residential districts;surface temperatures;thermal measuring;traditional buildings;urban farming;computer science;energy conservation;energy utilization;experiments;food supply;roofs;surface properties;atmospheric temperature,"School of Architecture, State Key Lab of Subtropical Building Science, South China University of Technology GuangzhouChina",,,10226680,9783037857274,,,English,Adv Mater Res,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84882958219,3,China,China,school of architecture,school of architecture,activities;agriculture;agriculture activity;air;air temperature;aircondition;analysis;area;august;building;china;cities;climate;climate parameter;consumption;contribute;days;ease;electric power;energy;energy consumption;experiment;experiment result;external surface;facing problem;flat roof;food;food security;general flat;green roof;greenery;greenery space;guangdong;guangdong province;heat;heat island;hot day;index;interior;interior space;internal surface;island;lack;metropolitan;metropolitan region;modulation;neighborhoods;nowadays;nutrition;parameters;power;power shortage;problems;province;regions;result;result show;results;reveals;roof;roof system;roofs;rooftop;rooftop farming;security;set;shortage;show;space;spaces;strategy;study;summer;surface;surface temperature;surfaces;system;temperature;temperatures;thermal;thermal experiment;traditional building;urban agriculture;urban area;urban city;urban farming;urban heat;urban neighborhood;world;zhongshan,analysis;case;case study;district;garden;julong;residential district;rooftop;rooftop farming;study;thermal;thermal measuring;zhongshan,534

Its assumed main ethical value is the concept of justice as fair distribution of outputs, with the main aim to reduce hunger and to optimalize sustainability. Although this paradigm can be proud of its enormous success to feed the world, it also produces huge problems, which make it unsustainable and not fair. The approach decreases biodiversity, increases erosion, is animal unfriendly and depletes scarce resources. It has an huge impact on climate change and its economic and patenting system increases the gap between rich and poor, thereby reducing chances for rural livelihood, producing unemployment, inherently instable social relations and food insecurity. Probably, it can produce food for even more than eight billion in 2050 with enormous cost. The agrosystem approach, its alternative, starts with local farming practices and innovation activities. It implicitly acknowledges the ethical value of how to lead a good life. However, variants of this approach either give farmers full priority in what and how to produce (as in agrarianism) or give consumers the lead (as in urban gardening). The current utilitarian and deontological ethical approaches are quite blind for how to deal with these strategies that cut across justice, good life and other values. Due to the dynamics of social, economic and cultural systems, agricultural priorities cannot anymore be established one sided by either farmers (and producers) or consumers. Sustainability and climate change require changing consumer food styles (in expanding urban areas) and new farming styles. To improve the approach of agrosystem into one of plural and democratic agrosystems, I propose to make room conceptually for the negotiation and cooperation of farmers and consumers about their interests, preferences and values. In this revised agrosystem approach a concept of justice is assumed not as fair distribution but as fair recognition of farming and food styles. This ethical notion enables to take into account the pluralism of farming and food styles and various interactive ways of intensification and innovation with consumers",agrarianism;food democracy;productionism;types of intensification,,"Korthals, M.; Wageningen University, Hollandseweg 1, Netherlands; email: michiel.korthals@wur.nl",,Springer Netherlands,,9789086867844; 9789086862313,,,English,"The Ethics of Consum: The Citiz, the Mark and the Law",Book Chapter,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84960227870,1,Netherlands,Netherlands,wageningen university,wageningen university,account;acknowledges;activities;agrarianism;agricultural priority;agriculture;agrosystem;agrosystem approach;agrosystems;aim;alternative;animal;approach;approach decrease;approaches;areas;biodiversity;blind;cannot;chances;change;change require;climate;climate change;concept;consumer;consumer food;consumers;cooperation;cost;cultural system;cut;deal;decrease biodiversity;decreases;democratic agrosystems;deontological ethical;depletes;distribution;dynamics;emphasizes;enables;enormous cost;enormous success;erosion;ethical approach;ethical notion;ethical value;fair;fair distribution;fair recognition;farmers;farming practice;feed;food;food insecurity;food style;full priority;gap;gardening;good life;high material;high tech;huge impact;huge problem;hunger;impact;increases;innovation;innovation activity;inputs;insecurity;intensification;interactive way;interests;justice;lead;life;livelihood;local farming;main aim;make room;material;material output;negotiation;new farming;notion;notion enables;optimalize sustainability;output;outputs;paradigm;pluralism;practices;preferences;priorities;priority;priority cannot;problems;produce;produce food;producers;produces;productionist;productionist paradigm;propose;proud;recognition;relations;require;require changing;resources;room;rural livelihood;scarce;scarce resource;social relation;starts;strategies;styles;success;sustainability;system;system increase;systems;tech;tech input;unemployment;urban area;urban gardening;value;values;variants;ways;world,food;innovation;recognition;styles,535

The maintenance of food security is an increasing challenge for modern cities where natural resources (especially arable land) are limited. One key food resource of mankind is vegetable that contains most of the essential components of human nutrition. However, fresh vegetables are perishable and cannot be stocked. To secure reliable vegetable supplies, modern cities such as Singapore need to increase local vegetable production to a certain level of self-sufficiency since erratic climatic conditions can affect the production via traditional methods. Thus urban farming through the adoption of the enabling powers of technology can offer a solution. We have used novel aeroponics technology to produce fresh vegetables in Singapore since 1997. This innovative system allows production of all vegetables, all year round by simply cooling the roots while the aerial parts grow under tropical ambient environments. While it is not possible for arable land to be expanded horizontally, an urban farming system could increase production area through vertical extensions. Vertical stacking of troughs is constrained by the weight factor of the troughs. This could however be resolved through the lightweight aeroponic system. Furthermore, crop management techniques on aeroponic can further enhance crop growth and this could also boost productivity beyond that achieved even by more efficient use of land area. For instance, efficient delivery of the nutrient solution, introduction of higher levels of CO 2 to root-zone and mitigate the level of growth inhibitor such as ethylene within the aeroponic system can increase crop growth rate, further enhancing farming efficiency. We could also adopt newly developed light sources such as LEDs for vertical aeroponic farming system to promote uniform plant growth while saving energy. Improving the utilisation of available land via novel engineering and plant physiological solutions, will offer an efficient model of a vertical farm suitable for large scale vegetable production in the modern ci",aeroponic culture;food security;led lighting;photosynthesis;productivity;vertical farming,,,,International Society for Horticultural Science,05677572,,,,English,Acta Hortic,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84892716812,2,Singapore,Singapore,national institute of education,national institute of education,access;adopt;adoption;aerial part;aeroponic;aeroponic farming;aeroponic system;aeroponics;affect;allows;ambient;ambient environment;arable land;area;available land;boost;boost productivity;cannot;certain level;challenge;ci;cities;climatic condition;co;components;conditions;contains;crop;crop growth;crop management;delivery;developed;dietary need;economic access;efficiency;efficient;efficient delivery;efficient model;efficient use;energy;engineering;enhance;enhance crop;environments;erratic climatic;essential component;ethylene;extensions;factor;fao;farm;farm suitable;food;food preference;food resource;food security;fresh vegetable;grow;growth;growth inhibitor;growth rate;healthy life;human;human nutrition;increase;increase crop;increase production;inhibitor;innovative system;instance;introduction;key;key food;land;land area;large scale;leds;level;levels;life;life fao;light;light source;lightweight;lightweight aeroponic;local vegetable;maintenance;management;management technique;mankind;meets;methods;mitigate;model;modern ci;modern city;natural resource;need;needs;novel;novel aeroponics;novel engineering;nutrient;nutrient solution;nutrition;nutritious food;offer;part grow;parts;people;physiological solution;plant;plant growth;plant physiological;powers;preferences;produce;production;production area;productivity;promote;promote uniform;rate;reliable vegetable;resource;resources;roots;rootzone;round;scale;scale vegetable;secure;security;selfsufficiency;singapore;solution;solutions;sources;sufficient;supplies;system;system allows;techniques;technology;times;traditional method;tropical ambient;troughs;uniform;uniform plant;urban farming;use;utilisation;vegetable;vegetable production;vegetable supply;vegetables;vertical aeroponic;vertical extension;vertical farm;vertical stacking;weight;weight factor;year;year round,change;city;climate;climate change;food;food security;impact;modern city;security;solutions,536

This interest has led to public and private investment in community food production and increased need for urban agricultural planning as a way to manage growth and prioritize resource allocation. Municipal planning and thoughtful institutional support for the practice will require program evaluation and greater attention to the spatial composition and configuration of this widely dispersed practice. This article explores the results of community-supported landscape socio-ecological research in Madison, WI (USA) to assess the spatial and social dynamics of community food production. Results indicate that community food production resources are unevenly distributed across the study area. Historic community garden placement does appear to be consistent with community prioritization which dictates placing resources in areas with low median household income. However, home garden presence and recent community garden placement both occur in areas of higher than average median household income.

And does UPA practised by urban farmers of foreign origin contribute to the expansion of biodiversity in cities? A comparative analysis of current peri-urban agriculture practices in Lisbon and London was carried out in allotment gardens and other spaces far from the centre in and on the edges of these capital cities. In both cases, a significant proportion of the migrant population is involved in two different frameworks: regulated in London and non-regulated in Lisbon. The paper concludes that patterns of social inclusion are quite city specific: urban farming communities from the Cape Verde islands maintain and strengthen community bonds through their activity but this does not necessary lead to better social integration within the wider Portuguese society. In London, migrants of foreign origin become part of an integrated communitarism on an individual basis. Concerning the contribution of peri-urban agriculture to biodiversity, evidence gathered strongly suggests that urban farmers of foreign origin do contribute to broadening biodiversity primarily in Lisbon and to a lesser extent in London.

Water samples were collected in summer and winter from selected sites across the study area and were analysed for salinity as well as for concentrations of major and minor ions. Each site consists of one borehole and one pond. Isotope analysis was done for the summer samples so as to assess effects of evaporation on water quality and salinity. Descriptive statistics were used to compare the variation in range of concentration of specific ions with the recommended ranges set by the South African Department of Water Affairs and Forestry (DWAF) and the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO). Geographical information system (GIS) analysis was used to describe the spatial distribution of salinity across the study area, and hydro-geochemical analysis was used to assess the possibility of seawater intrusion into the aquifer system and to characterise groundwater in the study area. The results of the research showed that the concentrations of chloride, nitrate, potassium and sodium exceeded the target maximum limit according to DWAF and FAO guidelines. Groundwater and pond water were also observed to be brackish in most parts of the research area in terms of total dissolved salts content, and fresh water was only found in the middle section of the research area. It is concluded that the accumulation of salts in groundwater and soil in the study area is mainly due to the agricultural activities and partially due to the natural movement of water through the geological formation of the Cape Flats region. These findings permit the formulation of a conceptual model of the occurrence of the salinization process, which implies that the groundwater and pond water in the study area are generally suitable for irrigation purposes, but need to be used with caution as the vegetables grown are classified as sensitive and moderately sensitive to salt according to DWAF guidelines for irrigation water quality (1996).

Such studies have shown that restoring peatlands may be successfully achieved and will bring back habitats and biodiversity in areas previously submitted to peat extraction and plant communities. Meanwhile, the unique long term C sequestration function of peatland ecosystems can be re-established. However, the C footprint of peat extraction is still real, as long-term locked up carbon is released through exposition with oxygen; but the fate of C after peat usage and its interaction with the atmosphere is still a largely unknown field of peatland C cycle. Preliminary results indicate that raw Sphagnum fibers could be successfully used in growing media, diminishing largely the C footprint. Switching from peat to other components using compost and other industrial byproducts appears a valuable alternative towards sustainability and allows the use of suppressive microorganisms in these medium.

However, some production and handling practises and a short supply chain may expose consumers to substantial health risks. This study of consumers, peri-urban farmers, and traders attempts to quantify subjective risk judgments with regard to food safety hazards, and examines the extent of discrepancies in perceived risk relating to vegetables in domestic urban markets among the three groups. A conceptual model was developed to elicit subjective risk perceptions for a multidimensional construct. In general, differences were found between respondent categories in terms of both specific source risks and overall risks.

This paper discusses lessons for food security from historic and prehistoric cities. The Chicago school of urban sociology established a modernist understanding of urbanism as an essentialist reality separate from its larger life-support system. However, different urban histories have given rise to a remarkable spatial diversity and temporal variation viewed at the global and long-term scales that are often overlooked in urban scholarship. Drawing on two case studies from widely different historical and cultural contexts - the Classic Maya civilization of the late first millennium AD and Byzantine Constantinople - this paper demonstrates urban farming as a pertinent feature of urban support systems over the long-term and global scales. We show how urban gardens, agriculture, and water management as well as the linked social-ecological memories of how to uphold such practices over time have contributed to long-term food security during eras of energy scarcity. We exemplify with the function of such local blue-green infrastructures during chocks to urban supply lines. We conclude that agricultural production is not ""the antithesis of the city,"" but often an integrated urban activity that contribute to the resilience of cities",agricultures and gardens;blue-green infrastructure;constantinople;food security;pre-columbian maya;social-ecological resilience,agricultural production;civilization;food security;prehistoric;urban agriculture;urban area;urban history;water management,"Barthel, S.; Department of History, Stockholm University, SE-106 91 Stockholm, Sweden; email: stephan.barthel@historia.su.se",,,09218009,,ECECE,,English,Ecol Econ,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84874005092,2,Sweden,Sweden,department of history;stockholm resilience center;the beijer institute of ecological economics;department of archaeology and ancient history,department of history,activity;ad;agricultural production;agriculture;antithesis;bluegreen;bluegreen infrastructure;byzantine;byzantine constantinople;case;case study;chicago;chicago school;chocks;cities;city;civilization;classic maya;conclude;constantinople;contexts;contribute;cultural context;demonstrates;different urban;discus lesson;discusses;diversity;energy;energy scarcity;eras;essentialist;essentialist reality;facet;feature;food;food security;function;gardens;global scale;historic;histories;infrastructures;key;key resilience;lessons;lifesupport;lifesupport system;lines;living;local bluegreen;longterm;longterm scale;management;maya;maya civilization;memories;millennium;millennium ad;modernist;modernist understanding;paper;paper demonstrates;paper discus;people;pertinent;pertinent feature;practices;prehistoric;prehistoric city;production;reality;reality separate;remarkable spatial;resilience;resilience facet;rise;scales;scarcity;scholarship;school;security;show;socialecological memory;sociology;spatial diversity;studies;supply;supply line;support;support system;system;systems;temporal variation;time;urban activity;urban farming;urban garden;urban history;urban scholarship;urban sociology;urban supply;urban support;urbanism;variation;water;water management,agriculture;cities;food;food security;gardens;longterm;management;management source;resilience;security;sources;urban gardens;water;water management,551

Few providers supplied few consumers. Direct sales (from producer to consumer) were predominant, consequently, locally or regionally organized commodity chains with only a few chain members were prevailing. Since that time, the organic food market has become a dynamically growing market segment with new organizational patterns. The most important reasons for the structural changes are the increasing demand, changed buying motives (from altruistic and holistically ecological to individual), the market entry and by now domination of the conventional food retailing in the organic food sector as well as the proportionally small increase of domestic area used for organic farming in comparison to the increase in demand of organic food: This is true for Germany but in particular for Berlin and Brandenburg. The opening question was how eco Berlin is. Organic food is gaining ground, however, the original ecological objectives (apart from organic also regional, seasonal and fair) become less important. Instead of locally and regionally organized commodity chains and equalized power relations that lead to fair conditions for all stakeholders, national and international production systems as well as hierarchical organizational structures controlled by only a few (conventional) retail chains are gaining in importance. Maybe this is why the original ecological idea is revived in many places in Berlin, like for example by the action group ""Fair & Regional.

Box 1, 3720 BA Bilthoven, Netherlands","Consumption of vegetables that are grown in urban areas takes place worldwide. In developing countries, vegetables are traditionally grown in urban areas for cheap food supply. In developing and developed countries, urban gardening is gaining momentum. A problem that arises with urban gardening is the presence of contaminants in soil, which can be taken up by vegetables. In this study, a scientifically-based and practical procedure has been developed for assessing the human health risks from the consumption of vegetables from cadmium-contaminated land. Starting from a contaminated site, the procedure follows a tiered approach which is laid out as follows. In Tier 0, the plausibility of growing vegetables is investigated. In Tier 1 soil concentrations are compared with the human health-based Critical soil concentration. Tier 2 offers the possibility for a detailed site-specific human health risk assessment in which calculated exposure is compared to the toxicological reference dose. In Tier 3, vegetable concentrations are measured and tested following a standardized measurement protocol. To underpin the derivation of the Critical soil concentrations and to develop a tool for site-specific assessment the determination of the representative concentration in vegetables has been evaluated for a range of vegetables. The core of the procedure is based on Freundlich-type plant-soil relations, with the total soil concentration and the soil properties as variables. When a significant plant-soil relation is lacking for a specific vegetable a geometric mean of BioConcentrationFactors (BCF) is used, which is normalized according to soil properties. Subsequently, a 'conservative' vegetable-group-consumption-rate-weighted BioConcentrationFactor is calculated as basis for the Critical soil concentration (Tier 1). The tool to perform site-specific human health risk assessment (Tier 2) includes the calculation of a 'realistic worst case' site-specific vegetable-group-consumption-rate-weighted BioConcentrationFactor",cadmium;human health risks;plant uptake;soil pollution;vegetable consumption,cadmium;cadmium;food supply;health risk;risk assessment;soil pollution;urban area;vegetable;article;calculation;concentration (parameters);environmental exposure;food contamination;food intake;hazard assessment;health hazard;human;measurement;priority journal;risk assessment;soil property;toxicology;urban area;vegetable;cadmium;human health risks;plant uptake;soil pollution;vegetable consumption;cadmium;cities;humans;risk assessment;vegetables,"Swartjes, F.A.; National Institute of Public Health and the Environment (RIVM), P.O.

Through extensive fieldwork, and drawing upon social theories of learning, we describe learning communities in four PAC-gardens and analyse factors that influence participation and boundary interaction, that is when experiences brought in from the outside encounter socially defined competences. Results show that these PAC-gardens have self-generated social and physical structures, which to different degrees inhibit or facilitate boundary interactions, whereas skills of individuals to put those to work, in combination with the quality of the surrounding neighbourhoods, can be ascribed for creating broader participation and greater diversity in the content of learning about local sustainability. Identified learning streams included learning about gardening and local ecological conditions; about urban politics, and about social entrepreneurship. We discuss results in relation to environmental learning that combats the generational amnesia in cities about our dependence on nature, where PAC-gardens clearly distinguish themselves from more closed forms of urban gardening such as allotment gardens and gated community gardens. We conclude that PAC-gardens that intertwine gardening with social, political and economic practices can create broader and more heterogeneous learning about social-ecological conditions, and help develop sense-of-place in degraded neighbourhoods",civic engagement;communities of practice;environmental learning;extinction of experience;place-making;public-access community gardens,civic engagement;communities of practice;environmental learning;place-making;public-access community gardens;conservation;ecology;community care;economic analysis;garden;greenspace;neighborhood;participatory approach;public access;sustainability;urban politics;berlin;germany,"Bendt, P.; Stockholm University, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; email: pim.bendt@gmail.com",,,01692046,,LUPLE,,English,Landsc Urban Plann,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84870377392,3,Sweden,Sweden,beijer institute of ecological economics;stockholm resilience center;department of history,beijer institute of ecological economics,allotment;allotment garden;amnesia;analyse;ascribed;berlin;boundary;boundary interaction;broader;brought;cities;civil society;closed form;combats;combination;communities;community;community garden;competences;conclude;conditions;content;create;create broader;degree inhibit;degrees;dependence;describe;describe learning;different degree;discus result;discuss;distinguish;diversity;ecological condition;economic practice;encounter;entrepreneurship;environmental learning;experiences;extensive fieldwork;facilitate;facilitate boundary;factors;fieldwork;forms;garden pacgardens;gardening;gardens;generational;generational amnesia;green space;groups;help;individuals;influence;influence participation;inhibit;interaction;interactions;intertwine;intertwine gardening;local ecological;local sustainability;nature;neighbourhoods;outside encounter;pacgardens;participation;physical structure;politics;practices;public;public green;publicaccess;publicaccess community;put;quality;relation;result show;results;senseofplace;show;skills;social entrepreneurship;social theory;socialecological condition;society;society group;spaces;streams;structures;sustainability;theories;urban gardening;urban politics;whereas;work,berlin;civic;civic greening;community;community garden;environmental learning;gardens;publicaccess;publicaccess community,559

Integrating technology into this discourse introduces a milieu of associations, expectations and conclusions about how technological innovation, practices and products should be steered, which can also influence what we both make and teach. The web has since evolved into a pervasively instantaneous space for more involved forms of communication (Google hangout), content sharing (SVN), publishing (blogs), community building (messageboards, Facebook), creative performance (Isadora) and more. Now creative interactive initiatives are not limited to merely making a statement or triggering a semiotic synapse, but rather can have a social impact, enacting, mobilizing and serving as a resource for the public. Telematic Art that includes the activities surrounding Digital Communities and their behaviour, does not merely provide an environment to discuss social issues, but embodies social interaction in ways in which new forms of collective expression can be realized. The development of telematics tools is empowering for the public while serving as a medium that influences how individuals interact. Between DIY/DIWO models, open source hardware, software, and creation initiatives, practivist initiatives, creative hacking ideologies, immersion, and web-based communication tools to localize the international collaborative workshop, I believe our formats for education and exchange are becoming more collective and empowering, and with the inclusion of digital social collaboration initiatives seen in myriad examples of Telematic Art, there exists the potential to motivate a mindset desiring new shifts in perception and making with the goals of serving the global community in significant and direct wa",collaboration;consciousness;cybernetics;food deserts;lilipad;refarmthecity;urban farming;waterworks,,"Kazemzadeh, M.; Gallaudet UniversityUnited States",,Intellect Ltd.,1477965X,,,,English,Technoetic Arts,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84897490960,1,United States,United States,gallaudet university,gallaudet university,activities;activity;aim;arduous exploration;art;associations;behaviour;blogs;borders;building;building messageboards;clash;collaboration;collaboration initiative;collaborative;collaborative workshop;collective;collective expression;collectives;communication;communication google;communication tool;communities;community;community building;community use;conclusions;connects;content;creation;creation initiative;creative activity;creative digital;creative hacking;creative interactive;creative performance;culture;development;dictatorial;dictatorial ethic;digital;digital community;direct wa;discourse;discourse introduces;discuss;diydiwo;diydiwo model;dogma;education;embodies;environment;environments;ethics;examples;exchange;exists;expectations;exploration;expression;facebook;formats;forms;functions;future;global community;goals;google;google hangout;hangout;hardware;history;humancentric;humancentric collective;icon;identity;ideologies;ideology;image;immersion;impact;inclusion;individual interact;individuals;influence;influences;initiatives;innovation;instantaneous space;interact;interaction;interactive initiative;international collaborative;introduces;isadora;issues;living;localize;maintain;meaning;medium;messageboards;methods;milieu;mindset;mindset desiring;models;motivate;myriad;myriad example;new form;new shift;open source;perception;performance;performance isadora;politics;postnational;practices;practivist;practivist initiatives;products;provide;public;publishing;question;raises;reference;resource;secure;semiotic synapse;shifts;significance;social collaboration;social impact;social interaction;social issue;software;source;source hardware;space;statement;sustainability;svn;synapse;teach;technollaboration;technological innovation;technology;telematic art;telematics;tools;treat;urban living;use;use technology;view;view impact;village;villagecentric;villagecentric view;wa;way;ways;web;works;workshop;world,apophenoetic prophecy;postbiotanical village;postnational;postnational technollaboration;prophecy;technollaboration;village,560

This concept paper discusses the challenges involved in using humanure for urban farming specifically in the developed world. It takes a broadly actor-network approach to acknowledge these challenges and suggests possible directions for addressing them. First providing a brief overview of attitudes towards human excreta across cultures, particularly the dichotomous views of waste or resource, it then outlines the crucial development of water-based sanitation in England in the 19th century and the spread of this technology across the developed world. Next various techniques of humanure (human excreta) use in agriculture are introduced before a particular focus on the technique of urine diversion is proposed. Finally discussing the multi-scalar technical, health, social and above all cultural challenges facing the use of 'humanure' for urban agriculture in the context of developed cities, it then acknowledges the incremental nature of successful technology uptake before proposing one possible modest approach for addressing the difficulties implicit in this model through the use of 'urine diversion'",human waste;humanure;niche (demonstration) technology;sewerage systems;urban farming;urine diversion,,"Richardson, A.; Department of Global, Urban and Social Studies, RMIT, Melbourne, Australia; email: anthony.richardson@rmit.edu.au",,,13604813,,,,English,City,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84878197628,1,Australia,Australia,department of global,department of global,19th century;acknowledge;acknowledges;actornetwork;actornetwork approach;agricultural technique;agriculture;approach;attitude towards;attitudes;brief;brief overview;century;challenge facing;challenges;cities;concept;concept paper;context;crucial development;cultural challenge;cultures;developed;development;dichotomous view;difficulties;difficulty implicit;directions;discusses;diversion;england;excreta;excreta humanure;excreta use;fertilisation;focus;health;human;human excreta;humanure;humanure human;implementation;implicit;incremental;incremental nature;model;modest approach;multiscalar;nature;outlines;overview;paper;paper discus;particular focus;possible direction;resource;sanitation;spread;successful technology;suggests;technique;techniques;technology;technology uptake;towards;uptake;urban agriculture;urban farming;urine;urine diversion;use;various technique;views;waste;world,cities;developed;humanure;new world;ordure;thoughts;use;world;world ordure,562

That the transaction transpired under dubious legal grounds and behind closed doors has only made the long-term damage even more gratuitous. A salient example is with movements inspired by Lefebvre's approach to analyzing and acting upon urban processes.

It has recently been granted by the Centre for Education in the Built Environment (CEBE). Through comparative teaching and design methods, this study critically explores the principles of low-tech and high-design carried out in several international workshops led by the author. These cases show how students can rapidly develop key spatial and constructional skills such as: spatial versatility, environmental awareness and collaborative research by doing. Each studio brief consisted of intensive workshops focusing on conceptualisation and fabrication of elementary frameworks by using disused cost-free materials. What is a compact architecture today? What should our design objectives be for a sustainable future? What type of elementary framework should we achieve? For instance, the workshop called 'Nomadic Allotments': http://www.nomadicallotments.co.uk built mobile allotments at Borough Market as part of the International Student Architecture Festival in London 2010. Students learnt on agile fabrication, reuse of junk materials and urban gardening's techniques. We obtained an international prize as the best 'Recycling Project'. The lesson of these serial of workshops lies on the notion of eco-fabrication applied in undergraduate architectural education. The culture of each workshop is ""a learning tool and catalyst for 'smart' design decisions by using less and giving more"".

The lack of security, increased vandalism coupled with low purchasing power of the residents have forced neighborhood grocery stores to close down and move elsewhere, thus making these communities virtual food deserts. Focusing on the low-income, socially disadvantaged population in Missouri, the Innovative Small Farmers' Outreach Program (ISFOP) at Lincoln University Cooperative Extension works with urban gardeners/farmers and residents and assists them in alleviating some of the problems. The goal of ISFOP's urban agriculture component is to improve the management of urban farms and gardens, increase the supply of fresh fruits and vegetables in these communities, and improve the health and well-being of these citizens. The ISFOP staff works one-on-one with the farmers, home gardeners and community leaders and offers them information and education on managing land, growing nutritious fruits and vegetables for home consumption and selling the surplus to make a little extra money.

The relativism of BW scaling also typically prevents distinction of respondents or groups of respondents based on similarities to the study object. A dual-response BW scaling method employed here to obtain an anchored scale allowed comparisons of importance ratings across individuals. Attribute importance ratings and rankings obtained were compared with those from relative BW scaling. Latent class (LC) and hierarchical Bayesian (HB) analyses of individual specific BW choice data were also compared for ability to consider within- and between-respondent choice heterogeneity. Personal interviews with 449 consumers provided data on the importance of 16 food quality attributes of kale produced in peri-urban farming in Kenya. Major findings were that the anchoring model improved individual choice predictions compared with conventional relativistic BW scaling, i.e. was more reliable in measuring consumer preferences, and that HB analysis fitted the data better than LC analysis. HB analysis also successfully obtained individual parameter estimates from sparse data and is thus a promising tool for analysis of BW choices in sensory and consumer-orientated research",anchored best-worst scaling;food quality;hierarchical bayesian estimation;latent class;peri-urban farming,,"Lagerkvist, C.J.; Department of Economics, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, P.O.

The rate of growth of urban farming and its contributions to Lagos state's food supply strategy is worthy of note. In Lagos farming activities are practiced and performed by some able bodied migrants from all parts of the country, who for many reasons could hardly have been absolved by the aggressive urban economy of the city. A close watch on the practitioners reveals a pattern of operation which requires deeper inquiry. A total of 202 urban vegetable farmers were interviewed in four areas of Lagos state to provide primary data for this study. Results from the study showed that an average farmer owns a farm plot of below 120 m by 60 m usually linear and along the expressway, the green vegetable (Celosia argientes) alone constitutes about 97% of what is grown, beds are arranged in sizes of about 1.8 m long by 0.9 m wide and 0.3 m high with furrows in between. The farmers use the simplest local tools, chemical fertilizers, and strategically located irrigation wells. It was also found that the farmers use some part of the vegetables for household consumption, sell others to the local marketers, and contribute their own quota to stem the rising prices of vegetable produce in the local markets. It is therefore imperative on the stakeholders to re-examine the relevance of urban farming in the city and provide support for its growth",farming activities;food security;lagos;nigeria;urban economy;urban farming,,"Lawal, M.

Focusing on the question of urban food security in and around Sierra Leone's capital city, Freetown, this paper explores the proliferation of urban and peri-urban agriculture (UPA) as a response to the rising demand for food and employment. In this context, the paper examines a recent upsurge in cooperative activity associated with UPA in Freetown, drawing upon the knowledge and perceptions of those involved in urban farming associations. In seeking to better understand the associational and livelihood strategies of urban residents in the post-war era, the paper highlights how UPA activities are currently driving a resurgence in community-based cooperation, a development which could play an important role in safeguarding livelihoods and urban food security during a particularly critical point in the country's post-conflict recovery trajectory",associations;food production;freetown;gender;peri-urban;sierra leone;urban;youth,employment;food market;food production;food security;periurban area;urban agriculture;freetown;sierra leone;western area,"Maconachie, R.; Centre for Development Studies, Department of Social and Policy Sciences, University of BathUnited Kingdom; email: r.maconachie@bath.ac.uk",,,02642751,,,,English,Cities,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84859267356,3,United Kingdom;New Zealand;Sierra Leone,United Kingdom,centre for development studies;department of geography;department of geography,centre for development studies,activities;activity;africa;african country;agriculture;agriculture upa;associations;becomes;capital;capital city;centres;challenges;cities;city;civil war;context;cooperation;cooperative;cooperative activity;country;country emerges;country postconflict;countrys;critical point;decade;demand;desperation;development;emerges;employment;energy;energy price;era;examines;explores;face;food;food becomes;food security;freetown;global food;highlights;important role;knowledge;leone;leone capital;leone face;leones;livelihood;livelihood strategy;livelihoods;new challenge;paper;paper examines;paper explores;paper highlight;perceptions;periurban;periurban agriculture;play;point;postconflict;postconflict recovery;postwar;postwar era;prices;proliferation;question;recent upsurge;recovery;recovery trajectory;residents;response;resurgence;riots;role;security;series;sierra;sierra leone;strategies;stream;subsaharan;subsaharan africa;trajectory;understand;upa;upa activity;upsurge;urban centre;urban farming;urban food;urban resident;war;west,associations;food;food security;freetown;leone;postwar;postwar freetown;security;sierra;sierra leone;urban farming;youth,573

Enterprise choice decisions are particularly important in urban farming because of the associated farmland constraints and expectations of abrupt urban expansion. Given its importance in combating food insecurity and generating employment for the urban poor, city planners must begin to take urban farming into consideration in developing city plans. Informed decisions can be meaningful only if the factors that drive urban farmers' enterprise choice decisions are empirically determined. This study identifies some of these factors in urban smallholder farming in Akwa Ibom state, Nigeria. The study was based on farm-level data from 160 randomly selected farmers across the six agricultural zones of the state, and analysed using the multinomial logit model. While marital status and household size were negatively and significantly related to the probability of the farmers choosing pepper over waterleaf, the choice of garden egg over waterleaf was positively related to marital status but negatively related to the sole cropping system. The farmers' level of formal education and farm size were positively and significantly related to the odds of their choosing cassava, maize, pepper or garden egg enterprise instead of waterleaf, perhaps because these other crops are more resource-intensive than waterleaf. Income was, however, negatively and significantly related to the farmers' choice of these other crops instead of waterleaf, perhaps also because, as their income improves, they begin to restrict their urban farming activities. It is hoped that these factors may help to guide city planners with respect to the location of urban settlements where agricultural land could be most usef",enterprise choice;farm enterprise;multinomial logit;nigeria;urban agriculture,hydrophyllaceae;manihot esculenta;zea mays,"Enete, A.A.; Department of Agricultural Economics, University of Nigeria, Nsukka, Nigeria; email: anselmenete@hotmail.com",,,00307270,,,,English,Outlook Agric,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84864000945,3,Nigeria,Nigeria,department of agricultural economics,department of agricultural economics,abrupt;abrupt urban;activities;agricultural land;agricultural zone;akwa;akwa ibom;begin;cassava;choice;choice decision;city;city plan;city planner;consideration;constraints;crops;data;decisions;differ;drive;drive urban;education;egg;egg enterprise;employment;enterprise;enterprise choice;enterprise differ;enterprises;expansion;expectations;factors;farm;farm enterprise;farm size;farmer choice;farmer choosing;farmer enterprise;farmer level;farmers;farming activity;farmland;farmland constraint;farmlevel;farmlevel data;food;food insecurity;formal education;garden;garden egg;guide;guide city;help;household;household size;ibom;ibom state;identifies;importance;improves;income;income improves;insecurity;land;level;location;logit;logit model;maize;marital;marital status;meaningful;model;multinomial;multinomial logit;nigeria;odds;pepper;planners;plans;probability;quality;quantity;requirement quantity;requirements;resource;resource requirement;resourceintensive;respect;restrict;settlements;size;smallholder;smallholder farming;sole;sole cropping;state;status;study;study identifies;system;timing;urban expansion;urban farmer;urban farming;urban settlement;urban smallholder;usef;waterleaf;zones,akwa;akwa ibom;choice;choice decision;decisions;empirical evidence;enterprise;enterprise choice;evidence;food;food production;ibom;ibom state;nigeria;production;state;urban food,575

UA can be understood through two phenomena integral to the capitalist mode of production: capital centralisation and rent. Centralisation explains why capitalist agriculture industrialises, while rent provides a theoretical framework for understanding how social and spatial relations structure urban land uses. Urban farming can occupy niches of the capitalist marketplace; however, its prospects for replacing large-scale agriculture and providing similar use-values are limited. Its expansion is bounded by rising land values expressed in rent, as Detroit's urban farm, Markham's food belt, Los Angeles's community garden, and initiatives in other cities demonstrate. The key tasks for political ecologists are two-fold: situating UA within capital's drive to accumulate and proposing strategic perspectives that challenge these inherent tendencies",capital centralisation;community gardens;localism;political ecology;political economy;rent;urban agriculture,,"Sharzer, G.",,,14654466,,,,English,Hist Mater,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84881118698,1,,,,,accumulate;agriculture;agriculture industrialises;agriculture ua;angeless;angeless community;belt;capital;capital centralisation;capital drive;capitalist;capitalist agriculture;capitalist marketplace;capitalist mode;capitals;centralisation;centralisation explains;challenge;cities;city demonstrate;community;community garden;demonstrate;detroit urban;detroits;drive;ecologists;ethical production;expansion;explains;farm;food;food belt;framework;garden;global north;industrialises;inherent;inherent tendency;initiatives;key;key task;land;land value;largescale;largescale agriculture;los;los angeless;malnutrition;marketplace;markhams;mode;niches;north;occupy;occupy niche;overcome;overcome malnutrition;perspectives;phenomena;political ecologist;production;production capital;promote;prospects;relation structure;relations;rent;similar usevalues;spatial relation;strategic perspective;structure;structure urban;tasks;tendencies;theoretical framework;twofold;twofold situating;ua;understood;urban agriculture;urban farm;urban farming;urban land;uses;usevalues;values;way,agriculture;critique;economy;localist;political economy;urban agriculture,579

This crisis, however, has not only yielded the massive devaluation of real estate that has so often been noted; it has also yielded an explosive production of seemingly valueless urban property that has facilitated the imagination and practice of alternative urbanisms. The first sustained study of Detroit's alternative urban cultures, The Unreal Estate Guide to Detroit initiates a new focus on Detroit as a site not only of urban crisis but also of urban possibility. The Guide documents art and curatorial practices, community and guerilla gardens, urban farming and forestry, cultural platforms, living archives, evangelical missions, temporary public spaces, intentional communities, furtive monuments, outsider architecture, and other work made possible by the ready availability of urban space in Detroit. The Guide poses these spaces as ""unreal estate"": urban territory that has slipped through the free- market economy and entered other regimes of value, other contexts of meaning, and other systems of use. The appropriation of this territory in Detroit, the Guide suggests, offers new perspectives on what a city is and can be, especially in a time of urban crisis.

After debating energy efficiency for the last decade, the focus has shifted to include further resources and material efficiency. In this context, urban farming has emerged as a valid urban design strategy, where food is produced and consumed locally within city boundaries, turning disused sites and underutilized public space into productive urban landscapes and community gardens. Furthermore, such agricultural activities allow for effective composting of organic waste, returning nutrients to the soil and improving biodiversity in the urban environment. Urban farming and resource recovery will help to feed the 9 billion by 2050 (predicted population growth, UN-Habitat forecast 2009). This chapter reports on best practice of urban design principles in regard to materials flow, material recovery, adaptive re-use of entire building elements and components (“design for disassembly” prefabrication of modular building components), and other relevant strategies to implement zero waste by avoiding waste creation, reducing wasteful consumption and changing behavior in the design and construction sectors. The chapter touches on two important issues in regard to the rapid depletion of the world’s natural resources: the built environment and the education of architects and designers (both topics of further research). The construction and demolition (C&D) sector: Prefabricated multi-story buildings for inner city living can set new benchmarks for minimizing construction wastage and for modular onsite assembly. Today, the C&D sector is one of the main producers of waste; it does not engage enough with waste minimization, waste avoidance and recycling. Education and research: It is still unclear how best to introduce a holistic understanding of these challenges and to better teach practical and affordable solutions to architects, urban designers, industrial designers, and so on. How must urban development and construction change and evolve to automatically embed sustainability in the way we design, build, operate, maintain and renew/recycle cities? One of the findings of this chapter is that embedding zero waste requires strong industry leadership, new policies and effective education curricula, as well as raising awareness (through research and education) and refocusing research agendas to bring about attitudinal change and the reduction of wasteful consumption",adaptive re-use of buildings;changing behavior;closed loop urban metabolism;material flow;product stewardship;recycling and reuse;reducing consumption;resource recovery;urban waste streams;waste avoidance;zero waste concept,biodiversity;building components;construction industry;ecodesign;energy efficiency;industrial research;modular construction;population statistics;recycling;structural design;sustainable development;adaptive re use;changing behavior;material flow;product stewardship;reducing consumption;resource recovery;urban metabolisms;urban wastes;waste avoidance;zero waste;urban growth,"Lehmann, S.; Zero Waste SA Research Centre for Sustainable Design and Behaviour (sd+b), University of South AustraliaAustralia",,Apple Academic Press,,9781466559363; 9781926895246,,,English,Sustainable Solid Waste Management,Book Chapter,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84900646189,1,Australia,Australia,zero waste sa research centre for sustainable design and behaviour (sd+b),zero waste sa research centre for sustainable design and behaviour (sd+b),activities;adaptive reuse;affordable solution;agendas;agricultural activity;architects;attitudinal change;avoidance;awareness;behavior;benchmarks;biodiversity;boundaries;bring;build;building;building component;building element;buildings;built;cd;cd sector;challenges;change;chapter;chapter report;chapter touch;cities;city;city boundary;city living;community;community garden;component “design;components;construction;construction change;construction sector;construction wastage;consumption;context;creation;curricula;decade;demolition;demolition cd;depletion;design;design principle;design strategy;designers;development;disassembly”;disassembly” prefabrication;education;education curriculum;effective composting;effective education;efficiency;elements;embed;energy;energy efficiency;engage;entire building;environment;evolve;feed;findings;flow;focus;food;forecast;gardens;growth;help;holistic understanding;implement;implement zero;important issue;include;industrial designers;industry;industry leadership;inner;inner city;introduce;issues;landscapes;last decade;leadership;living;main producer;maintain;material;material efficiency;material flow;material recovery;materials;minimization;modular;modular building;modular onsite;multistory;multistory building;natural resource;new benchmark;new policy;nutrients;onsite;onsite assembly;operate;organic waste;policies;population;population growth;practice;prefabrication;principles;producers;productive urban;public;public space;rapid depletion;recovery;reduction;regard;relevant;relevant strategy;renewrecycle;renewrecycle city;reports;research;research agenda;resource;resource recovery;resources;reuse;sector;sectors;set;sites;soil;solutions;space;strategies;strategy;strong industry;supply;sustainability;teach;today;topics;touches;underutilized public;unhabitat;unhabitat forecast;urban design;urban designers;urban development;urban environment;urban farming;urban landscape;urgent;urgent challenge;valid urban;wastage;waste;waste avoidance;waste creation;waste minimization;wasteful;wasteful consumption;water;way;world’s;zero;“design,consumption;development;flows;material;material flow;principles;streams;sustainable consumption;urban development;urban material;waste;waste stream;zero,583

Conventional water treatment is expensive, requires advanced technology and often breaks down in less developed countries so low cost interventions are needed. Field and laboratory based trials were carried out in order to investigate the effect of the natural coagulant Moringa oleifera (MO) seed extracts in reducing helminh eggs and turbidity in irrigation water, turbid water, wastewater and tap water. In medium to high turbid water MO extracts were effective in reducing the number of helminth eggs by 94-99.5% to 1-2 eggs per litre and the turbidity to 7-11 NTU which is an 85-96% reduction. MO is readily available in many tropical countries and can be used by farmers to treat high turbid water for irrigation, however, additional improvements of water quality, e.g. by sand filtration, is suggested to meet the guideline value of ≤1 helminth egg per litre and a turbidity of ≤2 NTU as recommended by the World Health Organization and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for water intended for irrigation. A positive correlation was established between reduction in turbidity and helminth eggs in irrigation water, turbid water and wastewater treated with MO. This indicates that helminth eggs attach to suspended particles and/or flocs facilitated by MO in the water, and that turbidity and helminth eggs are reduced with the settling flocs. However, more experiments with water samples containing naturally occurring helminth eggs are needed to establish whether turbidity can be used as a proxy for helminth eggs",helminth eggs;low quality water treatment;moringa oleifera;turbidity;urban vegetable farming,costs;cultivation;environmental protection agency;extraction;health risks;irrigation;turbidity;wastewater treatment;water filtration;water quality;conventional water treatment;helminth eggs;less developed countries;low quality water treatments;moringa oleifera;u.s. environmental protection agency;urban vegetable farmings;world health organization;water treatment;moringa oleifera extract;tap water;water;advanced technology;coagulation;crop production;developing world;dicotyledon;drinking water;egg;eukaryote;health risk;irrigation system;plant extract;seed;streamwater;turbidity;wastewater;water pollution;water treatment;world health organization;article;controlled study;helminth;irrigation (agriculture);parasite clearance;plant seed;priority journal;turbidity;waste water;waste water management;water quality;ghana;moringa oleifera;vermes,"Dalsgaard, A.; Department of Veterinary Disease Biology, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Groennegaardsvej 15, DK-1870 Frederiksberg C, Denmark; email: ad@life.ku.dk",,Elsevier Ltd,00431354,,WATRA,22546609.0,English,Water Res,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84861330467,7,Denmark;Ghana,Denmark,department of veterinary disease biology;international water management institute;department of international health;department of chemistry,department of veterinary disease biology,additional improvement;advanced technology;agency;andor;andor floc;attach;breaks;coagulant;coagulant moringa;conventional water;correlation;cost;cost intervention;countries;crop;crop production;developed;developed country;dugouts;e;effect;egg;egg attach;eggs;environmental protection;experiments;extracts;farmers;field;filtration;flocs;g;ghana;guideline;guideline value;health;health organization;health risk;helminh;helminh egg;helminth;helminth egg;helminth parasite;high turbid;improvements;indicates;interventions;investigate;irrigation;irrigation water;laboratory;litre;low cost;medium;meet;mo;mo extract;moringa;moringa oleifera;natural coagulant;ntu;number;oleifera;oleifera mo;order;organization;parasite;parasite egg;particle andor;particles;positive correlation;production;protection;protection agency;proxy;quality;reduction;represent;represent health;risks;s;samples;sand;sand filtration;seed;seed extract;source;streams;tap;tap water;technology;treat;treatment;trials;tropical country;turbid;turbid water;turbidity;u;urban farming;used water;value;wastewater;water;water mo;water quality;water represent;water sample;water source;water treatment;world;world health;≤1;≤2;≤2 ntu,egg;egg number;extracts;helminth;helminth egg;irrigation;irrigation water;moringa;moringa oleifera;numbers;oleifera;oleifera seed;seed;seed extract;turbidity;use;water,584

It contributes to food security, food safety, better environmental quality and greenery for a nation especially the urban area. Due to the high land value in urban area, infrastructure or utility reserved lands were seen to be necessary to be identified with the suitability for farming purpose. This paper is dealing with the study on suitability of urban farming in the reserved lands from the perspective of planners, urban farmers, and officers from land offices and land owners. Besides, the related laws and statutory plans were also been studied.

However, the literature on land tenure focuses on gaining access to land for housing, whereas farming, which is highly visible in the urban landscape of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, requires farmers to negotiate their access in ways distinct from housing. A close examination of four open-space farms in Dar es Salaam reveals that there are different methods of gaining access to land for farming as opposed to housing. Additionally, theorising this access reveals that the landowners who allow farmers on their land for food production also derive benefits.

Cuba was forced by historical circumstances to be one of the pioneers in the massive application of these techniques. After the demise of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s, Cuba was left without access to external support needed to carry on with industrial agriculture. The economic crisis led the country to reconsider their former models of resource management. Cuba retooled its agricultural programs to focus on urban agriculture--sustainable, ecologically sound farming close to densely populated areas. Food now takes far less time to get to the people, who are now better nourished because they have easier access to whole foods. Moreover, urban farming has become a source of national pride--Cuba has one of the best urban agriculture programs in the world, with a thousand-fold increase in urban agricultural output since 1994. Sinan Koont has spent the last several years researching urban agriculture in Cuba, including field work at many sustainable farms on the island. He tells the story of why and how Cuba was able to turn to urban food production on a large scale with minimal use of chemicals, petroleum, and machinery, and of the successes it achieved--along with the continuing difficulties it still faces in reducing its need for food imports",,,"Koont, S.; Economics Department, Dickinson College, Carlisle, PA, United States",,University Press of Florida,,0813037573; 9780813037578,,,English,Sustainable Urban Agric in Cuba,Book,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84894955032,1,United States,United States,economics department,economics department,access;agricultural output;agricultural program;agriculture;agriculture program;agroecological technique;application;areas;attention;become;carry;chemicals;circumstances;consequences;costs;country;crisis;cuba;demise;difficulties;economic crisis;external support;farms;field;field work;focus;food;food import;food production;foods;former model;historical circumstance;imports;increase;industrial agriculture;input;input cost;island;koont;large scale;largescale;le time;left;machinery;management;massive application;minimal;minimal use;models;moreover;national pridecuba;need;objectionable consequence;output;people;petroleum;pioneers;populated area;pridecuba;production;programs;reconsider;resource;resource management;scale;scrutiny;several year;sinan;sinan koont;sound;sound farming;source;soviet union;spent;story;successes;support;sustainable farm;techniques;tells;thousandfold;thousandfold increase;time;turn;union;urban agriculture;urban farming;urban food;use;whole food;work;world;years,agriculture;cuba;urban agriculture,589

Therefore, horizontal flows of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) as well as leaching losses of mineral N and P were measured over 2 years in three representative agricultural production systems of Kabul. These comprised 21 gardens and 18 fields dedicated to vegetable farming, cereal farming, and table-grape production (vineyards). Across sites (fields and gardens) biennial inputs averaged 375kg N ha -1, 155kg P ha -1, 145kg K ha -1, and 15kg C ha -1 while with harvests 305kg N ha -1, 40kg P ha -1, 330kg K ha -1, and 7kg C ha -1 were removed. In vegetable gardens, biennial net balances were 80kg N ha -1, 75kg P ha -1, -205kg K ha -1, and 4kg C ha -1, whereas in cereal farming biennial horizontal balances amounted to -155kg N ha -1, 20kg P ha -1, -355kg K ha -1, and 5kg C ha -1. In vineyards, corresponding values were 295kg N ha -1, 235kg P ha -1, 5kg K ha -1, and 3kg C ha -1. Annual leaching losses in two selected vegetable gardens varied from 70 to 205kg N ha -1 and from 5 to 10kg P ha -1. Night soil and irrigation water were the major sources among the applied nutrient inputs in all studied farming systems, contributing on average 12% and 25% to total N, 22% and 12% to total P, 41% and 53% to total K, and 79% and 10% to total C, respectively.

The aim of the paper is to suggest that ""re-politicisation"" of environmental politics is possible, taking into account the political practices emerging in urban space. The attachment to place materiality can, by means of common practices, make evident forgotten or ignored environmental relations; and it can make them a ""public issue"". These kinds of practices relay upon the association of humans and non-humans, as crucial actors in the political constitution of urban space.

Due to lack of adequate training among other factors, farmers make sub-optimal profit margins and produce vegetables which are dangerous to human health due to misuse of agrochemicals. This study was embarked upon for a period of three months, to build the capacity of vegetable farmers on how to produce safe and profitable vegetables using good agricultural practices (GAP) and improved production packages with minimal use of appropriate agro-chemicals. Two groups of 60 women vegetable farmers in Odogbo army barrack of the city were involved. Farmers' production practices and associated problems were documented through Focus Group Discussion (FGD). Innovative capacity building strategies building on farmers' resources and on-farm demonstration (OFAD) in the form of urban producers' field school (UPFS) focusing on the three most important vegetables - Corchorus, Celosia and Amaranthus - to the farmers was set up to address the problems. Weekly trainings were conducted and farmers were encouraged to apply the knowledge gained on their private farms. Thirty farmers each from participating and non-participating farmers were randomly selected to compare their yield, quality of harvest and economic returns after the training. Data were analyzed using t-test. There was significant difference (p<0.05) between the yield obtained by participating and non-participating farmers. Economic gains of the participating farmers also increased by 300% on the average due to improved quality of produce and higher market price.

Design, construction, and maintenance of buildings have a tremendous impact on the environment and the natural resources. All around the world, a huge amount of buildings are being constructed with many more to be done. The challenge will be to build them smart with a minimal usage of non-renewable energy, minimal production of pollution, and minimal cost of energy dollars. Other important issues in building include increasing the comfort, health, and safety of people who live and work in them. Indeed, buildings consume many of the natural resources and are responsible for many problems. Now, in the 21st century, people are slowly beginning to realize the necessity of green architecture where new aspects and technologies started to emerge in terms of green buildings such as green walls which are considered a new prospect for the phenomenon of urban heat island and energy conservation aspects [1,5]. This research will display the meanings, the advantages and the techniques of the living wall as a part of the sustainable strategy for the urban environment. The Green vertical surfaces can contribute significant environmental, social and economic benefits to the built environment. moreover the research will display why this emerging technology should be considered as a valuable part of the design process for addressing climate change and energy crisis. The living wall could also function for urban agriculture, urban gardening, or for its beauty as art. It is sometimes built indoors to help alleviate sick building syndrome. Living walls are particularly suitable for cities, as they allow good use of available vertical surface areas. They are also suitable in arid areas, as the circulating water on a vertical wall is less likely to evaporate than in horizontal gardens. Finally, the research will conclude with several recommendations for the using of living walls technique which suits the arid climate as a part of sustainable strategy for the urban environment",bio walls;climatic change;vertical vegetations,agriculture;buildings;climate change;energy policy;historic preservation;indoor air pollution;intelligent buildings;natural resources;sustainable development;urban planning;bio walls;climatic changes;emerging technologies;green architectures;impact on the environment;non-renewable energy;sick building syndrome;sustainable strategies;walls (structural partitions),"Sheweka, S.; Architecture Department, British University in Egypt, Cairo, Egypt; email: Samar.sheweka@bue.edu.eg",,Elsevier Ltd,18766102,,,,English,Energy Procedia,Conference Paper,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-79960224638,2,Egypt,Egypt,architecture department,architecture department,21st century;advantages;agriculture;alleviate;alleviate sick;amount;architecture;areas;arid;arid area;arid climate;art;aspect;aspects;beauty;benefits;build;building;building consume;building syndrome;buildings;built;century;challenge;change;choice;cities;climate;climate change;comfort;conclude;conscious choice;conservation;conservation aspect;construction;consume;contribute;cost;crisis;design;design process;display;dollars;economic benefit;emerge;energy;energy conservation;energy crisis;energy dollar;environment;evaporate;function;gardening;gardens;good use;green architecture;green building;green vertical;green wall;health;heat;heat island;help;horizontal;horizontal garden;huge amount;impact;important issue;include;indoors;island;issues;life;living;maintenance;many problem;meanings;minimal;minimal cost;minimal production;minimal usage;moreover;natural resource;necessity;need;new aspect;new prospect;nonrenewable energy;part;people;phenomenon;pollution;problems;process;production;prospect;recommendations;research;resources;safety;several recommendation;sick;sick building;smart;societies;strategy;suits;surface;surface area;surfaces;sustainable strategy;sustainable way;switch;syndrome;technique;techniques;technologies;technology;terms;tremendous impact;urban agriculture;urban environment;urban gardening;urban heat;usage;use;valuable part;vertical surface;vertical wall;wall;wall technique;walls;water;way;work;world,approach;environment;healthy urban;living;urban environment;walls,597

Reducing the carbon footprint typically involves scrutinizing the heating, cooling and light equipment. Reducing the water footprint invariably calls for the use of low-flow equipment, greywater systems and xeriscapes. Mitigating stormwater runoff defaults to the incorporation of rain gardens, bio-swales and green roofs. And, eradicating food deserts usually relies on the planning of farmers' markets and community gardens. Missing is the one solution that addresses all four of these concerns - agrarian urban architecture. Planting green roofs, rain gardens, bioswales and public spaces with fruits and vegetables transforms urban rainwater from a stormwater management problem to a vital resource for community gardens and urban CSA (community supported agriculture) farms that are widely distributed throughout the urban area, which work to eliminate food deserts. Diverting rainwater away from measures that promote evaporation towards measures that produce food reduces the water footprint. And, producing food locally eliminates the carbon footprint associated with transporting food long distances. The only real challenge is getting this information into the hands of the people who can best effect a change - emerging planners, architects and engineers. This paper recounts a two-year effort to teach agrarian urban architecture by incorporate farming into a multidisciplinary design studio for planning, architecture and engineering students at the University of North Carolina Charlotte.

Whether in the countryside or in town, such gardens represent distinct microenvironments within a larger landscape, in which they are well integrated. It has been found that gardens provide different benefits to ecosystems and people. They offer refuge to wild flora and fauna and conserve high levels of inter- and intra-specific plant genetic diversity by preserving local or traditional (heritage) species. They become an important social and cultural space where knowledge related to plants and agricultural practices is kept and transmitted, at the same time providing recreational opportunities. In rich as well as in poor countries these gardens generate household income by producing food for subsistence or small-scale marketing. When managed non intensively, they become a valid example of sustainable land-use systems.

This paper explores the social and cultural effects of urban gardening in the greater Cleveland area. Gardening is shown to have a multitude of motivating factors, including economic, environmental, political, social, and nutritional. While analyzing the impact that gardens have on community building, identity, and food security, some authors claim that the gardeners themselves are preoccupied with the economic impact of their actions. Perversely, this leads readers to the conclusion that poor people or people of color are only interested in gardening for its dollar value. Following this argument, more affluent gardeners have the security to ignore the economic impact and focus only on furthering an environmentalist agenda. Such authors presume that utilitarian function and environmentalist ideology are mutually exclusive, but my own fieldwork showed that many gardeners actively combine these ideas. This paper intends to convey the complexity of use, function, and intent in these communal spaces, filling an existing gap in our understanding of their social impa",environmental history;ethnography;urban gardens,cultural relations;economic impact;environmental factor;environmental history;food security;garden;nutrition;political relations;social impact;urban area;cleveland [ohio];ohio;united states,"Flachs, A.; Oberlin College, OH, United States; email: aflachs@gmail.com",,,10767975,,,,English,Electron Green J,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78149239317,1,United States,United States,oberlin college,oberlin college,actions;affluent;affluent gardener;agenda;area;argument;author claim;author presume;authors;benefits;building;claim;cleveland;cleveland area;color;combine;communal;communal space;community;community building;community garden;complexity;conclusion;convey;cultural effect;development;dollar;dollar value;economic impact;effects;environmentalist;environmentalist agenda;environmentalist ideology;explores;factors;fieldwork;focus;food;food security;function;gap;garden remain;gardeners;gardening;gardens;green space;healthy eating;ideas;identity;ideology;ignore;impa;impact;intent;lead reader;leads;many gardener;multitude;paper;paper explores;people;poor people;presume;readers;remain;remain le;security;social impa;social impact;space;space development;spaces;urban gardening;use;utilitarian function;value,area;cleveland;cleveland area;community;community garden;food;gardens;impact;social impact;thought,601

The practice has sustained livelihood of the urban and peri-urban low income dwellers in developing countries for many years. Its popularity among the urban low income is largely due to lack of formal jobs and as a means of adding up to household income. There is increasing need to sustainably manage urban farming in developing nations in recent times. Population increase due to rural-urban migration and natural, coupled with infrastructure developments are competing with urban farming for available space and scarce resources such as water for irrigation. Lack of reliable data on the extent of urban/peri-urban areas being used for farming has affected developing sustainable policies to manage urban farming in Accra. Using ground based survey methods to map the urban farmlands are inherently problematic and prohibitively expensive. This has influenced accurate assessment of the future role of urban farming in enhancing food security. Remote sensing, however, allows areas being used as urban farmlands to be rapidly established at relatively low cost.

This article focuses on crop production on larger open spaces in cities of sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and investigates the sustainability and dynamics of this type of land use, which is common on undeveloped plots particularly in lowlands, such as in inland valleys, or along urban streams or drains. An adapted version of the Framework for Evaluating Sustainable Land Management (FESLM) developed by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) was used to assess the sustainability of urban agriculture. As an example for dynamics, the spatio-temporal changes of open-space agriculture in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, are analyzed for the period from 1992 to 2005, and compared with data from other cities. Crop production on urban open spaces appears as a market-driven, highly productive and profitable phenomenon. However, it is often constrained by tenure insecurity and non-agricultural land demands. Also, the common use of polluted water limits the official support of irrigated urban farming. However, despite these constraints, the phenomenon of urban farming appears persistent and resilient to its changing environment, although individual farmers might have to shift to other sites when their plots are needed for construction. Open-space vegetable production in urban areas is a dynamic, viable and largely sustainable livelihood strategy, especially for poor urban dwellers. Spatio-temporal analysis shows that it is not a short-lived or transitional phenomenon-probably as long as it can maintain its comparative market advantage. However, its informal nature and resulting lack of political recognition need to be addressed",dynamic;sub-saharan africa;sustainability;urban agriculture;vegetables;wastewater irrigation,,"Drechsel, P.; International Water Management Institute (IWMI), P.O.

Most (94 %) of the farmers had kept livestock for prolonged periods mainly for income generation (97 %) and domestic consumption (59 %). These data show that livestock keeping was popular and could be harnessed to increase food security, although the farmers kept mainly low-producing indigenous cattle (98 %) which were grazed on unutilised land. The main production constraints mentioned by farmers included diseases (100 %), poor fertility (68 %) and lack of feed (56 %). The diseases varied with species of ruminants and included lumpy skin disease (71 %), diarrhoea (65 %) and helminthosis (62 %).

This article reviews empirical data from equatorial Africa that touch on this assertion, updating the work on the subject published in the mid-1990s. Research, largely from East Africa but also including Cameroon in West Central Africa, appearing in several recent and currently emerging publications is assessed and compared. The article attempts to quantify the extent of urban agriculture in several cities based on the proportion of urban households involved, and assesses its statistical and qualitative relationship to urban food and nutrition security as well as its complex relationship to poverty. The role of urban agriculture in closing eco-cycles is discussed in important new data from three cities on how organic solid waste is, or is not, being re-used. Recent efforts in policy-making in three East African cities are reviewed, prior to making a policy analysis. The article concludes that the scale and extent of urban agriculture is increasing with, or perhaps in excess of, urban growth according to available data, and that it is beneficial to human health as well as to hunger and poverty alleviation. Urban livestock production and land availability are particularly beneficial. Poverty alleviation through urban agriculture could be both better understood and supported by appropriate policy measures, since better-off households are currently benefiting more from urban agriculture than the majority of poor households.

In total, 102 stool specimens were analysed during a cross-sectional parasitological survey in urban farming communities in Cote d'Ivoire. Five SAF-preserved faecal samples were prepared from each specimen and forwarded to the participating reference laboratories, processed and examined under a microscope adhering to a standard operating procedure (SOP). Schistosoma mansoni (cumulative prevalence: 51.0%) and hookworm (cumulative prevalence: 39.2%) were the predominant helminths. There was excellent agreement (γ > 0.8; p < 0.001) among the reference laboratories for the diagnosis of S. mansoni, hookworm, Trichuris trichiura and Ascaris lumbricoides. Moderate agreement (γ = 0.54) was found for Hymenolepis nana, and lesser agreement was observed for other, less prevalent helminths. The predominant intestinal protozoa were Entamoeba coli (median prevalence: 67.6%), Blastocystis hominis (median prevalence: 55.9%) and Entamoeba histolytica/Entamoeba dispar (median prevalence: 47.1%). Substantial agreement among reference laboratories was found for E. coli (γ = 0.69), but only fair or moderate agreement was found for other Entamoeba species, Giardia intestinalis and Chilomastix mesnili. There was only poor agreement for B. hominis, Isospora belli and Trichomonas intestinalis. In conclusion, although common helminths were reliably diagnosed by European reference laboratories, there was only moderate agreement between centres for pathogenic intestinal protozoa.

The produce from major market and those, which irrigated by water supplied by approved water authority, were also examined. Results have indicated that despite the wastewater used for irrigation being treated, produce from the irrigated area have shown high level of pollution threatening people's health.

This study was undertaken to determine the prevalence of endoparasites in sheep and goats kept by farmers in Kisumu Municipality, Kenya. Faecal samples were collected from 66 sheep and 60 goats, from different areas in the municipality. The helminth and coccidia species were identified and the level of infection compared between age, sex, body condition and area of origin. The prevalence of various types of parasites in sheep and goats were respectively: strongyles 80%, 90%; Strongyloides spp 5%, 13%; Trichuris spp 0%, 2%; Fasciola spp 37%, 36%; Paramphistomum spp 30%, 12%; Moniezia spp 21%, 16%; Coccidia 35%, 48%; Entamoeba spp 87%, 77%; Balantidium coli 2%, 3%; and Giardia spp 10%, 10%. Majority of animals excreted either 2 or 3 parasite types, while only a few sheep had 4 different parasite types. A relatively higher number of animals had heavy infections with strongyles (mean EPGs of 1253 and 1108 in sheep and goats, respectively), while for other helminths and coccidia most animals had light infections. Although the adults had higher levels of infections with trematodes, young animals had higher infections of the other types of parasites. Apart from trematodes and coccidia, male animals had higher prevalence and intensity of the other parasites. Sheep with poor body condition were significantly associated with higher mean EPGs of strongyles while in goats it was Moniezia spp. The association between the prevalence and intensity of the parasites and the independent factors are discussed. The occurrence of parasites with zoonotic significance (Fasciola spp, Entamoeba spp, Balantidium coli, and Giardia spp) is also discussed in the light of livestock farming in urban are",goats;kisumu;parasites;sheep;urban and peri-urban farming;zoonoses,animalia;balantidium;balantidium coli;bovidae;capra hircus;coccidia;entamoeba;fasciola;giardia;moniezia;ovis aries;paramphistomum;strongyles;strongyloides;trematoda;trichuris;vermes,"Kanyari, P.

Rising energy costs and expected declines in oil production are not the only causes: oil- And gas-based fertilizers and pesticides have also depleted the world's soil fertility. The solution, they claim, lies in localizing food production at the regional scale and shifting to organic farming methods that revive soils and conserve water.1 Growing greener cities thus requires growing more of what we eat locally and regionally. Decisions and actions at the level of individual households and firms will help transform markets for food. Yet collective initiatives are arguably even more significant, as they will enable the effective management of the broader restructuring of food systems. Herein lies a vital role for community and regional planners, who must evolve new forms of urbanism to sustain metropolitan societies in the third millennium. Planning for sustainable food supply takes different forms-and has different implications-in different parts of metropolitan America. Developing sustainable food-sheds means something different in downtown, ghetto, and suburban environments, and in high-wealth versus low-wealth communities. As in all facets of urbanism, tackling the problems and opportunities of sustainable food supply in cities and regions requires a diversified set of planning strategies that are applied appropriately in context. This chapter surveys debates about regional food systems, especially urban farming and its relationship to community and economic development. It uses the greater Philadelphia area's emerging urban agriculture sector as a case study exploring the challenges, opportunities, and emerging best practices for U.S. cities and regions. As featured in the multimedia project Edens Lost&Found, the city is home to groundbreaking farms on sites from brownfields to greenfields. More ephemeral experiments in inner city agriculture and aquaculture offer an opportu nity to explore ambitious ideas and market failures that can promote better understanding of how to make urban farming viable. In addition to these producers, Philadelphia institutions are building a robust regional infrastructure of distribution, processing, and marketing of food grown in the greater Delaware Valley region. Finally, a variety of public health, education, community gardening, open space preservation, and stormwater management initiatives in the city and region raise important questions about the role of urban farming in connecting environmental planning and community and economic development in an era of climate change and shifting energy use.

Raised beds were tested for lead and the results showed that the lead concentration increased from an initial range of 150±40 μg/g to an average of 336 μg/g over 4 years. The percent distribution of lead in the fine grain soil (<100 μm) and the trace metal signature of the raised beds support the conclusion that the mechanism of recontamination is wind-transported particles. Scanning electron microscopy and sequential extraction were used to characterize the speciation of lead, and the trace metal signature of the fine grain soil in both gardens and raised gardening beds is characteristic of lead-based paint. This study demonstrates that raised beds are a limited exposure reduction method and require maintenance to achieve exposure reduction goals. An exposure model was developed based on a suite of parameters that combine relevant values from the literature with site-specific quantification of exposure pathways. This model suggests that consumption of homegrown produce accounts for only 3% of children's daily exposure of lead while ingestion of fine grained soil (<100 μm) accounts for 82% of the daily exposure. This study indicates that urban lead remediation on a yard-by-yard scale requires constant maintenance and that remediation may need to occur on a neighborhood-wide scale",exposure;garden soil;lead;remediation;urban,"lead;trace metal;child health;extraction method;garden;lead;neighborhood;pollution exposure;remediation;scanning electron microscopy;soil pollution;speciation (chemistry);article;chemical analysis;concentration (parameters);contamination;environmental exposure;gardening;grain;nonhuman;priority journal;scanning electron microscope;urban area;wind;x ray fluorescence;air pollutants;biodegradation, environmental;environmental monitoring;gardening;lead;models, theoretical;plants;soil;soil pollutants;urbanization;water pollutants, chemical;wind;north america;united states","Clark, H.F.; Department of Geosciences, Wellesley College, Wellesley, MA 02481, United States; email: heather.clark@yale.edu",,,00139351,,ENVRA,18456252.0,English,Environ Res,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-44649143842,3,United States,United States,department of geosciences,department of geosciences,accounts;achieve;achieve exposure;action;action limit;areas;backyard;bed support;beds;characterize;characterizes;childrens;combine;combine relevant;communities;concentration;conclusion;constant maintenance;consumption;contamination;daily exposure;demonstrates;developed;distribution;dorchester;electron;electron microscopy;environmental lead;epa;epa action;exposure;exposure model;exposure pathway;exposure reduction;extraction;fine;fine grain;fluorescence;fortyone;fortyone backyard;gardening;gardening bed;gardens;goals;grain;grain soil;homegrown;homegrown produce;human;human exposure;indicates;ingestion;initial range;lead;lead concentration;lead contamination;lead level;lead remediation;levels;limit;limited exposure;literature;local recontamination;ma;maintenance;mechanism;metal;metal signature;method;microscopy;model;model suggests;need;occur;paint;parameters;particles;pathway;pathways;percent;percent distribution;prevalent;produce;produce account;promote;promote urban;quantification;range;recontamination;reduction;reduction goal;reduction method;relevant;relevant value;remediation;require;require maintenance;results;roxbury;scale;sequential extraction;signature;significant sink;sink;sitespecific;sitespecific quantification;situ;situ exposure;soil;soil μm;speciation;study;study characterizes;study demonstrates;study indicates;suggests;suite;support;trace;trace metal;u epa;urban area;urban gardening;urban lead;usa;values;xray;xray fluorescence;yardbyyard;year;years;μgg;μm;μm account,design;exposure;garden lead;gardens;implications;lead;lead exposure;mechanisms;recontamination;recontamination mechanisms;remediation;remediation design;urban garden,626

A study was conducted to investigate effect of these treatments on reproductive performance. Fifty one Nili-Ravi buffaloes were monitored from parturition up to 150 days postpartum through rectal examination. Data on milk yield, body condition score (BCS) and reproductive parameters were recorded weekly. Postpartum ovulation interval (POI) was determined by presence of an ovulation depression or a very soft corpus luteum haemorrhagicum and was confirmed through milk progesterone levels (MPL). Suckling was used to stimulate milk let down, and where the calf had died, injection of oxytocin was resorted to. Milk samples were analyzed for MPL using radioimmunoassay (RIA) and fat; and milk yield was converted to 4% fat corrected milk (FCM). The mean postpartum uterine involution length (PUI) was 34.30 ± 1.33 days. Mean POI was 59.37 ± 4.76 days and mean postpartum estrus interval (PEI) was 69.03 ± 6.03 days. Suckling period averaged 26.40 ± 5.57 days and correlated with POI (r = 0.19, P < 0.01) and PEI (r = 0.23, P < 0.01). POI was shortest in buffaloes suckled for one month (P < 0.05). Oxytocin was used with a mean dosage of 7.50 IU, delaying placental expulsion time (PET) and POI but shortening PEI. BCS shortened PET, POI and PEI (P < 0.01). Mean FCM was 14.50 ± 0.20, ranging from 2 to 35 kg/d; and was higher in estrus group; correlating positively with POI (r = 0.31, P < 0.01). MPL were 1.37 ± 0.17 ng/ml and increased after ovulation, remaining greater than 1.5 ng/ml from Day 4 to 14 of the estrus cycle, followed by a rapid decline up to next estrus. BCS in buffaloes resuming oestrus was constantly higher than those failing to resume ovarian cyclicity. Live weight, prepartum was 510.0 ± 5.9 kg with a loss of 3.7 ± 2.12 kg, 30 days postpartum. The present study suggests a lower reproductive efficiency of dairy buffaloes under the peri-urban farming system reflected by ovarian cyclicity in 68.63% buffaloes within 150 days postpartum and silent estrus in 51.5% of the cases. Increasing suckling duration and use of oxytocin delayed POI, however, POI was shortest in buffaloes suckled for one month. The high yielding buffaloes also manifested better reproductive cyclicity; while moderate yielder showed shorter ovulation intervals and higher conception rate",dairy buffalo;milk production;oxytocin;progesterone;reproductive performance;suckling,"oxytocin;progesterone;animal;animal food;article;buffalo;chemistry;dairying;drug effect;female;metabolism;milk;physiology;productivity;reproduction;suckling;time;animal feed;animals;animals, suckling;buffaloes;dairying;efficiency;female;milk;oxytocin;progesterone;reproduction;time factors;bubalus","Qureshi, M.S.; Faculty of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Science, NWFP Agricultural University, Peshawar, 25120, Pakistan; email: drmsqureshi@aup.edu.pk",,,03784320,,ANRSD,17611053.0,English,Anim Reprod Sci,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-42949112022,2,Pakistan,Pakistan,nwfp agricultural university;department of animal reproduction,nwfp agricultural university,bcs;body;body condition;buffalo;buffaloes;calf;cases;conception;conception rate;condition;condition score;conditions;corpus;corpus luteum;cycle;cyclicity;dairy;dairy buffalo;data;day;day postpartum;days;decline;delayed;depression;dosage;duration;effect;efficiency;estrus;estrus cycle;estrus group;estrus interval;examination;expulsion;expulsion time;fat;fcm;field;field condition;fifty;group;haemorrhagicum;high yielding;injection;injections;interval;interval pei;interval poi;intervals;investigate;investigate effect;involution;involution length;iu;kg;kgd;length;length pui;level mpl;levels;live weight;loss;luteum;luteum haemorrhagicum;mean;mean dosage;mean fcm;mean poi;mean postpartum;milk;milk fcm;milk let;milk progesterone;milk sample;milk yield;moderate;moderate yielder;month;month p;mpl;next estrus;ngml;niliravi;oestrus;ovarian cyclicity;ovulation;ovulation depression;ovulation interval;oxytocin;oxytocin injection;p;parameters;parturition;pei;pei p;pei r;performance;period;periurban;periurban farming;pet;placental;placental expulsion;poi;poi r;postpartum;postpartum estrus;postpartum ovulation;postpartum uterine;prepartum;presence;present;present study;progesterone;progesterone level;pui;r;radioimmunoassay;radioimmunoassay ria;rapid decline;rate;rectal;rectal examination;reproductive;reproductive cyclicity;reproductive efficiency;reproductive parameter;reproductive performance;resume;ria;samples;score;score bcs;shorter;shortest;silent;silent estrus;soft corpus;stimulate;stimulate milk;stimulus;study;study suggests;suggests;system;time;time pet;treatments;use;uterine;uterine involution;weight;yield;yielder;±,buffaloes;calf;dairy;dairy buffalo;interaction;milk;milk yield;oxytocin;performance;reproductive;reproductive performance;use;yield,627

The study involved observations on the use of ponds in urban agriculture in Kumasi, Ghana, and more than 300 irrigation water samples were taken for physico-chemical and microbial laboratory analysis. The study shows that while on-farm ponds are commonly used, their potential to remove pathogens through sedimentation has not been fully optimized. Two-thirds of helminth eggs were in the sediments and careful collection of irrigation water without disturbing sediments reduced helminth eggs in irrigation water by about 70%. Helminth eggs reduced from about 5 to less than 1 egg per litre in three days in both dry and wet seasons while thermotolerant coliforms took six days in the dry season to reduce from about 8 to 4 log units per 100 ml, to meet the WHO guidelines. For optimal pathogen removal, better pond designs, farmers' training on collection of water with minimal disturbance and any other means to enhance sedimentation and pathogen die-off can be essential components of a multiple-barrier approach complementing farm-based measures like simple filtration techniques, better irrigation methods and post-harvest contamination",microbial water quality;on-farm sedimentation ponds;urban farming;wastewater,"filtration;irrigation;optimization;pathogens;sedimentation;settling tanks;water quality;irrigation water;on-farm ponds;urban farming;water bacteriology;filtration;irrigation;optimization;pathogens;sedimentation;settling tanks;water bacteriology;water quality;farming system;hydrological response;irrigation;microbial activity;pathogen;physicochemical property;pond;sampling;sedimentation;water pollution;water quality;article;coliform bacterium;controlled study;crop production;filtration;ghana;heat tolerance;irrigation (agriculture);microbial contamination;nonhuman;physical chemistry;pond;practice guideline;seasonal variation;sedimentation;urban area;vegetable;waste water;water contamination;water quality;water sampling;water treatment;world health organization;worm egg;agriculture;animals;enterobacteriaceae;geologic sediments;ghana;helminths;parasite egg count;vegetables;waste disposal, fluid;water;water supply;africa;ashanti;ghana;kumasi;sub-saharan africa;west africa;vermes","Keralta, B.; IWMI Africa Office, CSIR Campus, Accra, Ghana; email: b.keraita@cgiar.org",,,02731223,,WSTED,18359990.0,English,Water Sci Technol,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-42549088142,3,Denmark;Ghana,Ghana,iwmi africa office;department of international health,iwmi africa office,agriculture;analysis;approach;assessment;careful;careful collection;coliforms;collection;components;contamination;days;designs;dieoff;disturbance;dry;dry season;egg;eggs;enhance;enhance sedimentation;essential component;farmer training;farmers;filtration;filtration technique;ghana;guidelines;helminth;helminth egg;irrigation;irrigation method;irrigation water;kumasi;laboratory;laboratory analysis;levels;litre;log;log unit;means;measures;meet;methods;microbial;microbial contamination;microbial laboratory;minimal;minimal disturbance;ml;multiplebarrier;observations;onfarm;onfarm pond;optimal pathogen;paper;paper present;pathogen;pathogen dieoff;pathogen removal;pathogens;pond;pond design;ponds;postharvest;presents;removal;samples;season;seasons;sedimentation;sediments;shows;simple;simple filtration;study;study show;techniques;thermotolerant;thermotolerant coliforms;training;twothirds;units;urban agriculture;use;wastewater;water;water sample;wet;wet season,ghana;irrigation;irrigation water;microbial;microbial quality;onfarm;onfarm sedimentation;ponds;quality;sedimentation;sedimentation pond;urban vegetable;vegetable;vegetable farming;water,628

Soil or potting mix are commonly used for green roof applications but may be heavy, difficult to contain, and leach mineral nutrients and particulates. The effectiveness of potting soil, petrochemical-based foam sheets and fiberglass sheets was compared on the roof of Seitz Hall on the Virginia Tech campus. In a randomized complete block design, four 4.88 x 0.61 x 0.21 m Plexiglas containers, subdivided into four 0.61 x 0.61 x 0.21 m subplots, were filled with 10 cm potting mix, foam, fiberglass, or blank control over a 6.8 cm drainage layer of gravel. Kale (Brassica oleracea var. acephala) was established from transplants grown from April through May. Runoff, roof temperature, mineral content, media composition, and biomass were recorded for each treatment. A gravity-fed irrigation system supplied water through drip tape as needed. The least runoff came from commercial potting soil and the most from foam. Fiberglass media had the greatest water holding capacity on a dry weight basis. Foam had high moisture holding capacity and good aeration that facilitated excellent root proliferation through the media. Fiberglass had a pH of 8.8 and less root growth. Potting soil produced the greatest kale biomass while foam was second. Foam and fiberglass had lower nutrient content and cation exchange capacity compared to potting soil. The mineral content and particulates in the runoff from fiberglass and foam media was very low.

To examine the capacity of alkaline resistance of Albizzia julibrissin Durazz seedlings, the contents of MDA, soluble sugar and proline, and the activity of POD and SOD in Albizzia julibrissin Durazz tree body were measured by means of visible spectrophotometry. Also, the change patterns of the five indexes with different treatment concentration and time were analyzed. Attempts were then made to elucidate the physiological mechanism of how alkaline stress affects the growth of the Albizzia julibrissin Durazz tree, which could provide theoretical foundation for planting and gardening and an approach to dealing with the difficulties in planting and gardening in saline and alkaline area. The results showed that with the increase in Na2CO3 concentration, the contents of MDA and soluble sugar in the leaves slowly ascended when the treatment concentration was lower than 75 mmol·L-1, and then rapidly increased when the treatment concentration was higher than 75 mmol·L-1; There were significant differences between different treatments. Proline content exhibited the same change pattern with MDA and soluble sugar. It slowly ascended when the treatment concentration was lower than 100 mmol·L-1, whereas it sharply increased when the treatment concentration was above 100 mmol·L-1; The changes in SOD and POD were similar, showing a unimodal pattern. However, the treatment concentration corresponding to the maximum of SOD and POD was 50 and 75 mmol·L-1, respectively. With the changes in stress time, in addition, the contents of MDA treated with the same concentration increased gradually. However, praline, soluble sugar, SOD and POD changed irregularly.

Over 800 million hectares (i.e., nearly 38% of the total landmass of the earth) is committed to producing crops to support this still growing population. Farming has dramatically transformed the landscape, replacing and redefining functional ecosystems. Undeniably, a reliable food supply has allowed for the evolution of culturally robust societies. Ironically, farming has created a set of new hazards unique to activities involved with the production of food, and has exacerbated many older ones. Exposure to toxic levels of agrochemicals (pesticides, fungicides) and a wide spectrum of geohelminths are transmitted with regularity at the tropical and sub-tropical agricultural interface. Emerging infections, many of which are viral zoonoses (e.g., Ebola, Lassa fever) have adapted to the human host following our encroachment into their environments. In 50 years, the human population is expected to increase to some 8.3 billion individuals. Feeding these new arrivals will require an additional 109 hectares of farmland; land that does not exist.

The buffaloes are kept under peri-urban farming systems to produce milk for urban populations. Breeding is delayed in these herds to get more economic benefit because farmers believe that the pregnancy decreases milk production. The lactation milk value has been studied in this paper as an economic indicator. Complete milk yield records of 3,304 buffaloes was collected from a group of state farms. Economic traits including lactation yield, lactation length, calving interval (CI), dry period and milk yield per day of calving interval (MYPDCI) were derived from the data. The animals were grouped according to parity number (1-3), service period (G1 to G4, conceiving during <150, 150-200, 200-300 and >300 days post calving) and yield levels (HMY>2,500; MMY 2,001-2,500; and LMY 1,500-2,000 liters/ lactation). To study the effect of pregnancy on milk composition a research trial was conducted at a medium size private dairy farm, using forty lactating buffaloes of three yield levels and four service period groups, as described already. Milk was sampled on alternate weeks and analyzed for fat and protein contents (%). For quantifying the value of milk produced during a lactation period, the value corrected milk (VCM) was determined and converted to lactation milk value (LMV). Group means were compared for various parameters. Highest milk yield (2,836.50+15.68 liters/lactation) was recorded in the HMY animals of G4 group while lowest milk yield of 1,657.04±18.34 liters/lactation was found in LMY of G1. Lactation was significantly increased with the extending of service period. The shortest dry period was recorded in HMY, parity 1, G1 animals and the longest in parity 2, MMY, G4.The CI was shortest in HMY, parity 1, and G1 animals and longest in LMY, parity 3, G4 buffaloes. The HMY, parity 2, G1 buffaloes showed the highest MYPDCI and the lowest value was recorded (6.53±0.17 vs. 2.76±0.04 liter/day) for LMY, parity 1, G4 buffaloes. The VCM decreased with the delayed conception. This decreasing trend was higher in respect of the total yield but decrease in the VCM was smaller due to the increasing levels of fat and protein in the milk. The gap between the various production classes was reduced based on the VCM as compared with the yield per day of CI. LMV showed a consistent decline with extending service period in all three production groups. The study suggests that CI increased with delayed conception, showing a consistent trend in the low, moderate and high yielding buffaloes. There was a coherent declining pattern of milk yield with delaying conception, associated with prolonged CI. An animal conceiving at a later stage of lactation showed a decline in financial returns of 24 to 27% compared with those conceiving earli",dairy buffaloes;lactation milk value;pregnancy;reproduction,animalia;bubalus;lettuce mosaic virus,"Qureshi, M.S.; Faculty of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Sciences, NWFP Agricultural University, Peshawar-25120, Pakistan; email: drmsqureshi@aup.edu.pk",,Asian-Australasian Association of Animal Production Societies,10112367,,,,English,Asian-Australas J Anim Sci,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-43749123490,6,Pakistan,Pakistan,nwfp agricultural university;department of livestock management,nwfp agricultural university,alternate;alternate week;animal;animal conceiving;animals;asia;benefit;breeding;buffalo;buffaloes;ci;classes;coherent;complete milk;composition;conception;consistent;consistent decline;consistent trend;contents;dairy;dairy farm;data;day;day post;days;decline;decrease;decrease milk;decreases;delayed;described;dry;dry period;earli;economic benefit;economic indicator;economic trait;effect;farm;farmers;farms;fat;financial return;forty;forty lactating;found;g1;g1 animal;g1 buffalo;g4;g4 buffaloes;g4 group;gap;group;group mean;grouped;groups;herds;high yielding;hmy;hmy animal;hmy2;indicator;interval;interval ci;interval mypdci;kept;lactation;lactation length;lactation milk;lactation period;lactation yield;length;level hmy2;levels;liter;liter lactation;literday;liters;literslactation;lmv;lmy;major source;means;medium;medium size;milk;milk composition;milk production;milk value;milk vcm;milk yield;mmy;moderate;mypdci;number;paper;parameters;parity;parity number;pattern;period;period g1;period group;periurban;periurban farming;populations;post;post calving;pregnancy;pregnancy decrease;private dairy;produce;produce milk;production;production class;production group;protein;protein content;records;research;research trial;respect;returns;service;service period;shortest;size;source;stage;state;state farm;study;study suggests;suggests;systems;total yield;traits;trend;trial;urban population;value;value lmv;various parameter;various production;vcm;vs;weeks;world;yield;yield level;yield record,buffaloes;dairy;dairy buffalo;effect;lactation;lactation milk;milk;milk value;pregnancy;value,633

Uneven distribution of income, prevalence of poverty, diminishing farmlands, inefficient distribution systems, and rising expectations have contributed to increasingly critical problems of food supply and distribution. Urban agriculture in developing economies has evolved in response to changing demand and supplies. The study was carried out in southwestern Nigeria, to determine the production efficiencies and causes of inefficiencies in urban production on a low lying, seasonally flooded, plain that has enough retained moisture to support dry season cropping of short duration crops. This is termed fadama agriculture. A sample survey of 242 urban vegetable farmers was conducted between and March 2006. Data on yield, planting combinations, and farm size were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. The stochastic frontier model of technical efficiency was used in estimating the production efficiencies of farms, and the sources of technical inefficiency. Mean farm size was 0.54 ha; the mean age of producers was 42.6 years while the mean technical efficiency was 74.36%. The major sources of technical efficiencies were found to be in the employment of labor, and in the use of land and seed or cultivar resources.

A practical, low-cost concept that has not been explored is recycling organic solid waste into compost for urban cultivation. This research explored the feasibility of recycling organic solid waste into urban cultivation as a sustainable waste-management strategy in low-income neighborhoods. The main hypothesis of this study is that a significant proportion of solid waste can be diverted from inefficient disposal by redirecting the organic fraction into urban cultivation. The study revealed that waste-based urban cultivation could significantly reduce quantities of organic solid waste for disposal, and minimize waste collection and disposal cost.

To meet these changing demands requires adjustments in market structures which need planning. One lesson learned from this analysis is that urbanization and increased income may not necessarily bring all positive changes in food quality. While the diet becomes more balanced in terms of micronutrient consumption, the increased demand for fat-based calories, processed and restaurant foods, and drift away from fresh sources of farm and homegarden foods raised alarm for food quality and safety.

Methods: Trials on drip kits, furrow irrigation and watering cans were conducted with urban vegetable farmers. Trials were arranged in a completely randomised block design with each plot having all three irrigation methods tested. This was conducted in both dry and wet seasons. Three hundred and ninety-six lettuce, 72 soil, 15 poultry manure and 32 water samples were analysed for thermotolerant coliforms and helminth eggs. Results: Lettuce irrigated with drip kits had the lowest levels of contamination, with, on average, 4 log units per 100 g, fewer thermotolerant coliforms than that irrigated with watering cans. However, drip kits often got clogged, required lower crop densities and restricted other routine farm activities. Watering cans were the most popular method. Using watering cans with caps on outlets from a height <0.5 m reduced thermotolerant coliforms by 2.5 log units and helminthes by 2.3 eggs per 100 g of lettuce compared with using watering cans without caps from a height >1 m. Conclusion: Simple, cheap and easily adoptable irrigation methods have great potential to reduce crop contamination in low-income areas. When used in combination with other on-farm and post-harvest risk reduction measures, these will help to comprehensively reduce public health risks from using polluted water in vegetable farming",contamination;lettuce;low-cost irrigation methods;microbial;urban agriculture;wastewater,cost-benefit analysis;fecal coliform;food safety;irrigation;leafy vegetable;urban agriculture;wastewater;water treatment;agricultural worker;agriculture;article;bacterial count;bacterium detection;coliform bacterium;food contamination;heat tolerance;helminth;irrigation (agriculture);lettuce;lowest income group;manure;microbial contamination;nonhuman;pollution control;rainy season;risk reduction;season;soil analysis;summer;urban area;vegetable;waste water recycling;water analysis;water pollution;water sampling;agriculture;animals;diarrhea;enterobacteriaceae;female;ghana;helminths;humans;irrigation;lettuce;male;public health;sewage;soil microbiology;water microbiology;water supply;africa;ghana;sub-saharan africa;west africa;lactuca;vermes,"Keraita, B.; IWMI Kumasi Office, c/o KNUST, Kumasi, Ghana; email: b.keraita@cgiar.org",,,13602276,,TMIHF,18005311.0,English,Trop Med Int Health,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-36248993996,4,Denmark;Ghana,Ghana,iwmi kumasi office;international water management institute (iwmi);department of international health;kwame nkrumah university of science and technology (knust),iwmi kumasi office,activities;adoptable irrigation;areas;assess;block;block design;cans;caps;cheap;coliforms;combination;conclusion;conclusion simple;contamination;crop;crop contamination;crop density;densities;design;drip;drip irrigation;drip kit;dry;effectiveness;egg;eggs;farm;farm activity;farmers;furrow;furrow irrigation;g;ghana;great potential;health;health risk;height;helminth;helminth egg;helminthes;help;irrigation;irrigation kit;irrigation method;kits;lettuce;levels;log;log unit;lowincome;lowincome area;manure;measures;method;method trial;methods;ninetysix;ninetysix lettuce;objective;onfarm;outlets;plot;polluted water;popular method;postharvest;postharvest risk;poultry;poultry manure;public;public health;reduction;reduction measure;result lettuce;results;risk;risk reduction;risks;routine;routine farm;samples;seasons;simple;simple irrigation;soil;thermotolerant;thermotolerant coliforms;trials;units;urban farming;urban vegetable;use;vegetable;vegetable farmer;vegetable farming;water;water sample;wet;wet season,contamination;effect;irrigation;irrigation method;lettuce;lowcost;lowcost irrigation;methods;microbial;microbial contamination;untreated wastewater;wastewater,637

Box 7014, SE-750 07 Uppsala, Sweden","In many peri-urban areas of Southeast Asia, land use has been transformed from rice-based to more profitable vegetable-based systems in order to meet the increasing market demand. The major management related flows of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn) were quantified over a 1-year period for intensive small-scale aquatic and terrestrial vegetable systems situated in two peri-urban areas of Hanoi City, Vietnam. The two areas have different sources of irrigation water; wastewater from Hanoi City and water from the Red River upstream of Hanoi. The first nutrient balances for this region and farming systems are presented. The main sources of individual elements were quantified and the nutrient use efficiency estimated. The environmental risks for losses and/or soil accumulation were also assessed and discussed in relation to long-term sustainability and health aspects. The primary source of nutrient input involved a combination of chemical fertilisers, manure (chicken) and irrigation water. A variable composition and availability of the latter two sources greatly influenced the relative magnitude of the final total loads for individual elements. Despite relatively good nutrient use efficiencies being demonstrated for N (46-86%) and K (66-94%), and to some extent also for P (19-46%), high inputs still resulted in substantial annual surpluses causing risks for losses to surface and ground waters. The surplus for N ranged from 85 to 882 kg ha-1 year-1, compared to P and K which were 109-196 and 20-306 kg ha-1 year-1, respectively. Those for Cu and Zn varied from 0.2 to 2.7 and from 0.6 to 7.7 kg ha-1 year-1, respectively, indicating high risk for soil accumulation and associated transfers through the food chain. Wastewater irrigation contributed to high inputs, and excess use of organic and chemical fertilisers represent a major threat to the soil and water environment. Management options that improve nutrient use efficiency represent an important objective that will help reduce annual surpluses. A sustainable reuse of wastewater for irrigation in peri-urban farming systems can contribute significantly to the nutrient supply (assuming low concentrations of potential toxic or hazardous substances in the water). Nutrient inputs need to be better related to the crop need, e.g. through better knowledge about the nutrient concentrations in the wastewater and improved management of the amount of irrigation water being applied",copper;element balance;nutrients;peri-urban;southeast asia;zinc,agricultural management;alternative agriculture;copper;farming system;fertilizer application;irrigation;land use;manure;nutrient budget;nutrient use efficiency;recycling;soil nutrient;vegetable;wastewater;zinc;asia;eurasia;hanoi;red river [asia];southeast asia;viet nam,"Khai, N.M.; Department of Soil Sciences, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU), P.O.

The concept of agriculture has changed with years and now it is one of the major industries inviting significant problems of waste byproducts disposal due to massive use of inorganic fertilizers and pesticides. Increased carbon emissions along with deforestation are producing global climate changes that have far-reaching consequences for agriculture.

The study was conducted in five informal settlements of Atteridgeville, Pretoria and involved a pilot study, a household survey and multiple case studies using participants in the different types of urban farming projects as units of data collection and analysis. More than half of the households in the study area participated in urban farming which consisted of home gardening, group gardening and dryland farming in open urban spaces. Active participation was predominantly by women. The contribution to total household income and food security of the different types of farming found in the study area was generally modest but the livelihood benefits derived from urban farming extended far beyond material gain, reducing social alienation and the disintegration of families associated with urban poverty.

Box, 4002 Basel, Switzerland","Objectives: To identify risk factors for Schistosoma mansoni and hookworm infections in urban farming communities, and to investigate small-scale spatial patterns of infection prevalence. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was carried out in 113 farming households (586 individuals) and 21 non-farming households (130 individuals) from six agricultural zones in the town of Man, western Cote d'Ivoire. Heads of households were interviewed on common agricultural activities, land and water use, education attainment, socioeconomic status and sanitation facilities. Household members provided stool specimens that were processed by the Kato-Katz technique and a formol-ether concentration method and diagnosed for S. mansoni, hookworms and other soil-transmitted helminths and intestinal protozoa. Bayesian statistics were employed for spatial analyses. Results: The prevalences of S. mansoni and hookworm in farming households were 51.4% and 24.7%, respectively. Risk factors for a S. mansoni infection comprised living in close proximity to the Ko River, water contact with irrigation wells and ponds and low education attainment. Living in zones of smallholder irrigated rice plots or large rice perimeters, using water from domestic wells, and low socioeconomic status were risk factors for a hookworm infection. We found significant spatial heterogeneity between agricultural zones, with the highest infection prevalences of S. mansoni and hookworm in the zone where there was a large rice perimeter. Conclusions: In this urban setting, both S. mansoni and hookworm infections were related to specific agricultural activities.

Urban agriculture is an important livelihood strategy to increase access to and availability of food in urban settings. Objective. We examined the impact of sociodemographic and farming variables on the household food security and nutritional security of an index child aged 2 to 5 years. Our hypothesis was that dietary quality (percentage of energy from animal-source foods [%ASF] and dietary diversity) would have an impact on infection (as measured by C-reactive protein [CRP]), which in turn would have an impact on biochemical indices (hemoglobin and retinol) and anthropometric indices (weight-for-age z-score [WAZ] and body mass index z-score [ZBMI]). We examined the relationships among urban agricultural activities, household food security, and child nutritional security. Methods. We conducted a cross-sectional survey of 296 households within each randomly selected study zone in Kampala, Uganda. Correlations were calculated and bivariate and exploratory path analysis was conducted to explore relationships. Results. Household food security score was significantly positively correlated with the number of tropical livestock units (r = 0.142, p = .017), dietary diversity (r = 0.230, p <.001), %ASF (r = 0.185, p =.002), and WAZ (r = 0.149, p =.017). Exploratory path analysis demonstrated a significant positive relationship between household food security and %ASF, which in turn was positively associated with retinol. Consumption of animal-source food was significantly negatively associated with C-reactive protein level, which in turn was significantly negatively associated with hemoglobin level, and hemoglobin was significantly positively associated with WAZ. Conclusions. Our findings are supportive of efforts to enhance access to land for urban farming and engagement in activities aimed at improving the quality of dietary intake of urban residents, in particular by increasing consumption of animal-source foods",children;developing countries/nations;food security;health status;nutrition security;path analysis;urban agriculture,"biological marker;c reactive protein;developing world;dietary shift;food security;health status;nutritional status;urban agriculture;agriculture;anthropometry;article;blood;body mass;catering service;child nutrition;crop;cross-sectional study;female;health;health status;human;male;meat;methodology;nutritional status;nutritional value;physiology;preschool child;uganda;agriculture;anthropometry;biological markers;body mass index;c-reactive protein;child nutrition physiology;child, preschool;crops, agricultural;cross-sectional studies;female;food supply;health status;humans;male;meat;nutritional status;nutritive value;uganda;urban health;africa;central province [uganda];east africa;kampala;sub-saharan africa;uganda;animalia","Yeudall, F.; School of Nutrition, Ryerson University, 350 Victoria Street, Toronto, ON M5B 2K3, Canada; email: fyeudall@ryerson.ca",,,03795721,,,17658070.0,English,Food Nutr Bull,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-34250322537,6,Uganda;Canada;Peru,Canada,school of nutrition;department of public health sciences;british columbia centre for disaster control;international potato center;institute for work and health;the international potato centre;department of food science and technology,school of nutrition,access;activities;agricultural activity;agriculture;analysis;animalsource;animalsource food;anthropometric;anthropometric index;asf;asf r;availability;background;biochemical index;bivariate;body;body mass;child;conclusions;consumption;correlations;creactive;creactive protein;crosssectional;crosssectional survey;crp;dietary diversity;dietary intake;dietary quality;diversity;diversity r;efforts;energy;engagement;enhance;enhance access;exploratory;exploratory path;explore;explore relationship;findings;food;food asf;food security;foods;hemoglobin;household;household food;households;hypothesis;impact;important livelihood;increase;increase access;index;index child;index hemoglobin;index weightforage;index zscore;indices;infection;intake;kampala;land;level;livelihood;livelihood strategy;livestock;livestock unit;mass;mass index;methods;number;nutritional security;objective;p;path;path analysis;percentage;positive relationship;protein;protein crp;quality;quality percentage;r;relationship;relationships;residents;results;retinol;score;security;security score;settings;strategy;study;study zone;supportive;survey;tropical livestock;turn;uganda;unit r;units;urban agriculture;urban farming;urban resident;urban setting;variables;waz;waz r;weightforage;weightforage zscore;year;years;zbmi;zone;zscore;zscore waz;zscore zbmi,children;farmers;food;kampala;nutritional security;security;uganda;urban farmer,642

The random sampling technique was used in selecting 85 farmers from the following three areas where urban food crop production is prominent: Ajibode, Ijokodo, and Eleyele. The datawere collected through structured questionnaires and analysed using both descriptive statistics and stochastic production frontier based on the Cobb-Douglas production function. The results reveal that farmland, family labour, and plantlings are statistical determinants of urban food crop production in the study area. Fertilizer and hired labour are, however, not statistically significant in influencing urban food crop production. The result of the determinants of technical efficiency model reveals that full-time occupation in urban farming and sole-cropping pattern were positively related to technical efficiency. An increase in the age, experience, and years of formal education of the urban farmers increases the level of technical efficiency. The policy implication is that there are still more opportunities to raise the present level of technical efficiency of urban crop production in the study area. Educating farmers so that they are more receptive to modern improved technologies coming fromthe agricultural research systemcan lead to higher output per unit of input.

The study confirmed the common observations on traditional poultry keeping such as scavenging during the day and housing overnight. The flock size (7.7 ± 3 ducks per unit) showed no specialization of husbandry (100% of surveyed flocks were kept for simultaneous production of ducklings, meat and eggs) and a high drake-to-duck ratio (1:3). The hatchability was close to 80.5% ± 13%, whereas the average number of eggs was 13.2 ± 5 per clutch. In addition, a high mortality (80%) was observed in ducklings, which was due to poor feeding, lack of veterinary care and housing conditions. Eggs and live ducks were sold by duck farmers in response to the family needs rather than market price.

Land surrounding homes also may have played a symbolic role in these agrarian societies. Water works - formal ponds associated with temple platforms and other prominent structures as well as with many residential mounds - support the idea of symbolic as well as practical functions in land use around buildings. Dispersed occupation occurs in low elevations suited to recessional planting, a technique that takes advantage of dry season ground moisture in low areas where rain and flood waters recede as the water table drops. We analyze elevational zones to show greater settlement density in the low-lying Blanco River delta than in higher elevations upriver. Analysis of distances between archaeological residences and wetlands and drainages shows that residences generally were close to seasonally flooded areas. We also highlight anthropogenic qualities in the alluvial landscape, offering a land use perspective distinct from other views of agricultural intensification. The settlement pattern is compatible with Mesoamerican forms of urbanism. Copyrigh",,,"Stark, B.

Contamination of vegetables with heavy metals from vehicle emissions in Kampala occurred at different levels depending on location and affected storage roots, stems and leaves in different ways. Horticultural species thus need to be selected according to location and the plant part consumed. Preliminary results from Kampala also show penetration of plant tissue by pathogens, indicating that under pathogen risk, producers should plant species for cooking. To understand pesticide risk, pest management aspects of different urban farming systems were characterized. In intensive peri-urban systems, pest management is strongly related to market pressure rather than the ecology of plants and farm, with widespread preventive spraying, extensive use of highly toxic pesticides in several sites, and late spraying common. Evidence of residues was found right along the value chain of jasmine flowers, up to distribution of garlands. Because urban agriculture often involves agricultural migrants and non-farmers, indigenous knowledge may be less robust than in rural agriculture. Knowledge of pest biology or dynamics for example was found to be limited. Hanoi findings indicate a correlation between time spent in urban agriculture and reduced pesticide use. Sources of pest management knowledge are limited, mainly based on local vendors of pesticides. Although the market exercises a powerful influence on these systems, producers also seek new crop management learning opportunities. Urban-adapted Farmer Field Schools for integrated crop management have been introduced in Lima and Philippines. The involvement of local government authorities in this learning process has been important and needs to be an integral part of a sustainable strategy for urban horticulture syste",livelihoods;urban horticulture,jasminum,"Prain, G.; CGIAR System-wide Initiative on Urban and Peri-urban Agriculture, International Potato Center, Lima, Peru",,International Society for Horticultural Science,05677572,,,,English,Acta Hortic,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-61449124061,3,Peru,Peru,international potato center,international potato center,affected storage;agricultural migrant;agriculture;aspects;authorities;biology;chain;contamination;cooking;correlation;countries;crop;crop management;different level;different urban;different way;distribution;dynamics;ecology;emissions;evidence;example;exercises;extensive use;farm;farmer;farmer field;field;field school;findings;flowers;found;garlands;government;government authority;hanoi;health;health risk;heavy metal;highlights;horticultural specie;horticulture;horticulture syste;indicate;indigenous knowledge;influence;integral part;intensive periurban;involvement;involves;jasmine;jasmine flower;kampala;knowledge;le robust;leaves;levels;light;lima;local government;local vendor;location;management;management aspect;management knowledge;management learning;market;market exercise;market pressure;metals;migrants;need;needs;new crop;nonfarmers;opportunities;paper;paper highlight;part;pathogen;pathogen risk;pathogens;penetration;periurban;periurban horticulture;periurban system;pest;pest biology;pest management;pesticide;pesticide risk;pesticide use;pesticides;philippines;plant;plant part;plant specie;plant tissue;plants;powerful influence;preliminary result;pressure;prevalence;preventive;preventive spraying;process;producers;residues;resolve;results;right;risk;risks;robust;roots;rural agriculture;schools;seek;several site;show;show penetration;sites;sources;species;spent;stems;storage;storage root;strategy;sustainable strategy;syste;systems;time;time spent;tissue;toxic;toxic pesticide;understand;understand pesticide;urban agriculture;urban farming;urban horticulture;urban location;urbanadapted farmer;use;value;value chain;vegetables;vehicle;vehicle emission;vendors;ways;widespread preventive,ecosystems;environmental lesson;horticulture;lessons;regions;studies;urban ecosystem,647

A typical feature in urban settings of Africa is the maintenance of traditional livelihoods, including agriculture. The purpose of this study was to investigate malaria risk factors in urban farming communities in a medium-sized town in Cote d'Ivoire. Two cross-sectional surveys were carried out among 112 households from six agricultural zones. First, the heads of households were interviewed on agricultural land use, farming practices, water storage, sanitation facilities, and socioeconomic status. Second, a finger prick blood sample was taken from all household members and examined for the occurrence and density of Plasmodia. Geographic coordinates of houses, farming plots, and potential mosquito breeding sites were recorded and integrated into a geographic information system. Predictors of Plasmodium falciparum parasitemia were assessed using non-random and random effects Bayesian regression models. The overall prevalence of P. falciparum was 32.1%. In children < 15 years of age, risk factors for a P. falciparum infection included living in a specific agricultural zone, close proximity to permanent ponds and fish ponds, periodic stays overnight in temporary farm huts, and low socioeconomic status. Our findings indicate that specific crop systems and specific agricultural practices may increase the risk of malaria in urban settings of tropical Africa.

Considering its rapid expansion all over the world, especially in African countries, urban agriculture is mostly regarded as a survival strategy. The attempt in this paper is to answer the following question: are people pushed into urban farming because they have no choice or are they engaged in urban agriculture because they know they can make a good living out of it? The article identifies several factors that force urban dwellers to resort to agricultural activities, as well as those that attract them for nutritional, financial and social reasons. These factors include, structural adjustment programs, decline in world prices of the primary commodities, economic crisis, low wage or salary, unemployment, rapid population growth, war, poverty, etc., which have led urban people to cultivate or raise animals or livestock. At the same time, urban agriculture has been proven as source of food, income and employment.

Hereby 710 households have been randomly selected from a previous survey data base containing 2 800 urban households. About one third of the Brazzaville households are involved in urban agriculture with 29.5% households reporting crop production activities and 8.8% animal production activities. Within animal production, aviculture activities are dominant. Gardening and vegetable production play also an important role. The conflict situation of 1997 affected negatively urban agricultural production in particular the animal production. Although, urban agriculture is present among different social and professional categories, there is a clear dominance of subsistence and poor households, especially those already active in agriculture before. In contrast to crop production, mainly practised for subsistence reasons, the motivation for animal production is driven more by the income than by the own consumption possibilities. The results also indicate that assuring a sustainable and equitable urban development is possible by a good balance between those practising urban agriculture and those not.

Life Sci., Gregor Mendel Strasse 33, Vienna A-1180, Austria","In Vienna, consultants, organic farmers and green-minded consumers have developed a new concept of urban organic farming, called Selbsternte ('self-harvest'). Organic farmers prepare a plot of arable land (the Selbsternte plot) and sow or plant rows composed of 18-23 plant species. In mid-May the plots are divided into subplots that contain 2-6 m of every sown species and are rented to so-called self-harvesters for a period of about 136 days. In 2002 Selbsternte was being practiced at 15 plots in Vienna or in neighboring cities, represented by 861 subplots, with a total area of 68,740 m2, and managed by 12 organic farmers for 861 registered self-harvesters. At the Roter Berg plot, experimental subplots were established to evaluate yields and the value of the harvested produce, and interviews were conducted with 27 self-harvesters, the eight Selbsternte farmers and one Selbsternte consultant. The experimental subplots were managed in two different ways, namely, 'with low intensity' (LIS) and 'with high intensity' (HIS; meaning additional harrowing, mulching and sowing of additional plants). At the LIS 24.2 h and at the HIS 38.9 h of work were invested over 51 days. Monetary investment was US$184 for the LIS and US$259 for the HIS subplots. The total harvest of fresh produce was: 163 kg subplot-1 for LIS and 208 kg subplot-1 for HIS subplots. The total value of the harvest at the HIS was US$364 for conventional and US$766 for organic prices. All self-harvesters saw the rental of a subplot and the work as an activity of leisure. More than half of the self-harvesters reported 'trying something new' at their subplots. The most frequently mentioned innovation for them was growing an unknown species. Twenty-five self-harvesters sowed 54 different, additional plant species. The motivating factors in establishing Selbsternte plots, as reported by all the farmers, were, primarily, better relations with consumers and work diversification, and only then were economic factors a consideration. The contribution of Selbsternte to income varied at the farms, being between 0 and 30% of the total farm income. As a main success factor, all of the farmers reported a close relationship between the self-harvesters and the farmers. Selbsternte subplots can be understood as small experimental stations where self-harvesters merge traditional horticultural techniques with urban ideas on permaculture, sustainable land use and participatory farming. Selbsternte has potential value for the improvement of urban agriculture, but also for the development of organic farming in general",agrobiodiversity;farmers' experiments;innovation;organic farming;self-harvesters relations;urban farming,agricultural practice;harvesting;organic farming;urban agriculture;austria;central europe;eurasia;europe;vienna;miletinae,"Vogl, C.R.; Institute for Organic Farming, Univ. for Nat.

Two thousand eight hundred randomly selected families from Brazzaville (Congo) were surveyed. From these, 6% are both keeping livestock and producing crops, 3% are keeping livestock only, 24% are producing crops only and 67% are not producing crops nor keeping livestock. From these four groups, respectively, 135, 84, 246 and 245 households were interviewed to collect further data on household and location characteristics. Non-parametric and parametric techniques were compared as tools to analyse the groups. In the non-parametric classification tree method CART following variables were identified as being important for the engagement in keeping livestock or urban agriculture: keeping livestock before 1997, practising agriculture before 1997, property size, locality, income, availability of water, professional activity and level of instruction. Including surrogate variables resulted in extra variables: age, availability of electricity and sex. In the multinomial regression only the most important variables from the classification tree were withheld and other insights were obtained. The results of this research highlighted the shortcomings of multinomial regression. Fitting a full model containing all possible interactions becomes an impossible task with 20 explanatory variables. Using the classification tree information in a multinomial model appears the most appropriate solution, and this method is a useful tool for further work in the analysis of livestock and crop production systems. The importance of the historical component in the decision to practise crop production and keep livestock was demonstrated. Being involved in crop production develops roots, which cannot be destroyed by impediments such as periods of conflict",central africa;classification trees;crop production livestock urban agriculture;multinomial regression,crop production;farming system;livestock farming;urban agriculture;africa;brazzaville;central africa;congo;sub-saharan africa,"Speybroeck, N.; Department of Tropical Animal Health, Prnc.

The access to a market has led to increased availability of fertilisers and livestock feed in these areas, which has resulted in a dramatic increase in nutrient inputs. The objective of this study was to describe nutrient management on smallholder farming systems in a peri-urban area outside Ho Chi Minh City in southern Vietnam. Nutrient management was assessed by nutrient balances and flows and the data were gathered through interviews with local farmers, and measurement of inputs and outputs. Nine farms were selected containing one or more of the following production units: pig, crops, and fish. Feedstuff s and fertilisers were important sources of input of N, P and K on the livestock farms. On the farms without pig production, ash constituted on average 77% of all K input, but for N and P, fertilisers were the dominant forms of input. Farm-gate balances for N, P and K were positive on all farms and were in the range 31-868 kg N ha -1 per year, 23-644 kg P ha-1 per year and 9-770 kg K ha-1 per year. The different production units were poorly integrated as nutrient output from one unit seldom matched nutrient demand, as estimated by nutrient output, in the next unit. All pig production units showed similar nutrient use efficiencies, but there were large differences between the crop units, varying greatly both among different crops, and for the same crop, among the farms. The crop units were characterised by large nutrient surpluses and low nutrient efficiencies, indicating a high risk for nutrient losses to the wider environment. The results highlight the farmers' need for better tools to optimise farm nutrient management, both through better integration of the production units, but especially also by improving crop nutrient use efficiency",annual crops;nutrient balance;nutrient management;nutrient use efficiency;orchard;peri-urban farming;pig production;smallholder farms;vietnam,nitrogen;nutrient budget;periurban area;phosphorus;potassium;smallholder;asia;eurasia;southeast asia;viet nam;fraxinus;sus scrofa,"Hedlund, A.; Department of Soil Sciences, Swed.

However, it has been widely depreciated by urban planning and city management, The purpose of the paper is to demonstrate that like many land use trends, urban agriculture is currently increasing both in rich and poor regions, in every possible latitudes. Research results from a diversity of countries, namely Brazil, Mozambique and Portugal have proved that local policy options for city farming as an environmentally sustainable land use are a new phenomenon and a welcomed initiative by a diversity of peoples. Conclusions will show that there is a wide acceptance of idle public inner and peri-urban land occupation, with horticulture practiced by less wealthy families. The vast majority of food growers inquired use organic fertilisers and produce healthy food. There are also examples of pedagogical gardens in kindergartens and schools where youngsters are stimulated to plant, weed compost, water and harvest the produce they eat in the schools canteens, whereas City Farms existent all over Europe tend to happily associate the urbanites with green spaces and animal keeping within city boundaries.

It is often portrayed as a coping strategy through which the urban poor have adapted to structural adjustment. It is enframed in an apolitical, ahistorical way because development institutions seek to create spaces into which development projects can be inserted in the future. This paper uses a case study from the town of Buea in south-west Cameroon to illustrate the differences between the international image of urban agriculture and its practice in one particular place. The increase in agricultural production in Buea in the 1990s initially appears to conform to the standard picture of urban farming as a recent, pragmatic and unplanned response to falling household incomes. However, such a portrayal neglects the history of urban farming, the pleasure that agriculture brings to farmers and the political consequences of expanding agricultural production. One of the concrete outcomes of increased urban agriculture in Buea in the 1990s has been to act as a 'safety valve' against social unrest. It has acted as an 'anti-politics machine'; a mechanism through which a sensitive political operation (reducing the salaries of civil servants) is achieved through apparently disconnected apolitical acts (enabling urban households to expand agricultural production).

This practice has been accelerated by the droughts of recent decades which have forced more and more migrants into urban areas. Numerous potential health hazards have been attributed to urban gardening but the exact risks in Sahelian areas remain unclear. The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to evaluate the incidence of diarrhea at the Tel Zatar gardening site in urban Nouakchott, Mauritania. In addition, a case-control study was carried out to identify risk factors for diarrhea in function of gardeners'activity and living conditions. Statistical analysis was performed using univariate and logistical regression methods. The annual incidence of diarrhea ranged from 6.9 (IC95p. 100=5.0-8.8) to 8.5 (IC95p. 100=6.2-10.8) episodes per gardener and year. Multivariate analysis identified four significant risk factors. Two of these factors were unrelated to gardening, i.e., not having spent more than USD 3.50 the previous day (odds ratio (OR=2.8, IC95p. 100=1.01-7.81) and poor food hygiene (cooking outside (OR=4.69, IC95p. 100=1.06-20.83). The other two factors were regular consumption of raw vegetables (OR=25.5, IC95p. 100=2.0-320) and use of untreated well water (OR=3.85, IC95 p. 100=1.08-14.29). Unprotected well water was the cause of 59.2 p. 100 of diarrheal episodes reported by gardeners at Tel Zatar.

Although previously 'invisible' to most developers and economists, urban farming is now recognised as playing a crucial subsistence role in the household economies of lower-income people living in major West African cities. But the practice does more than feed the urban poor. Using the example of Ziguinchor in Casamance, Senegal, it is argued that growing crops in peri-urban and intra-urban zones, on otherwise neglected or half-built-up land, also protects and enriches the city environment while increasing the primary productivity of the inhabitants. Directly, or in more subtle ways, the practice strengthens bonds of friendship, and promotes inter-ethnic co-operation while at the same time helping to maintain biological complexity in interesting and previously unexplored ways.

Apart from improving local food supplies, urban agriculture puts marginal lands to wise use and absorbs wastes in the form of compost. In 1994, Rutgers Urban Gardening (RUG) transformed 30 acres of city waste land in Newark, New Jersey into 1, 900 food gardens involving about 6, 500 city residents growing vegetables and other food crops worth over $915, 000. Nearly 4, 000 tons of city leaves were recycled and used as compost in these gardens. Feeding people in the cities is becoming a larger problem as more people flood into them. RUG played an outstanding role in producing fresh and nutritious food close to home at a reduced cost to the participants. Gardens also became places for social interaction.

The strategies were based on surveys of this building and a case study of a similar project in the Health Community Program in Buenos Aires, Argentina. The project staff negotiated with the landlord about legal liability, organized a tenants' committee, negotiated for a training program for transferring maintenance operations to the housing residents, developed effective skills in negotiating among residents, and developed working groups to deal with problems. Over the prior year, environmental health organizations provided health education to the residents of the building. The tenants' committee resolved to address the waste removal problem by hiring two unemployed men for waste removal. Tenants on each floor were assigned the responsibility of cleaning common public areas 1 day/week or face eviction. Tenants' proposed that vendors, who wandered through the building selling alcohol and other items, should operate out of a vacant ground floor space. A fair rental was determined in legal negotiations. A local engineering department was chosen to redesign the building at no cost. The Housing Department will train caretakers. The Department of Parks and Recreation will begin an urban gardening project. Residents volunteered to clean up a nearby park and 20 inner city blocks on a monthly basis beginning in 1995.

This account reports that 50-80% of average income is spent on food in nearly 50% of developing country's largest cities. Surveys conducted during the late 1980s confirm a range of 60-80% of income for expenditures on food. Surveys reveal that urban food costs are 10-30% higher than costs for rural dwellers. Urban household food production is a practice that has been around since the times of the Aztecs, the Incas, and Mayan cities. Reports survive of the Javanese and city dwellers along the Tigris and Euphrates producing their own food. Asian policy makers promote urban food production as critical to urban survival. Other factors influence urban food production. These factors include rapid urbanization, ineffective agricultural policies, inadequate food distribution systems, withdrawal of subsidies, reduction of wages, inflation, unemployment, lax urban regulations, civil strife, and drought. Government agencies are sometimes obstacles in outlawing the practice. Recent support for urban agriculture includes ten Asian, six African, and six Latin American countries. The number of urban farm workers is reported as 200 million worldwide. 700 million receive the benefits of urban agriculture. 25% of urban households in the US were engaged in urban food production during the 1980s. Better information, such as in comparative and longitudinal studies, is needed on urban poverty and the links between nutrition, income, employment, waste, and environmental issues. If cost-benefit analysis research finds a positive impact, then urban planners may need to incorporate city farming into conventional land use. The value of city farming needs to be assessed.

Findings revealed that farming in the urban environment is guided by the logic of survival since most of the farmers engaged in urban cultivation are mainly low-income earners and they farm mainly to reduce their expenses on food and to supplement the family's income. The major problem confronting farming in the area is competition from non-agricultural land uses. Nevertheless, more than half (50.5 percent) of the farmers, who had been approached to sell their farmlands for non-agricultural uses in the area, rejected the offer, indicating that the prospects of continued farming are thought to be good.

However, data from a 1985 survey suggest that the volume of urban agricultural production in Kenya is considerable. Most crops are grown and livestock kept for subsistence purposes by the urban poor, who rely on them for survival. Two thirds of urban Kenyans cannot afford to feed their families from their earnings, and about the same proportion produce subsistence food. Urban plots are more productive than rural plots, probably because of the use of water and organic inputs. There is more self-sufficient peasant farming in the smaller towns, and more information trade and barter in these inputs in the capital. Other components in the urban farming subsistence economy include woodfuel and hay from empty land, refuse for fodder, and wild indigenous vegetables, now being traded and domesticated. It would be easy to incorporate crop and livestock production into urban planning. The poor need local government services to support and enhance these activities. Such measures could enable African cities to become economically sustainable. -Auth",,agricultural produce;agricultural production;developing country;farming potential;policy implication;subsistence activity;subsistence economy;survey data;urban area;urban farming;urban planning;africa;kenya,,,,11832355,,,,English,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0026283870,2,,,,,activities;activity;afford;africa;african city;agricultural production;auth;barter;become;cannot;cannot afford;capital;cities;components;crop;crops;data;earnings;economy;empty land;enhance;families;feed;fodder;food;government;government service;grown;hay;include;include woodfuel;incorporate;incorporate crop;indigenous vegetable;information;information trade;inputs;kenya;kenyans;kept;land;livestock;livestock production;local government;marginal subsistence;measures;need;organic input;peasant;peasant farming;planning;plots;poor need;produce;produce subsistence;production;proportion;proportion produce;purposes;refuse;rural plot;selfsufficient;selfsufficient peasant;services;subsistence;subsistence activity;subsistence economy;subsistence food;subsistence purpose;suggest;support;survey;survey suggest;survival;thirds;towns;trade;urban farming;urban kenyan;urban planning;urban plot;use;vegetables;volume;water;wild;women;woodfuel,africa;urban farming,681

The spatial distribution, practices, motives and problems of urban cultivators were the focus of the study. The book is in three sections. Part one sets the context for a detailed examination of urban farming in Nairobi's open spaces. It draws on existing literature to explain the role of large Third World cities as magnets for rural underemployed and landless peasants and outlines the part played by the urban informal sector in directing new arrivals into activities and areas of the city that foster urban agriculture. Part two describes the nature, background, distribution, and practices of the urban farmers themselves. It begins with a brief overview of the role of food producers in a sample of six municipalities in Kenya. The questions of land tenure and occupance are analysed, with emphasis on the usufruct arrangements made by the sample of 618 urban cultivators interviewed during this study. The special position of women as the predominant group of urban cultivators is discussed, as well as details of cultivation practices and cropping patterns. Part three summarizes the role and significance of urban agriculture in Nairobi at the levels of the cultivator's family, the community, and the nation. It attempts to place these in a theoretical context, which may have broader application to the study of development in the Third World. -from Aut",,agricultural production;capital city;city farming;developing country;food production;informal sector;land tenure;open space;urban agriculture;urban area;kenya;nairobi,,,McGill-Queen's University Press,,0773508228; 9780773508224,,,English,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85040890450,1,,,,,activities;agriculture;application;areas;arrangements;arrivals;attempts;aut;author;author investigates;background;begins;book;brief;brief overview;broader;cities;city;community;component;context;cultivation;cultivation practice;cultivator family;cultivators;data;describes;detailed examination;details;development;distribution;draws;emphasis;examination;explain;family;farmers;field;field survey;focus;food;food producer;foster;group;informal sector;interviewed;investigates;kenya;land;land tenure;landless;landless peasant;levels;literature;littleunderstood;littleunderstood component;magnets;motives;municipalities;nairobi;nairobis;nation;nature;new arrival;occupance;open space;outlines;overview;part;patterns;peasants;place;played;position;practices;predominant;predominant group;problems;producers;questions;role;rural underemployed;sample;sections;sector;sets;significance;spaces;spatial distribution;special position;study;summarizes;survey;tenure;theoretical context;third world;urban agriculture;urban cultivator;urban farmer;urban farming;urban informal;usufruct;usufruct arrangement;women;world;world city,agriculture;city;farmer informal;farmers;informal urban;kenya;nairobi;open space;spaces;urban agriculture,682

This is in great contrast to research undertaken on shelter. The urban food supply system is a complex network of production, distribution and consumption linkages, but three main sources of food for the poor may be identified. First, there is the conventional retail sector which has become increasingly dominated by imported commodities and retailing methods, much of which is the consequence of changing dietary preferences and has led to growing food dependency. Not surprisingly, given the cost of food retailed through the conventional sector, the poor have sought alternative sources. The most obvious is through the operations of the petty-commodity or informal sector, but in addition a surprising amount of urban subsistence food is still produced within the cities of Asia and Africa. Clearly, these sectors are performing a useful function, but the ways in which and the extent to which their activities benefit the poor are still largely undocumented. -from Aut",,city farming;developing country;food distribution;food supply system;informal sector;policy implication;poverty alleviation;retail sector;supply system;urban agriculture;urban area;urban food distribution;africa;asia,,,,00167398,,,,English,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0026339755,1,,,,,activities;activity benefit;addition;africa;alternative;alternative source;amount;asia;aut;become;benefit;cities;commodities;complex network;consequence;consumption;consumption linkage;contrast;conventional sector;cost;countries;dependency;dietary preference;distribution;extent;food;food dependency;food supply;function;great contrast;informal sector;linkages;main source;met;methods;needs;network;operations;pettycommodity;preferences;production;research;research undertaken;retail sector;retailing;retailing method;sector;sectors;shelter;sought;sources;subsistence;subsistence food;supply;supply system;surprising;surprising amount;system;systems;urban food;urban subsistence;useful function;ways,africa;asia;distribution;food;food distribution;urban food,683

This article focuses on urban farmers, their spatial distribution and characteristics, cultivation practices, crop types, consumption patterns and crop produce disposal. It is concluded that urban agriculture contributes to food self-sufficiency and helps raise the nutritional standards of poor urban residents who are otherwise unemployed or holding down low-paying (juakali) occupations, particularly female-headed households.

These diverse patterns of symbolic discourse, or organizational cultures, are assessed in the case of the recent urban gardening movement. Although government agencies assisted the movement by providing resources to movement collectives and by establishing thousands of urban gardening projects, collectives and bureaucracies had different meanings for what appeared to be the same experience. A comparison of how each described the benefits of urban gardening and structured the gardening experience for participants show serious underlying differences between these organizational cultures and a source of potential bureaucratic/collectivist conflict. Implications for understanding apparent official opposition to collectivist movements are also assessed.
