The aim of this article is to investigate energy and economic implications related to the exploitation of RES in the transformation of an Italian social housing building-type into a NZEB. The research is based on a detailed energy audit procedure that includes cost-optimal assessment and compliance check with the legal requirements. A parametric analysis was performed to find out the technical building system configurations that verify the minimum share of RES established by the Italian regulations, and at the same time to assess global cost and payback period. The intersection between legal compliancy and cost-effectiveness narrows the field of applicable RES technologies that are limited to electric heat pump for heating and cooling coupled with PV system, and low size solar collectors coupled with low temperature generator for domestic hot water.

Due to the suitable solar potential available in Iran, the use of solar energy has been developed more than other renewable resources. In this paper, photovoltaic (PV) panels are hybridized with battery banks and the power grid to provide electricity for 100 residential units and by performing a techno-economic-environmental analysis on the use of different solar tracking systems PV power generation is maximized. The final aim of this paper is to find the optimum scenario for reaching the highest efficiency along with emissions that are within the standard range. Also, the effect of grid sell back on the results is estimated and a sensitivity analysis is performed to generalize the results for other economic and climate conditions. Results show that the use of the solar tracking system significantly reduces the number of needed panels, but this size reduction is not always cost-effective due to the high cost of tracking units. The vertical tracking system indicated the best cost-efficiency with 0.241 $/kWh cost of energy and an average of 23% improvement on the output power. Although the dual-axis tracker improved power production by 32%, it was less cost-efficient. Sensitivity analysis indicated that with 33% renewable fraction and slightly different initial costs, the optimum cost of energy will vary from 0.227 to 0.255 $/kWh. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Grid-connected; Hybrid photovoltaic; Renewable energy; Solar tracking","Cost benefit analysis; Cost effectiveness; Economic analysis; Electric power generation; Electric power transmission networks; Energy utilization; Fossil fuels; Housing; Sensitivity analysis; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Tracking (position); Climate condition; Environmental analysis; Environmental features; Photovoltaic panels; PV power generation; Renewable resource; Residential photovoltaic; Solar tracking systems; Electric power system economics","Kasaeian, A.; Faculty of New Sciences and Technologies, University of TehranIran; email: akasa@ut.ac.ir",,"Elsevier Ltd",13640321,,RSERF,,"English","Renewable Sustainable Energy Rev",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85085882670

Nevertheless, the adoption rate for solar photovoltaic technology among households remains low. A conceptual framework based on the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology was developed in this study in an attempt to understand nonusers' behavioural intention in adopting solar PV technology. This study aimed to examine how knowledge, price value, social influence, and facilitating conditions contribute to the behavioural intention of using solar PV systems in Malaysia. A total of 392 useable questionnaires were collected for statistical analysis using partial least square structural equation modelling. The empirical results demonstrated that price value had a greater positive effect on social influence compared with knowledge. Social influence has been more impactful on behavioural intention than facilitation conditions. Moreover, facilitating conditions mediate the relationship between social influence and behavioural intention to use a solar PV system. The implications in this study are useful for policymakers to increase the use of solar PV technology and to achieve the nation's aim in becoming a sustainable energy consumer. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Facilitating conditions; Knowledge transmission; Price value; Residential solar photovoltaic; Social influence; Sustainability; Unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT)","Economic and social effects; Energy security; Surveys; Transmissions; Alternative energy source; Electricity production; Facilitating conditions; Knowledge transmissions; Partial least square (PLS); Solar photovoltaic technology; Structural equation modelling; Unified theory of acceptance and use of technology; Solar power generation; conceptual framework; energy use; human behavior; least squares method; photovoltaic system; price dynamics; solar power; statistical analysis; technology adoption; Malaysia","Choong, Y.-O.; Faculty of Business and Finance, Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman, Jalan Universiti, Bandar Barat, Malaysia; email: choongyo@utar.edu.my",,"Elsevier Ltd",03014215,,ENPYA,,"English","Energy Policy",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85086450041

Most of the techno-economic studies consider distributed standalone photovoltaic generation with little consideration of community-based standalone photovoltaic systems. Location-based case studies are required to provide economic and reliable photovoltaic systems to meet the peak loads of residential neighbourhoods in an optimized manner. This paper devises an integrated evaluation methodology; a combination of white-box energy modelling and black box photovoltaic design optimization. This research uses optimization methods to develop a quantitative optimized model for analysing the opportunities of centralized systems to adequately meet the demands of a residential neighbourhood and support the grid. This analysis includes three metrics including the level of the energy production, reliability of system for peak power and finally the capital cost of implementation in residential districts. Results indicate that the size of a centralized photovoltaic installation is less when compared to distributed installations to support a similar single peak load. The required converter size is reduced for the centralized system owing to the reduced system size. Centralized installations require fewer batteries to store surplus energy produced due to increased interaction of energy flows. Centralized installations are economically more viable than distributed ones. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Economic performance; Feasibility analysis; Homer; Optimization; PV Panels; Techno-economic","Housing; Photovoltaic cells; Reliability analysis; Integrated evaluation; Photovoltaic generation; Photovoltaic installation; Photovoltaic systems; Renewable energy technologies; Residential districts; Stand alone photovoltaic system; Techno-economic studies; Installation; energy efficiency; energy planning; feasibility study; installation; neighborhood; photovoltaic system; residential energy","Aghamolaei, R.; School of Mechanical and Materials Engineering, UCD Energy Institute, University College Dublin, Belfield, Ireland; email: r.aghamolaei@ut.ac.ir",,"Elsevier Ltd",09601481,,,,"English","Renew.

For a highly insulated building, the results show a maximum energy reduction (−30%) considering a photovoltaic (PV) panels and a battery storage. However, the installation of solar thermal (ST) panels (−24%) results financially more advantageous over a 20-year period. Considering a medium insulated building, the PV installation is the most profitable solution (−25%) considering both energy and economic aspects.

Policymakers are then faced with the task of assessing alternative ways to manage and organize the electricity grid and market. This work explores the potential of P2P energy trading under different available technologies and market paradigms, by analysing the economic benefits for residential consumers and prosumers, given different solar generation contexts and load flexibility levels. The model is applied to the Portuguese residential sector. Results show that with best techno-economic sizing solution for solar photovoltaic (PV), the greater economic gains come from flexibility, reaching a maximum of 28% for consumers and 55% for prosumers, in a P2P trading scenario. However, if we consider flexibility and a high-solar fraction PV sizing, the savings would reach 29% for consumers and 113% for prosumers. P2P economic benefits are found to depend on the type of participating agents involved, demand profile, PV surplus and monetization schemes, level of flexible equipment, which will greatly influence which trading strategies work best, meaning that each case study needs a tailored P2P trading scheme. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Distributed energy resources; Load flexibility; Peer-to-peer energy trading; Self-consumption","Economic analysis; Economic and social effects; Electric power transmission networks; Housing; Power markets; Renewable energy resources; Smart power grids; Solar power generation; Economic benefits; Electricity grids; Renewable energy systems; Residential consumers; Residential sectors; Smart Grid technologies; Solar photovoltaics; Trading strategies; Peer to peer networks; alternative energy; assessment method; energy efficiency; energy market; photovoltaic system; power generation; residential location; smart grid; solar power; tariff structure; Portugal","Neves, D.; IN+, Instituto Superior Técnico, Av.

This paper studied and modelled a smart home with a novel hybrid heating system, which consists of a wall-hung gas boiler (for both space and water heating) that is connected to a water tank with an auxiliary electric resistance heater (for water heating), and auxiliary split air conditioners (for space heating). A multi-objective optimization was further formulated to optimally schedule the gas and electricity consumption of a smart home equipped with the hybrid heating system as well as an onsite photovoltaic (PV) system, a battery energy storage system, an electric vehicle and various types of flexile loads. Two objectives, i.e. the minimization of operating energy cost (including both electricity and gas payment) and the maximization of thermal comfort, were considered. The optimization problem was finally transformed to a single objective mixed integer linear programming problem that can be solved by existing optimization solvers. Simulation results verified the operational performance of the studied hybrid heating system and the effectiveness of the proposed scheduling method. Sensitivity analysis was conducted considering various levels of electricity/gas prices, onsite PV capacity, battery capacity and outdoor air temperature, and it shows that in all the scenarios the operating energy cost of the smart home with the hybrid heating system was always lower than that with the pure electricity or pure gas heating systems. The performance under various uncertainties and the benefits of adopting model predictive control were also demonstrated. It is noted that this paper only focuses on the optimal scheduling and operation costs of the hybrid heating system. Optimal configuration and sizing of the heating system with the initial investment (i.e. capital expenditures) considered are identified as research directions in the future. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Electric power consumption; Gas consumption; Hybrid heating system; Integrated energy system; Optimal scheduling; Smart home","Air conditioning; Automation; Boilers; Cost benefit analysis; Electric energy storage; Electric power utilization; Energy utilization; Gas heating; Gases; Integer programming; Investments; Model predictive control; Multiobjective optimization; Scheduling; Secondary batteries; Sensitivity analysis; Water tanks; Battery energy storage systems; Electric heating systems; Electric resistance heaters; Electricity-consumption; Household energy consumption; Mixed integer linear programming problems; Operational performance; Outdoor-air temperature; Costs; control system; electric vehicle; electricity generation; energy storage; equipment; gas; heating; linear programing; optimization","Zhou, Y.; School of Engineering, Cardiff University, Queen's Buildings, The Parade, United Kingdom; email: ZhouY68@cardiff.ac.uk",,"Elsevier Ltd",03605442,,ENEYD,,"English","Energy",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85085712200

In this research study, a CCHP system equipped with photovoltaic/thermal (PVT) panels and micro-gas turbine (MGT) along with an absorption chiller, is proposed to supply not only the power demand of a building but also the cooling and heating demands. Different controllers are employed in the different parts of the CCHP system to handle the energy by monitoring the outside temperature in a smart manner. Dynamic simulation of the CCHP system is conducted from thermodynamic and economic standpoints, using TRNSYS software. Moreover, considering the annual exergy efficiency and unit product cost as objective functions, the optimization is carried out in the TRNOPT tool. Research outputs revealed that integrating an MGT and PVT with different auxiliary components, is able to provide both heating and cooling demands of the building. Also, the proposed system can produce an excess power of 715.32 kW.h, which can compensate for some house expenses by selling the power to the grid. The integrated hybrid MGT-PVT system yields an overall exergy efficiency of 48.01% and a total unit product cost of 8.39 €/(MW.h) in optimum point. This great economic outcome is mainly due to the low natural gas price in Iran, which is nearly 0.95 €/GJ. Additionally, the MGT-PVT microgeneration system can create both heat and power in the most environment-friendly manner suchlike it generates only annual pollution of 0.16 ton/(MW.h). © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","And exergy optimization; Cost; Integrated Building Energy system; Optimization; Parametric analysis; Transient simulation","Absorption cooling; Computer software; Cooling systems; Cost accounting; Electric power transmission networks; Exergy; Natural gas; Economic standpoints; Environment friendly; Microgeneration systems; Objective functions; Photovoltaic/thermal; Residential building; Techno-economic assessment; Transient optimizations; Heating","Hanafizadeh, P.; School of Mechanical Engineering, College of Engineering, University of Tehran, P.O.

In China, the government implemented a single, nation-wide net-metering subsidy to cultivate the distributed photovoltaic electricity generation market in 2013 and then had to reduce it twice due to the falling cost of photovoltaic modules and the large resultant financial gap. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether these subsidy adjustments were accurate, and also to identify the factors affecting the subsidy design. We applied a techno-economic evaluation to examine the actual market performance of China's household distributed photovoltaic system in five typical cities with different levels of solar radiation and electricity consumption patterns, and then investigated the subsidy policy's effectiveness through a cost-benefit analysis. The results show that a 3–7 kW photovoltaic capacity in different regions of solar radiation can meet the residential electricity demand. We found that the examination of net-metering effectiveness should consider both regional difference in solar radiation and the different levels of electricity demand. Additionally, the cost-benefit analysis also indicated that a reasonable, regionally differentiated metering subsidy should be in the range of 0.05–0.27 yuan/kWh. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Cost-benefit analysis; Distributed photovoltaic power generation; Net-metering policy; Techno-economic evaluation","Commerce; Costs; Economic analysis; Electric power utilization; Photovoltaic cells; Solar power generation; Solar radiation; Electricity consumption patterns; Photovoltaic electricities; Photovoltaic modules; Photovoltaic systems; Regional differences; Renewable energy technologies; Residential Electricity demands; Techno-economic evaluation; Cost benefit analysis","Zou, H.; College of Management and Economics, Tianjin UniversityChina; email: zouhongyang@tju.edu.cn",,"Elsevier Ltd",09596526,,JCROE,,"English","J.

This paper presents a techno-economic feasibility case study of biomass gasification in off-grid and grid-connected mini-grids for community-scale energy application in rural Uttar Pradesh, India. Energy demand data was collected through surveys in a village with irrigation and agro-processing loads and off-grid households and used to construct a seasonal load profile based on statistical methods. This was used to simulate single-source and hybrid mini-grids based on solar PV, biomass gasification and diesel generation using HOMER Pro. Hybrid PV-biomass or PV-diesel systems were found to offer the highest reliability for off-grid power at the lowest cost. Single-source PV was cheaper than biomass gasification, though the cost of electricity is highly sensitive to biomass supply and gasifier maintenance. Both renewable options were around half the cost of diesel generation. The findings held across grid-connected systems with weak, moderate and strong reliability of grid supply. This suggests that biomass gasification-based mini-grids are not cost-competitive with PV unless the two generation sources are combined in a hybrid system, though they require operational testing prior to implementation. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Biomass gasification; India; Mini-grid; Renewable energy; Rural electrification; Solar PV","Agricultural wastes; Biomass; Diesel engines; Gas generators; Gasification; Hybrid systems; Rural areas; Biomass Gasification; India; Mini grids; Renewable energies; Rural electrification; Solar PVs; Electric power transmission networks; alternative energy; biomass; burning; diesel engine; electricity generation; photovoltaic system; policy implementation; smart grid; solar power; India; Uttar Pradesh","Hallett, J.P.; Department of Chemical Engineering, Imperial College London, Exhibition Road, South Kensington, United Kingdom; email: j.hallett@imperial.ac.uk",,"Elsevier Ltd",09601481,,,,"English","Renew.

However, residential adoption rates vary across the country with potential for increasing uptake, particularly on apartment buildings and rental properties. This study focuses on past and future motivations for the adoption of rooftop solar panels and the barriers people perceive upon adoption. An online survey was conducted with 1126 respondents across Australia showing that 65% of those who had no solar panels were intending to adopt them. Results of best-worst scaling showed that motivations for past and future adoptions did not differ significantly and that economic motivations predominated, particularly for homeowners. Renters, a group often overlooked in the production of solar energy, strongly desired solar panels, often for environmental reasons, but were discouraged by uncertainties about the costs and benefits of installing solar. This reveals a need for policies that help renters and landlords, and those in multi-unit dwellings, to find ways in which the costs and benefits can be shared equitably.

Despite several existing work dedicated to the evaluation of photovoltaic battery system, the research on system sizing and operation strategy of the household system still has substantial areas to be explored such as techno-economic analysis under different electricity tariffs and comprehensive parametric analyses. In this paper, the mathematical model of a photovoltaic battery system is developed to investigate system performance, based on the various economic and technical indicators. This study demonstrates that the integration of battery energy storage could increase the value of self-consumption and self-sufficiency rates while making payback period longer. Substantial photovoltaic battery systems have been simulated under practical dynamic electricity tariffs in a typical electricity market. Eight cases with different technical performances from the recommended reference combinations are compared and studied in detail. The energy flows among photovoltaic, battery bank, grid and household user are discussed, revealing that systems with high self-sufficiency rate lead to more schedulable photovoltaic production, sold electricity and lower battery usage rate than those with high self-consumption rate. Besides, the entire lifecycle economic analysis indicates that a higher self-sufficiency rate refers to higher initial investment but shorter payback period and larger profit. The revenues breakdown of the cases shows that subsidies have a significant impact, especially for cases with high self-sufficiency rate.

This paper proposes a novel economic structure between the residential consumers and the International Energy Agency (IEA) to determine the energy label of the smart residential buildings within the framework of the energy efficiency policies. The proposed structure is a developed model of the existing national certificates, such as Energy Star. In the proposed method, the concept of the energy labeling was improved based on the optimization problem by considering the hourly injected energy from the utility to buildings and annual energy consumption. In addition, an incentive mechanism was designed to encourage volunteer customers to change their consumption patterns based on the presented energy labeling structure. The incentive mechanism is flexible and can be changed by the system operator considering the energy label variation. Different practical methods, which included the economic heat and electrical demands model, building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV), and building integrated plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV), were evaluated to promote the energy label of the residential building. For practical implementation, the proposed structure was applied to a sample smart residential building in East-Azerbaijan of Iran, and it was solved using GAMS software. The numerical results based on realistic data validated the effectiveness of the presented practical methods within the framework of the introduced energy labeling structure. According to the obtained results, the energy label index of the selected test system was promoted from F to E in the presence of the economic demand model and PHEV and promoted to D by using the economic demand model and BIPV system. In addition, the amount of energy injected into the building was decreased by up to 2.52% through the economic demand and PHEV schemes and up to 17.22% in the presence of the BIPV system. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Economic analysis; Energy efficiency; Energy labeling system; Energy policy design; Residential customer","Economic analysis; Energy utilization; Housing; Labels; Numerical methods; Plug-in hybrid vehicles; Annual energy consumption; Building integrated photovoltaic; Energy efficiency policies; Energy efficiency programs; Energy labeling; International energy agency; Plug in hybrid electric vehicles; Residential customers; Energy efficiency","Mohammadi-Ivatloo, B.; Smart Energy Systems Laboratory, Faculty of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Tabriz, 29 Bahman Blvd, Iran; email: bmohammadi@tabrizu.ac.ir",,"Elsevier Ltd",09596526,,JCROE,,"English","J.

This study integrated system dynamics modeling with life cycle assessment and life cycle cost assessment to evaluate the cumulative energy demand, carbon footprint, water footprint, and life cycle cost of residential grid-connected (GC) and standalone (SA) solar PV systems. The system dynamics model was specifically used for simulating the hourly solar energy generation, use, and storage during the use phase of the solar PVs. The modeling framework was then applied to a residential prototype house in Boston, MA to investigate various PV panel and battery sizing scenarios. When the SA design is under consideration, the maximum life cycle economic saving can be achieved with 20 panels with no battery in the prototype house, which increases the life cycle economic savings by 511.6% as compared to a baseline system sized based upon the engineering rule-of-thumb (40 panels and 40 batteries), yet decreases the demand met by 55.7%. However, the optimized environmental performance was achieved with significantly larger panel (up to 300 units) and battery (up to 320 units) sizes. These optimized configurations increase the life cycle environmental savings of the baseline system byup to 64.6%, but significantly decrease the life cycle economic saving by up to 6868.4%. There is a clear environmental and economic tradeoff when sizing the SA systems. When the GC system design is under consideration, both the economic and environmental benefits are the highest when no battery is installed, and the benefits increase with the increase of panel size. However, when policy constraints such as limitations/caps of grid sell are in place, tradeoffs would present as whether or not to install batteries for excess energy storage. © 2020","Battery storage; Grid-connected and standalone PV systems; Life cycle assessment; Life cycle costing; Solar photovoltaic systems; System dynamics modeling","Battery storage; Carbon footprint; Costs; Ecodesign; Electric batteries; Environmental impact; Environmental management; Housing; Photovoltaic cells; Solar concentrators; Solar energy; Solar power generation; System theory; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Life cycle costing; Solar photovoltaic system; Stand-alone PV systems; System dynamics model; Life cycle; assessment method; design; environmental economics; life cycle analysis; photovoltaic system; residential development; solar power; spatiotemporal analysis; Article; carbon footprint; controlled study; energy conservation; environmental impact assessment; environmental policy; life cycle assessment; priority journal; process optimization; solar energy; solar radiation; spatiotemporal analysis; Boston; Massachusetts; United States","Mo, W.35 Colovos Road, 334 Gregg Hall, United States; email: weiwei.mo@unh.edu",,"Elsevier B.V.",00489697,,STEVA,"32208273","English","Sci.

In this perspective, dispatch strategy based performance analysis has been carried out to provide power supply using the hybrid renewable energy system for a remote rural area in the state of Karnataka (India). The effect of load following, cycle charging and combined dispatch strategies on Lead Acid and Lithium-Ion batteries with Photovoltaic/Hydro/Battery and Photovoltaic/Wind/Hydro/Diesel Generator/Battery configurations has been studied using Hybrid Optimization Model for Electric Renewable (HOMER Pro®). The feasible Cost of Energy and Net Present Cost obtained for the proposed hybrid system are found in the range of 0.1 $/kWh – 0.162 $/kWh, $4,65,790 – $7,16,658 under the proposed dispatch strategies.

The integration of intermittent renewable energy resources such as photovoltaic (PV) systems has led to a large variation in energy production and increased supply uncertainty in power systems. In this context, demand-side management (DSM) schemes can be used to motivate prosumers to refine their energy behaviours by offering them various incentives. This study presents a universally-applied methodology that will promote the deployment of effective price-based DSM for residential prosumers. The proposed methodology can be applied on both prosumers and consumers since the utilization of the net-load profile was found to reduce the percentage of unintended revenues by 15%. Additionally, the effectiveness of the methodology was validated through a pilot-network of 300 residential prosumers with installed rooftop PV systems, and resulted in seasonally dependent peak consumption reduction in the range of 1.03% and 3.19% and a reduction of the overall consumption by approximately 2%. Finally, the conducted cost-benefit analysis demonstrated an overall net-benefit of €4.62mln, over a 15-year period, when considering assumptions that are linked to the costs and benefits of a nationwide deployment of the proposed DSM scheme. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Demand side management; Grid integration; Photovoltaics; Time-of-use tariffs","Costs; Demand side management; Electric utilities; Housing; Renewable energy resources; Consumption reductions; Current generation; Electricity networks; Energy productions; Grid integration; Photovoltaic systems; Photovoltaics; Time-of-use tariffs; Cost benefit analysis; alternative energy; consumption behavior; cost analysis; cost-benefit analysis; demand-side management; electricity generation; photovoltaic system; power plant; price dynamics; residential energy","Venizelou, V.; PV Technology Laboratory, FOSS Research Centre for Sustainable Energy, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of CyprusCyprus; email: venizelou.venizelos@ucy.ac.cy",,"Elsevier Ltd",09601481,,,,"English","Renew.

Nevertheless, a strong contraction of PV investment can be observed in Italy during the last period due to the closure of the feed-in-tariff mechanism. For this reason, new opportunities have been introduced by the Italian Government to support investment in the residential sector: net-metering, tax deduction and a novel regulatory scheme where PV production can be exchanged between an end-user and an energy-provider free of network charges. In this context, an economic assessment for PV installations in residential households is presented in this paper considering the benefits derived by the combination of these supporting schemes presently available in Italy. Increasing electricity consumptions of residential end-user are considered to explore the feasibility of PV installation in different configurations. Geographical information system is used here as a supporting tool to take into account the variation of solar radiation resource across the country, since economic results are influenced by the match between energy consumption and PV production.

The energy crisis in Pakistan has become the prime stumbling block in the economic development of the country. There are many industrial processes that need uninterrupted supply; even a trivial outage can cost millions of dollars. The main cause of ""load shedding"" in Pakistan is that it produces a major portion of its energy from fossil fuels, whose price and demand is constantly increasing. Most of the customers at industrial and commercial level use Diesel Generator (DiG) as a reliable alternative source of electrical power when grid supply is unavailable. The use of DiG during loading shedding hours would increase the Cost of Energy (COE) per kWh and also enhance environmental emissions. Pakistan has a wide range of renewable power sources like bioenergy, wind, solar, hydel, geothermal etc. The distinct emphasis on the implementation of an industrial microgrid in Faisalabad, Pakistan has been specified in this paper. The prospective benefits of the microgrid fall into three major kinds: cost reduction, fuel saving, and improved environmental emissions. The optimized objective of this work is to maximize these benefits. Moreover while designing the hybrid microgrid system it encounters many design challenges like sizing of the components, system feasibility, COE, system reliability etc. This study contributes to the ongoing studies about hybrid microgrid system and draws attention to the optimal design and sizing considering several techno-economic factors including Net Present Cost (NPC), COE, supply reliability, capacity shortage constraint, battery state of charge (SOC), dispatch strategy, PV power generation and PV array tracking systems. Different cases are studied; microgrid sizing, techno-economic exploration, sensitivity analysis and environmental effects are addressed using (Hybrid Optimization Model for Electric Renewables) HOMER. The results show that COE and environmental emissions have been significantly reduced for the proposed system. © 2020, Strojarski Facultet.

The configuration of a solar photovoltaic system integrating energy storage in Portugal is yet unclear in the technical, energetic and economic point of view. The energy management jointly with the battery operation have great influence in the system configuration's profitability value. The present work evaluates different photovoltaic system configurations with and without batteries for the normal low voltage Portuguese consumer profile with 3.45 kVA contracted power. This study presents the systems’ cost-effectiveness, within the Portuguese legislation, which promotes and enables policies for self-generation and self-consumption. The analysis is done in three different representative locations of the country, considering distinct electric tariffs. This work shows that despite the solar photovoltaic system without electricity storage is already economically viable, its integration with storage is not in most of the assessed configurations.

Experiments on a photovoltaic (PV) and battery storage system under maximizing self-consumption and time-of-use strategies are conducted to study the system performance and validate energy balance based battery and energy management models. Four renewable application scenarios are investigated for a typical high-rise building in Hong Kong through coupled modelling and optimizations with TRNSYS and jEPlus + EA. A comprehensive technical optimization criterion integrating the energy supply, battery storage, building demand and grid relief indicators is developed, and the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) considering detailed renewables benefits including the feed-in tariff, transmission loss saving, network expansion saving and carbon reduction benefit is formulated. Experimental results show that root mean square deviations between the tested and simulated battery state of charge for the two strategies are 1.49% and 0.94% respectively. It is indicated that the PV system covers 16.02% of the annual load at a LCOE of 0.5252 US$/kWh and the PV-wind system covers 53.65% of the annual load at the lowest LCOE of 0.1251 $/kWh.

The load profile of a property greatly affects the self-consumption rate and, thus, the profitability of the system. Therefore, insights from analyses of residential applications, which are well studied, cannot simply be transferred to other types of properties. In comparison to residential applications, PV is especially suitable for municipal buildings, due to their better match of demand and supply. In order to analyze the value of additional batteries, municipal PV battery systems of different sizes were simulated, taking load profiles of 101 properties as inputs. It was found that self-consumption differs significantly from households, while different types of municipal buildings are largely similar in terms of the indicators analyzed. The share of electricity consumed during summertime was found to have the most significant impact on the self-consumption rate for most considered system sizes. Due to lower electricity tariffs and lower increases in self-consumption provided through batteries in municipal buildings, the investment into a battery is not economically advantageous in most of the cases considered. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Battery storage; Energy economics; Grid integration; Linear programming; Photovoltaic energy","Battery storage; Costs; Housing; Investments; Linear programming; Profitability; Electricity prices; Electricity tariff; Energy economics; Grid integration; Municipal buildings; Photovoltaic electricities; Photovoltaic energy; Residential application; Electric batteries; building; electricity; energy storage; integrated approach; photovoltaic system; profitability","Weidlich, A.; Department of Sustainable Systems Engineering, University of FreiburgGermany; email: anke.weidlich@inatech.uni-freiburg.de",,"Elsevier Ltd",09601481,,,,"English","Renew.

To this end, a techno-economic model is proposed that enables to quantify the increase in self-consumption of electricity from a solar photovoltaic system by means of a home battery storage system. Regarding battery aging, we find that the longest battery lifetimes can be achieved with the highest state-of-charge limit, which is, however, not economically preferable due to limited self-consumption. Three pooling concepts presently promoted in Germany are studied as well (Sonnen, Caterva, Fenecon). Although one of the three battery pooling concepts was identified as not being economical, namely the case of Sonnen, our evaluation shows that profitability can, in principle, be achieved with home battery pooling concepts. We find that the battery lifetime varies greatly from 11.6–26.5 years, depending on the state-of-charge limits set, with important economic implications on the overall cost effectiveness, and that the level of self-consumption of PV power is about 67.5% in the reference case, compared to 59.4–66.4% for the three battery pooling models analyzed. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Battery aging; Battery storage; Cost effectiveness; Home battery pooling; Solar photovoltaics","Charging (batteries); Cost effectiveness; Costs; Lithium compounds; Lithium-ion batteries; Photovoltaic cells; Solar power generation; Battery lifetime; Battery storage system; Economic impacts; Economic implications; Economic viability; Private households; Solar photovoltaic system; Techno-economic model; Battery storage","Madlener, R.; Institute for Future Energy Consumer Needs and Behavior (FCN), School of Business and Economics / E.ON Energy Research Center, RWTH Aachen University, Mathieustrasse 10, Germany; email: RMadlener@eonerc.rwth-aachen.de",,"Elsevier Ltd",2352152X,,,,"English","J.

Improving building energy efficiency across all categories of buildings is one key goal of the European energy policies, made prominent by the Climate and Energy package, Energy Performance of Building Directive and Energy Efficiency Directive. In this study, the profitability of an on-site combined heat and power supply system for an office building is investigated. A reference model utilizing solely district heating was constructed and used for validation purposes. Then, a photovoltaic assisted ground source heat pump model was developed and investigated with and without electrical storage to reveal the most cost-effective investment scenario in cold climate regions. The reference model was validated using consumption data provided by the facility owner, after which an investigation of the energy saving potential along with the economic viability of adapting a new heat- and power supply system was conducted. It was concluded that a ground source heat pump in combination with a standalone rooftop photovoltaic system, was successful in satisfying thermal requirements while lowering the building specific energy demand compared to utilizing a district heating system.

Among these are financially distressed cities and neighborhoods that are facing enormous challenges without the scientific and technical capacity for planning and mitigation. The city of Camden is one of those economically distressed areas with a predominantly minority population, a high unemployment rate, high poverty rates, and poor air quality (PM2.5 and ozone), and it remains vulnerable to heat events. This paper focuses on studying a coupled effect of Urban Heat Islands (UHIs) and Ozone-PM2.5 pollution at the neighborhood-scale in the city of Camden, using fine scale remotely sensed land-surface temperature and air quality data from the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) Modelling System in the Geographic Information Systems (GIS) platform. To assess the impact of urban microclimate on the city of Camden, NJ, residents' health, we identified several environmental and social parameters as the root causes of vulnerability imposed by extreme-heat and poor air quality. Vulnerability in terms of environment and social wellbeing was spatially quantified as two conceptual vulnerability-index models (i.e., environmental vulnerability index (EVI) and a social vulnerability index (SVI)) using multiple linear regression algorithm. Factors such as remotely sensed earth surface properties, built-environment components, air quality, and socio-economic data were incorporated in a holistic geographic approach to quantify the combined effect. Surface temperature gradient and Proportional Vegetation (Pv) generated from 30 m resolution Landsat 8 were sampled along with other variables in the city of Camden, NJ. Models incorporating Pv suggest better fit than models with normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Water fraction (33.5%,32.4%), percentage imperviousness (32.5%, 32%), Pv (20.5%, 19.6%), and digital elevation model (DEM) (9%, 8%) have the highest contributions in both models. Two output maps identified the vulnerable neighborhoods in the city through comprehensive GIS analysis: Lanning Square, Bergen Square, Central Waterfront, Gateway, Liberty Park, and Parkside. This can provide useful information for planners and health officials in targeting areas for future interventions and mitigations. © 2020 by the authors.","Air quality; CMAQ; Environmental risk; Impact index; Social risk; UHI",,"Sabrin, S.; Department of Civil Construction and Environmental Engineering, University of Alabama at BirminghamUnited States; email: sabrins8@uab.edu",,"MDPI AG",22209964,,,,"English","ISPRS Int.

This opens a difficult challenge, especially in the urban areas where the availability of room for the installation of renewable plants is limited. This paper considers a university campus in the center of Lisbon that requires a significant amount of electricity and natural gas to support the internal activities. The idea is to fulfil part of the energy consumption of the campus with the excess of energy supplied by solar systems installed in the surrounding residential buildings. The goal is to find the number and type of solar equipment that maximize the reduction of annual energy costs of both residents and campus, where the campus is seen as a virtual storage. Results of the optimization show that, considering the best-exposed 100 buildings in a radius of 500 m around the campus, the campus can reduce the annual energy expenses up to 8.61%, whereas the money-saving for the residents is of the order of 24% to 29%, depending on solar exposure.

Taking economic benefit maximization, environmental benefit maximization and energy efficiency maximization as sub-objectives, the mathematical model of multi-objective optimal allocation and operation strategy of the energy internet is established considering supply-demand balance constraints, equipment characteristic constraints, operation mode constraints, and energy conditions constraints. The calculation results show that without considering the outsourced electricity, the balanced strategy, the economic development strategy, the environmental protection strategy, and the energy efficiency strategy are obtained by calculation, which are all superior to the traditional energy supply strategy. Moreover, considering the outsourced electricity, the proportion of outsourced electricity to total electricity is 19.8%, which is the system optimization of the energy internet under certain power demand. Compared with other strategies without outsourced electricity, the outsourced electricity strategy can have a certain emission reduction effect, but at the same time reduce the economic benefit. Furthermore, the huge difference in demand for thermal and cooling load between industrial and commercial areas results in the installed capacity of gas distributed energy stations in industrial areas being nearly twice as large as that in commercial areas.

The proposed microgrid operates in a large number of grid-connected and off-grid operation modes. The EMS includes a long-Term data prediction unit based on a 2-D dynamic programing and a short-Term fuzzy controller. The long-Term prediction unit is designed to determine the appropriate variation range of the battery state of charge and FC state of hydrogen. The efficiency performance of the microgrid components, predicted energy generation and demand, energy cost, and the system constraints are taken into account. The resultant data then are sent to the short-Term fuzzy controller which determines the operation mode of the microgrid based on the real-Time condition of the microgrid elements.

Therefore, to handle this issue and enhance the system profitability, advanced energy management strategies should be developed. To that end, this paper proposes to assess the relevance of an energy management strategy based on 48-hour horizon compared to a 24-hour horizon one in order to perform energy arbitrage. This study considers a residential microgrid based on photovoltaic generation and storage connected to the main grid. Proposed 48-hour energy management strategy provides additional management possibilities such as the ability to delay trades (charge today, discharge tomorrow) and a larger range of hours to use the storage. Particle Swarm Optimizer is used to solve the optimization part. Besides, a sensitivity analysis is investigated to assess the economic impact of forced storage of solar surplus power in order to increase self-consumption rate and storage size. Obtained results demonstrates better profitability by using proposed strategy. Profitability was improved by more than 11% compared to classical algorithms for the tested scenarios. The findings of this study illustrate that the use of 48-hour horizon-based energy management strategy can be more profitable and lead residential microgrids to decrease their operation cost and increase power balance for all grid stakeholders through feed-in price leverage. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Energy management strategies; Energy storage system; Grid services; Residential microgrid; Self-consumption; Weather forecast uncertainties","Battery management systems; Chemical contamination; Commerce; Electric energy storage; Housing; Microgrids; Particle size analysis; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Profitability; Secondary batteries; Sensitivity analysis; Storage management; Weather forecasting; Energy management strategies; Energy storage systems; Forecast uncertainty; Grid services; Residential microgrid; Self-consumption; Energy management systems","Vincent, R.; IREENA Laboratory, Université de Nantes, 37 boulevard de l'universite, BP 406, France; email: remy.vincent@2016.icam.fr",,"Elsevier Ltd",2352152X,,,,"English","J.

Nonetheless, increased PV integration may introduce several technical problems regarding the secure operation of distribution grids. Battery energy storage (BES) systems can mitigate such challenges, but the high capital cost is one of the most important limiting factors towards the widespread use of these systems. In fact, the financial viability of integrated PV and BES systems under different support schemes remains an open issue. In this study, the profitability of PV and BES systems is evaluated through an advanced techno-economic model, that provides the optimal size of PV-BES system in terms of net present value, based on the electricity production and consumption profile of the installation, PV and BES systems costs, and electricity charges.

A number of passive, active and renewable energy efficient measures (EEMs) have been selected and defined. Based on the level of energy saving potentials, these EEMs have been combined into 18 retrofit combination packages (COMBs) and grouped into various retrofit levels (Moderate Retrofit-I, II, III and Extensive Retrofit). The annual primary energy consumptions (heating, hot water and electricity) for the proposed combination packages were simulated in IESVE building energy simulation software. This is then followed by two levels of assessments: i) the comprehensive assessments of the key retrofit priorities including primary energy reduction, global costs, payback period and the carbon emission reduction and ii) social assessment with the aim to represent various stakeholders’ views on the selected COMBs using a metric of weighting factors. Based on this, a multi-criteria assessment approach featuring a novel ranking factor (EEES) taking into account of energy, economic, environmental and social aspects during retrofit process was adopted. This approach quantifies different stakeholders’ perspectives on the proposed COMBs, which could enable various stakeholders’ involvement in the retrofit decision making process. It was concluded that COMB 05 and 06, which include only 2–3 passive and active EEMs have been ranked and chosen as the most favourable retrofit solutions, with EEES value equalled to 25.6 from various stakeholders’ perspectives. The impacts of changing renewable energy prices and PV generated feed-in tariff rates on the global costs, carbon reductions and primary energy consumptions of the proposed COMBs, which have rarely been analysed in literature, are numerically investigated in this research. Such renewable EEMs which are greatly recommended by the European Commission, are expected to gain further support from national level government renewable incentives. Therefore, it is envisaged that in the long term, Extensive Retrofits incorporating mostly renewable EEMs could become more affordable and cost effective. © 2019","Building retrofit; Carbon emission; Cost-optimal analysis; Multi-criteria approach; Social assessment","Carbon; Computer software; Cost benefit analysis; Cost effectiveness; Cost reduction; Decision making; Economic and social effects; Emission control; Energy utilization; Housing; Investments; Retrofitting; Social aspects; Building retrofits; Carbon emissions; Multi-criteria approach; Optimal analysis; Social assessment; Energy efficiency","Chen, X.; Centre for Renewable Energy Systems Technologies (CREST), Wolfson School of Mechanical, Electrical and Manufacturing Engineering, Loughborough University, LE11 3TU, United Kingdom; email: xiangjie.chen@nottingham.ac.uk",,"Elsevier Ltd",03787788,,ENEBD,,"English","Energy Build.",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85081135886

Now, renewable energy is a significant issue that must be considered seriously as a policy and in order to achieve energy sustainability on a global scale especially in whole developing countries. Also, since the role of renewable energy in sustainable development is remarkable, thus this article presents a comprehensive discussion of energy sustainability for urban areas with related energy indicators and technical analysis of a Hybrid Power System to show the importance of renewable energy to gain energy sustainability. This paper presents the feasibility of using PV-DG hybrid systems as the reliable energy by an economic and technical analysis in one of the southern cities of Iran use of HOMER software. Regarding the high average of solar radiation that is about 5.4 kWh/m2/d in Chabahar city, technical analysis of this system demonstrates that this city has a high capacity to producing the electrical energy via PV-diesel hybrid system with total electrical production amount of 10,575 kWh/yr from PV (8,447 kWh/yr) and Diesel system (2,128 kWh/yr). For do this work at the first, the required data is gathered from the meteorological organization of Iran and then technical and economic analysis is conducted with the Homer software.

Virtual power plants are an efficient way to implement this engagement. In this paper, the detailed costs and benefits of implementing a realistic virtual power plant (VPP) in Western Australia, comprising 67 dwellings, are calculated. The VPP is designed to integrate and coordinate rooftop solar photovoltaic panels (PV), vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFB), heat pump hot water systems (HWSs), and demand management mechanisms. An 810-kW rooftop solar PV system is designed and located using the HelioScope software. The charging and the discharging of a 700-kWh VRFB are scheduled for everyday use over a year using an optimization algorithm, to maximize the benefit of it for the VPP owners and for the residents. The use of heat pump HWSs provides a unique opportunity for the residents to save energy and reduce the total cost of electricity along with demand management on some appliances. The cost-and-benefit analysis shows that the cost of energy will be reduced by 24% per dwelling in the context of the VPP. Moreover, the internal rate of return for the VPP owner is at least 11% with a payback period of about 8.5 years, which is a promising financial outcome. © 2020 by the authors.

One of the SDGs (i.e., SDG7) suggests that it is necessary to ensure energy access for all. In developing countries like India, the progress toward SDG7 has somewhat stagnated. The aging conventional electric power system has its dominant share of energy from fossil fuels, plagued with frequent power outages, and leaves many un-electrified areas. These are not characteristics of a sustainable and modern system in the context of the SDG7. Promoting renewable-based energy systems, especially in the context of microgrids (MGs), is one of the promising advances needed to rejuvenate the progress toward the SDG7. In this context, a hybrid renewable energy microgrid (HREM) is proposed that gives assurance for energy access to all in an affordable, reliable, and sustainable way through modern energy systems. In this paper, a techno-economic and environmental modeling of the grid-independent HREM and its optimization for a remote community in South India are presented. A case of HREM with a proposed configuration of photovoltaic/wind turbine/diesel generator/battery energy storage system (PV/WT/DG/BESS) was modeled to meet the community residential electric load requirements. This investigation dealt with the optimum sizes of the different components used in the HREM. The results of this model presented numerous feasible solutions. Sensitivity analysis was conducted to identify the best solution from the four optimized results. From the results, it was established that a PV + DG + BESS based HREM was the most cost-effective configuration for the specific location. In addition, the obtained optimum solutions were mapped with the key criteria of the SDG7. This mapping also suggested that the PV + DG + BESS configuration falls within the context of the SDG7. Overall, it is understood that the proposed HREM would provide energy access to households that is affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern. © 2020 by the authors.","Community microgrid; Energy access to all; Environmental analysis; Hybrid renewable energy microgrid; Microgrid; SDG7; Techno-economic modeling","alternative energy; developing world; economic analysis; electrical power; fossil fuel; residential energy; Sustainable Development Goal; India","Manoj Kumar, N.; School of Energy and Environment, City University of Hong Kong, Discipline of Engineering and Energy, Murdoch UniversityHong Kong; email: mnallapan2-c@my.cityu.edu.hk",,"MDPI AG",20711050,,,,"English","Sustainability",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85086178577

For those regions, the enormous available potential of renewable energy resources is believed to be useful for the development of a stand-alone power supply system. This paper presents the modeling of a stand-alone hybrid system for the remote area of Ethiopia. A comparison of the economic performance of various scenarios of a stand-alone photovoltaic (PV)-wind hybrid system, with battery storage and diesel as a backup for electrifying remote rural areas, is presented. Therefore, a practical example, Kutur village of Awlio kebele of the Axum district, Ethiopia (which is 30 km away from the closest national grid) is considered for this research. Two electric load scenarios are estimated by considering the set of incandescent and efficient lamps for lighting for the 120 existing households. The above-mentioned solar radiation and wind speed are then used as an input to simulate the hybrid set-up for the high and low load estimation using HOMER software. The simulation result shows that the net present costs (NPC) corresponding to the high and low load scenarios is $262,470 and $180,731, respectively. Besides, an essential load forecasting is performed to see the effect of the increase in electric demand of the community on the required investment to install a stand-alone hybrid set-up. The NPC after load forecasting is found to be more than three folds of the NPC required for the reference year. In both cases, the simulation results indicate that using a stand-alone PV-wind hybrid system with battery storage and a diesel generator as a backup for electrifying Kutur village is cost-effective and comparable against the cost required for electrifying the village by extending the grid. © 2020 by the authors.","Battery storage; Diesel generator; Grid access; HOMER; Hybrid PV-wind","alternative energy; cost analysis; diesel engine; economic analysis; energy storage; estimation method; investment; photovoltaic system; rural area; smart grid; solar radiation; wind velocity; Aksum; Ethiopia","Padmanaban, S.; Center for Bio-Energy and Green Engineering, Department of Energy Technology, Aalborg University, Niels Bohrs Vej 8, Denmark; email: san@et.aau.dk",,"MDPI AG",20711050,,,,"English","Sustainability",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85085353645

Many government policies are deployed in Taiwan to promote solar and wind energy to cope with air pollution and self-dependency for energy generation. However, the residential sector contribution is not significant despite higher feed-in tariff rates set by government. This study analyzes wind and solar power availability of four different locations of southern Taiwan, based on the Köppen-Geiger climate classification system. The solar-wind hybrid system (SWHS) considered in this study consists of multi-crystalline photovoltaic (PV) modules, vertical wind turbines, inverters and batteries. Global reanalysis weather data and a climate-based electricity load profile at a 1-h resolution was used for the simulation. A general framework for multi-objective optimization using this simulation technique is proposed for solar-wind hybrid system, considering the feed-in tariff regulations, environmental regulations and installation area constraints of Taiwan. The hourly load profile is selected using a climate classification system. A decomposition-based differential evolutionary algorithm is used for finding the optimal Pareto set of two economic objectives and one environmental objective with maximum installation area and maximum PV capacity constraints. Two types of buildings are chosen for analysis at four climate locations. Analysis of Pareto sets revealed that the photovoltaic modules are economic options for a gridconnected mode at all four locations, whereas solar-wind hybrid systems are more environmentally friendly. A method of finding the fitness index for the Pareto front sets and a balanced strategy for choosing the optimal configuration is proposed. The proposed balanced strategy provides savings to users-up to 49% for urban residential buildings and up to 32% for rural residential buildings with respect to buildings without a hybrid energy system (HES)-while keeping carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions lower than 50% for the total project lifecycle time of 20 years. The case study reveals that for all four locations and two building types an HES system comprising a 15 kW photovoltaic system and a small capacity battery bank provides the optimal balance between economic and environmental objectives. © 2020 by the authors.

Some countries utilize net-metering strategies, which use national networks as ""virtual batteries."" Despite the financial attractiveness, net-metering faces many technological and economical challenges. It could also lead to the negative tendencies in prosumer behavior, such as a decrease in motivation for the self-consumption of photovoltaic (PV)-generated electricity. Batteries, which are installed on the prosumer's premises, could be a solution in a particular case. However, the price for batterybased storage solutions is currently sufficiently unattractive for the average prosumer. This paper aimed to present a comparison of the economic and energy related aspects between net-metering and batteries for a single case study by considering the Lithuanian context. The net present value, degree of self-sufficiency, internal rate of return, payback time, and quantified reduction of carbon emission were calculated using a specially developed Prosumer solution simulation tool (Version 1.1, Delloite, Madrid, Spain) for both the PV and net-metering and PV and batteries cases. The received results highlight that the battery-based energy storage systems are currently not an attractive alternative in terms of price where net-metering is available; a rather radical decrease in the installation price for batteries is required. © 2020 by the author.","Batteries; Net-metering; Photovoltaics","Earnings; Electric energy storage; Photovoltaic effects; Carbon emissions; Electricity storages; Energy storage systems; Internal rate of return; Net present value; Photovoltaic installation; Residential building; Storage solutions; Electric batteries","Milčius, D.; Lithuanian Energy InstituteLithuania; email: darius.milcius@lei.lt",,"MDPI AG",19961073,,,,"English","Energies",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85084329553

Due to their small size, however, microgrids may have financial limitations which preclude them from using commercial software to optimize control of their assets. Open-source optimization solvers are a viable alternative, but increase computation time. This work expands on a rolling horizon optimization framework for economic dispatch within an existing residential microgrid located in Hoover, Alabama. The microgrid has an open-source solver requirement and a need for quick solution time on a rolling horizon as opposed to a day-ahead commitment. We present a method of reducing integer variables by relaxation which completes two goals: reduction in computation time for real-time operations, and reduction in daily operational cost for the microgrid. Seasonal data for load and photovoltaic (PV) power was also collected from the microgrid to facilitate simulation testing. Computation time was successfully reduced using multiple variations of the relaxation method, while obtaining solution quality with operational cost similar to or better than the original model. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Energy management system; Microgrids; Mixed-integer programming; Rolling horizon","Cost reduction; Electric load dispatching; Energy management; Integer programming; Microgrids; Open source software; Photovoltaic cells; Scheduling; Commercial software; Computational burden; Mixed integer programming; Real-time operation; Renewable technology; Residential microgrid; Rolling horizon; Rolling horizon optimization; Energy management systems",,,"Elsevier Ltd",03608352,,CINDD,,"English","Comput Ind Eng",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85081676779

However, this has proved difficult because consumers are engaged in pursuing everyday practices rather than focusing on abstract questions of energy. Recent studies have suggested that being a prosumer can make a difference. This paper builds on survey data from a representative sample of 2505 photovoltaic (PV) owners in Denmark combined with 12 qualitative in-depth interviews. The results indicate that PV owners consider that they have become more concerned about energy consumption and adjust the timing of their everyday practices to their production. Thus, 67% of the households 'often' or 'always' time-shift the use of washing machines to their production. The extent to which households time-shift is strongly related to their net-metering scheme. Thus, 75% of the households on hourlymetering stated that they 'to some' or to 'a great extent' adjust their consumption, compared to only 26% of the households on annual metering. This financial effect is interpreted in an everyday life context where financial gain transfers meanings of self-sufficiency and sustainability, rather than primarily being viewed as rational economic behaviour. The conclusion discusses the policy implications of methods to engage the consumer. © 2020 by the authors.","Demand-side management; Energy prosumers; Household practices; Load management; Renewable energy production; Residential electricity consumption","data interpretation; economic analysis; instrumentation; photovoltaic system; policy making; questionnaire survey; self sufficiency; sustainability; Denmark","Gram-Hanssen, K.; Department of the Built Environment, Aalborg University CopenhagenDenmark; email: kgh@build.aau.dk",,"MDPI AG",20711050,,,,"English","Sustainability",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85085685241

Apart from the attractive environmental benefits, a relevant uncertainty concerns the economic convenience of such a choice. Since many variables play a role, we set up a total cost of ownership model to evaluate whether, and under which conditions, the bundle is cost-competitive relative to buying an electric car only (and charging it from the electrical grid) or a conventional combustion engine car. By combining, for the first time, such an economic model with an energy model and a driving profile model, we find that the degree of electricity self-production used to charge the electric car might be very high, varying from 90% to 62%, depending on the annual distance traveled. The cost of such electricity varies widely and can be lower than the grid electricity price when fiscal incentives are available and for long annual distances traveled. A smart charging practice based on both economic factors and weather forecast can greatly enhance self-sufficiency, i.e., independence from the electrical grid. We estimate that, given the current Italian financial incentives, 10,000 km/year are needed to make the electric car cost-competitive with respect to an equivalent petrol-fueled one. Such threshold increases to more than 25,000 km/year if financial incentives are removed. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

ZEHs with wide implementation of HEMS are expected to provide energy and cost-saving chances and are playing more as prosumers under collaboratively designed power-pricing schemes. This research focused on investigating the techno-economic performance of real ZEH applications in Japan. Firstly, we introduced the current technological innovations and coordinated smart management strategies to optimize the cost or energy-saving performance of the ZEHs. Then, we illustrated the operational performances of four typical ZEHs focused on the power of self-sufficiency and dynamic power balance. Meanwhile, we examined the role of HEMS in managing integrated on-site generators based on how they operated according to historical data. Results indicated that day-ahead prediction helped enhance the matching scenario between daily thermal consumption and preproduction of heat pumps, fuel cells could respond effectively to changes in simultaneous electricity and heating loads, and cogeneration systems could enhance the local electricity self-sufficiency ratio and reduce net load fluctuations, especially under high heating demand periods. We also concluded that efficient performance of ZEHs is not just a matter of advanced technologies but is also highly dependent on real-time demand-side management and local load-matching scenarios. Finally, we analyzed and compared the impacts of integrated on-site generators among ZEHs on improving economic and environmental performance from an overall energy system. The analysis indicated that PV contributed to a significant ratio of annual ZEH's economic profit.

However, little attention has been paid to buildings located in rural areas. The aim of this study is to assess the energy performance of two-story residential buildings located in the mountainous village of Palangan in Iran and to evaluate the impact of multiple parameters, namely building orientation, window-to-wall ratio (WWR), glazing type, shading devices, and insulation, on its energy performance. To attain a nearly zero energy building design in rural areas, the building is equipped with photovoltaic modules. The proposed building design is then economically evaluated to ensure its viability. The findings indicate that an energy saving of 29% can be achieved compared to conventional buildings, and over 22 MWh of electricity can be produced on an annual basis. The payback period is assessed at 21.7 years. However, energy subsidies are projected to be eliminated in the near future, which in turn may reduce the payback period. © 2020 by the authors.

To do this, the two most widely adopted photovoltaic (PV) simulation packages in the market, namely PVsyst® and HOMER Energy® were used. The different origins, data timespan, space and time resolution, of the five most relevant solar irradiation databases available for the region were compared. A case study was presented to illustrate the influences of the solar irradiation database and the solar simulation tool on the resulting PV generator. Furthermore, the hourly behavior of the energy supply to an existing load in a minigrid in the Brazilian Amazon was evaluated, together with the savings in diesel obtained with the resulting PV generator. Evaluating the five options of solar radiation databases, for the same PV plant configuration, variations of up to 19.7% were found in the expectation of PV generation. When the simulation software package was varied, the combined effect (radiation database X PV system sizing tool) showed differences of up to 20.6%. This demonstrates that despite having different algorithms, computational tools have a small influence (less than 1%) on results. These combined differences, taking into account the load curve behavior and the total diesel generation capacity installed at the site, resulted in over 100% differences in the optimum PV generator size in the case study. The total savings in diesel fuel, over a 15-years period, ranged from $ 6.5 million to over $ 16 million (>2.5 times) for the smallest PV system. This demonstrates the importance of the correct choice of database. These evaluations can be extended to minigrids of any size elsewhere. The novelty and originality of this study is to demonstrate and quantify for the first time the influence of the solar radiation database and the PV simulator package on the sizing of PV-diesel generators.

However, effectiveness and usefulness of storage may vary under different circumstances. This study provides an abstract perspective on the merits of electrical energy storage integrated with decentralized supply systems consisting of solar PV and wind power in a meso-level, residential sector context. We used a balancing model to couple demand and supply patterns based on Dutch weather data and assess the resultant loads given various scenarios. Our model results highlight differences in storage effectiveness for solar PV and wind power, and strong diminishing-returns effects. Small storage capacities can be functional in reducing surpluses in overdimensioned supply systems and shortages in underdimensioned supply systems. However, full elimination of imbalance requires substantial storage capacities. The overall potential of storage to mitigate imbalance of variable renewable energy is limited. Integration of storage in local supply systems may have self-sufficiency and cost-effectiveness benefits for prosumers but may have additional peak load disadvantages for grid operators. Adequate policy measures beyond current curtailment strategies are required to ensure proper distribution of benefits and responsibilities associated with variable renewable energy and storage. © 2019","Decentralization; Electricity storage; Model analysis; Renewable energy; vRES","Cost effectiveness; Electric energy storage; Wind power; Decentralization; Electricity storages; Model analysis; Renewable energies; vRES; Digital storage; alternative energy; decentralization; economic growth; energy storage; model; smart grid; solar power; wind power; Netherlands","Laugs, G.A.H.; Centre for Energy and Environmental Sciences, University of Gro.ningen, Nijenborgh 6, Netherlands; email: g.a.h.laugs@rug.nl",,"Elsevier Ltd",03014215,,ENPYA,,"English","Energy Policy",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85079616741

Significant amount of energy is consumed by the residential sector, highlighting the importance of developing sustainable energy technologies for this sector. In the current study, the behavior of an earth - air heat exchanger is simulated numerically, and the results are validated against the existing experimental data. To improve reliability and sustainability, the heat exchanger is coupled with a hybrid renewable energy system, including wind, solar and hydrogen. The performance of this system is explored in continuous and intermittent modes over a period of one month. The results show that nearly half of the drop in total performance of the system occurs during the first working day. Further, running the system intermittently result in an 8% rise in the effectiveness and around 31.55 MJ energy delivery over the period of a month. This implies that the long-term behavior of the system can be determined by monitoring its behavior on the first day of operation. It is also demonstrated that adding geothermal energy to hybrid renewable energy system can lead to an improvement of about 5.5% of the renewable fraction, decrease emissions and diesel consumption by almost 48%. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Earth-air heat exchanger (EAHE); Geothermal energy; Hybrid renewable energy system (HRES); Renewable energy; Thermal soil saturation","Greenhouse gases; Heat exchangers; Solar power generation; Earth-air heat exchangers; Earthair heat exchanger (EAHE); Hybrid Renewable Energy System (HRES); Hybrid renewable energy systems; Renewable energies; Soil saturation; Sustainable energy technology; Techno-economic assessment; Geothermal energy; alternative energy; fuel consumption; geothermal energy; heat transfer; hydrogen; optimization; performance assessment; photovoltaic system; saturated medium; technological development","Akhtari, M.R.; Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Shiraz University of TechnologyIran; email: MR.Akhtari@sutech.ac.ir",,"Elsevier Ltd",09601481,,,,"English","Renew.

Like most economic sectors, sanitation systems can benefit from the use of these renewable energy hybrid systems for the expansion of their activities. In this research topic, a renewable energy hybrid system is designed to supply energy to a pumping station in the city of Santa Rosa, RS, Brazil. For this aim, three cases are proposed and simulated in the software HOMER to obtain the optimal solution with the lower cost: a) wind-photovoltaic-diesel connected to the grid; b) wind-photovoltaic-diesel isolated; and c) wind-photovoltaic iso-lated. All three hybrid systems are viable and can supply energy for the pumping station, but their costs are still high. Govern-ment incentive programs, development of new technologies and penalties for the emission of pollutant gases can make these re-newable energy hybrid systems become even more competitive. A consumption of 1.5 kW for pumping of sewage, according to the results obtained, can be attended with three combinations: a grid-connected diesel photovoltaic system, an isolated diesel photovoltaic wind system and an isolated photovoltaic wind system. These systems would have a total net present cost of US$ 47,867, US$ 85,381 and US$ 118,753, respectively, with energy costs equal to US $ 0.291 per kWh, US $ 0.581 per kWh and US $ 0.721 per kWh respectively.

This paper proposes a solution for sustainable residential heating in regions experiencing moderate Winters. The solution integrates the effects of intelligent design and operation. It encompasses minimization of thermal inadequacy, renewable energy incorporation, and optimal policy for the heating controls. Through a case study for an apartment in Jordan, the merits of the proposed solution are highlighted in terms of performance, feasibility, and environmental-friendliness using a detailed physical model. It was found out that thermal inadequacy could double both electricity consumption and generated CO2. Additionally, despite having global warming potential for their working fluids, utilization of heat pumps instead of electric heaters can reduce CO2 emissions by 75 % with a payback period as short as 15 heating months. Finally, various heating schemes are examined. A proposed policy which represents a hybrid control technique merging threshold controller with demand-based zone heating was found to be capable of handling the trinary trade off resulting from thermal comfort, cost reduction, and minimum number of heating system starts. An optimal set of lower and upper bounds for active and inactive periods were found. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Intelligent system; Residential heating; Solar PV; Sustainability; Thermal adequacy","Carbon dioxide; Cost reduction; Economic and social effects; Global warming; Heating equipment; Housing; Intelligent systems; Investments; Sustainable development; Electricity-consumption; Environmental friendliness; Global warming potential; Lower and upper bounds; Residential heating; Residential sectors; Solar PVs; Thermal adequacy; Heating","Almuhtady, A.; Mechanical & Maintenance Eng.

Although the Myanmar government has set a target of 100% electrification by 2030, less than half of the households are currently connected to the national grid. To expedite electrification, decentralized approaches should be considered. Mini-grids are an effective alternative that can fill the gap between a solar home system and the national grid; however, many of the existing mini-grids in Myanmar are powered by diesel generators. Diesel fuel is significantly more expensive in rural areas than in urban areas due to high transportation costs. Although mini-grids powered by solar photovoltaics and batteries are cost-competitive with diesel generators, the deployment of renewable energy-based mini-grids is slow. In this study, we analyzed the barriers to mini-grid deployment and prioritized the barriers. We conducted a questionnaire survey with stakeholders using the analytic hierarchy process to identify the prioritization of each barrier factor. The K-means clustering method was used to determine tendencies and showed that there was no single, dominant solution.

In this study, several alternative policy options were assessed on the financial case for private homeowners investing in a PV system (simple payback time), on purchasing behaviour (using a technology adoption model), and on governmental costs. While continuation of net metering policy leads to ongoing improvement of the financial case up to levels that could be considered overstimulation, three policy alternatives can be set up so that they stabilise simple payback times of recent and future generations of PV systems. Under these alternative instruments, deployment of PV systems in this market segment is indicatively estimated to be 15–20% lower by the year 2030 than with continuation of net metering policy, while corresponding governmental cost reduction indications would be more than 50%.

In the U.S. growing interest in rooftop residential solar among city managers has spurred the development of photovoltaic (PV) feasibility maps of the technical and economic solar potential within cities. The City of Brownsville, Texas was interested in evaluating solar feasibility for their city but lacked information to make informed policy decisions on PV development. This paper presents novel and systems approaches for determining the technical and economic feasibility of solar development for homes in the Brownsville using LiDAR and local information. Residential technical and economic potential was assessed by optimizing the internal rate of return (IRR) and an average residential building demand profile to determine ideal size and placement of solar arrays. Results showed that residential structures in Brownsville have the technical potential to generate approximately 11% of the total energy provided by the local utility; however, average IRR was only 2.9% with a payback period of over 15 years. Five neighborhoods in the City of Brownsville were identified with spatially clustered homes that had relatively higher IRRs compared with other areas in the city. Despite the high technical potential, modeled results indicate that perspective home owners interested in solar development may require additional incentives to improve the economic feasibility of PV in Brownsville. This study provides a demonstration of an interdisciplinary systems approach and methodology that can be adopted internationally to evaluate the feasibility of solar development in other areas. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Geographic information systems; Internal rate of return; LiDAR; Photovoltaic economic potential; Residential rooftop photovoltaics; Systems-thinking","Earnings; Geographic information systems; Housing; Information use; Investments; Optical radar; Solar cell arrays; Solar energy; Economic feasibilities; Economic potentials; Interdisciplinary systems; Internal rate of return; Photovoltaics; Residential structures; Systems thinking; Technical assessment; Solar power generation; energy efficiency; GIS; lidar; numerical model; photovoltaic system; satellite data; satellite imagery; solar power; Brownsville; Texas; United States","Mangiante, M.J.; Environmental Resource Management, 1776 I Street, N.W., Suite 725, United States; email: michael.mangiante@erm.com",,"Elsevier Ltd",01989715,,CEUSD,,"English","Comput.

With a high penetration of DERs on primary circuits (feeders), utility substation communication, automation, and control must adopt to this new paradigm. In principle, utility substations can transition to and operate the feeder circuits in an islanded mode, effectively as Distribution Feeder Microgrids. This creates the need for research to address the challenges associated with integrating and managing significant deployment of DERs on circuits served by distribution substations. In response, this study addresses substation control to manage circuits emanating from utility substations as a microgrid. To this end, a model for substation automatic control using a Generic Microgrid Controller compliant with the IEEE 2030.7 standard was developed, and the role and impact of substation control to improve energy management, increase renewable penetration, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions were evaluated. The detailed digital simulation model developed encompassed two 12 kV distribution circuits emanating from a utility distribution substation. Individual homes were modeled and results verified using field data collected from a previous study. Various scenarios were simulated in order to determine PV hosting capability of the circuits equipped with a controller at the substation and with three energy storage configurations: (1) A residential energy storage unit (RESU) where all customers own a battery energy storage behind the meter, (2) a community energy storage (CES) unit where a utility-owned battery energy storage is deployed near each transformer, and (3) a circuit battery where a relatively large battery is deployed at the substation serving the entire feeder microgrid. Results show that substation automation and control can increase renewable penetration and reduce emissions without any necessary upgrades to the grid infrastructure. Moreover, the CES configuration was found to be a more economic approach for achieving high PV penetration and GHG reduction than residential storage, achieving a 660 mTCO2eq reduction per MWh of installed energy storage and overall 32% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Controller; Distributed energy resources; Distribution management; Feeder microgrid; GHG reduction; Substation automation","Automation; Controllers; Digital storage; Electric batteries; Electric network analysis; Electric substations; Energy resources; Feeding; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Housing; Distributed Energy Resources; Distribution management; GHG reductions; Micro grid; Substation automation; Battery storage; automation; energy storage; greenhouse gas; photovoltaic system; power plant; reduction; residential energy","Razeghi, G.; Advanced Power and Energy Program, University of CaliforniaUnited States; email: gr@apep.uci.edu",,"Elsevier Ltd",03062619,,APEND,,"English","Appl.

Studies focusing on building heating alternatives in subarctic climate are limited and hence, this work can help with the development of such systems in remote off-grid communities. Shallow geothermal potential was mapped for Kuujjuaq, the largest village in Nunavik. Four ground-coupled heat pump scenarios were analysed for a simulated 5-occupant residential dwelling, with heating needs of 71 MWh/year. Resulting maps show a relatively high ground potential for such cold region, ranging between 5.8 MWh/year and 22.9 MWh/year per borehole for heat exchanger lengths of 100 m–300 m. A 50-year life-cycle cost analysis of such systems reveal that a compression heat pump with electricity derived from solar photovoltaic panels has a net present cost as low as approximately CAD$179,000, representing the most economically attractive heating option in Kuujjuaq as compared to the currently subsidized, diesel furnace heating at CAD$277,000. This work verifies that shallow geothermal energy through state-of-the-art heat pumps is a financially interesting option in Kuujjuaq.

Hydrogen as an energy carrier and energy storage medium has gained enormous interest globally in recent years. Its use in stand-alone or off-grid microgrids for both the urban and rural communities has commenced recently in some locations. Therefore, this research evaluates the techno-economic feasibility of renewable energy-based systems using hydrogen as energy storage for a stand-alone/off-grid microgrid. Three case scenarios in a microgrid environment were identified and investigated in order to select an optimum solution for a remote community by considering the energy balance and techno-economic optimization. The ""HOMER Pro"" energy modelling and simulating software was used to compare the energy balance, economics and environmental impact amongst the proposed scenarios. The simulation results showed that the hydrogen-battery hybrid energy storage system is the most cost-effective scenario, though all developed scenarios are technically possible and economically comparable in the long run, while each has different merits and challenges. It has been shown that the proposed hybrid energy systems have significant potentialities in electrifying remote communities with low energy generation costs, as well as a contribution to the reduction of their carbon footprint and to ameliorating the energy crisis to achieve a sustainable future. © 2020 by the authors.

These studies evaluated either the social or economic impacts of solar photovoltaic (PV) technology adoption, often both, as a socio-economic analysis. A few other studies investigated the environmental impacts only. On the other hand, some studies considered the drivers and barriers of this technology adoption. However, studies considering all these factors – impacts, drivers, barriers – together to derive an overall picture of solar electricity deployment as a part of energy decentralization rarely occur in the literature. This study has taken into account this gap in the literature and tried to analyze all the factors together through the lens of the energy cultures framework (ECF) and provide insights into the interplay that exists between these factors. The ECF revealed that the drivers of SHS adoption are dominated by the ‘cognitive norms’ of the adopters. In contrast, the significant barriers belong to the ‘material culture’ of the people. This study further indicates the policy implications of energy decentralization. These findings might be a useful source of information for energy policymakers towards formulating a sustainable national electricity generation plan for developing economies to meet the United Nations sustainable development goals. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Developing economies; Drivers and barriers; Energy cultures framework; Impacts of SHS; Renewable energy decentralization; Solar home system (SHS)","Behavioral research; Economic analysis; Environmental impact; Public policy; Solar buildings; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Sustainable development; Developing economies; Energy cultures framework; Impacts of SHS; Renewable energies; Solar home system; Economic and social effects","Khan, I.; Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Jashore University of Science and Technology, Jashore, Bangladesh; email: ikr_ece@yahoo.com",,"Elsevier Ltd",13640321,,RSERF,,"English","Renewable Sustainable Energy Rev",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85075456684

This unsustainable development model makes the provision of services such as electricity a challenge. This research investigates the hybrid renewable mini-grid Baltra-Santa Cruz, which represents 62% of the electricity generation mix of the archipelago. This study aims to support the Galapagos Zero Fossil Fuel Initiative and the Sustainable Development Goal 7 through the reduction in diesel consumption and electricity generation costs. To do so, HOMER Pro, a specialized hybrid renewable mini-grid planning tool, is used to perform several techno-economic assessments, focusing on different electricity demand scenarios. Therefore, multiple pathways are compared to identify the most reliable alternatives towards the progressive decarbonization of this hybrid system. The results indicate that installing 18.25 MWp of photovoltaic and 20.68 MWh of battery capacity could reduce the Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE) from 32.06 to 18.95 USc/kWh, increasing the renewable energy (RE) share from 18% to 39%. Additionally, the successful application of energy efficiency measures would even reduce the LCOE to 17.10 USc/kWh. What is more, distributed energy is considered the most attractive way to involve islanders in the energy transition process.

Accordingly, it is essential to optimize the scheduling of ESS with PV to maximize economic and environmental benefits for residential buildings. Therefore, this study developed an optimal scheduling model of ESS with PV in residential buildings considering the economic and environmental aspects. The optimal scheduling model was developed in the following two steps: (i) definition of the variables; and (ii) development of the optimal scheduling model of ESS with PV. Despite the rule-based scheduling could only raise lifecycle environmental benefit by sacrificing economic benefit, the optimal scheduling could raise both lifecycle economic and environmental benefits increasing the net income and self-sufficiency rate by up to US$2.8 per month and 2.7%, compared to the case of applying the PV system without ESS. This study has significant contributions in facilitating the wide use of ESS with PV by not only improving its economic and environmental benefits for the ESS owner but also reducing the cost for constructing additional power plants for the government. © 2019","Economic and environmental analysis; Energy storage system; Epsilon-constraint method; Mixed-integer linear programming; Multi-objective optimization","Economic analysis; Energy storage; Environmental technology; Housing; Integer programming; Life cycle; Multiobjective optimization; Photovoltaic cells; Scheduling; Sustainable development; Economic and environmental benefits; Efficient technology; Energy storage systems; Environmental analysis; Environmental aspects; Environmental benefits; Epsilon-constraint method; Mixed integer linear programming; Economic and social effects","Hong, T.; Department of Architecture and Architectural Engineering, Yonsei UniversitySouth Korea; email: hong7@yonsei.ac.kr",,"Elsevier Ltd",03787788,,ENEBD,,"English","Energy Build.",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85076889267

Evaluating the mass deployment of DER at the national level would require analyzing millions of individual buildings, entailing significant computational burden. To overcome this, this work proposes a novel bottom-up model that consists of an aggregation algorithm to create a spatially distributed set of typical residential buildings from census data. Each typical building is then optimized with a Mixed-Integer Linear Program to derive its cost optimal technology adoption and operation, determining its changing grid load in future scenarios. The model is validated for Germany, with 200 typical buildings considered to sufficiently represent the diversity of the residential building stock. In a future scenario for 2050, photovoltaic and heat pumps are predicted to be the most economically and ecologically robust supply solutions for the different building types. Nevertheless, their electricity generation and demand temporally do not match, resulting in a doubling of the peak electricity grid load in the rural areas during the winter. The urban areas can compensate this with efficient co-generation units, which are not cost-efficient in the rural areas. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Aggregation; Building stock; Energy systems; Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP); Typical buildings; Zero Energy Buildings (ZEB)","Agglomeration; Energy resources; Housing; Integer programming; Population statistics; Rural areas; Building stocks; Distributed energy resource; Electricity generation; Energy systems; Mixed integer linear program; Mixed-integer linear programming; Residential building stocks; Zero energy building (ZEB); Zero energy buildings","Kotzur, L.; Institute of Techno-economic Systems Analysis (IEK-3), Forschungszentrum Jülich GmbH, Wilhelm-Johnen-Str., Germany; email: l.kotzur@fz-juelich.de",,"Elsevier Ltd",03787788,,ENEBD,,"English","Energy Build.",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85077088443

Optimal scheduling of local generation units can lead to economic improvement in RCs. In this regard, optimization of the performance of RCs appears to be necessary. Operators of RC energy systems equipped with local generation units can benefit from demand response programs (DRPs) to reduce their operating costs while satisfying energy demands. Within these programs, energy consumers are motivated to change their consumption in a way that economic targets are satisfied. In this paper, optimal operation of a grid-connected EV/PV RC energy system is studied under real-time pricing of a DRP. The studied RC energy system is equipped with PV units and EVs that can support RCs in supplying energy demands and providing economic benefits. The incorporated PV unit is modeled considering solar irradiance parameters and ambient temperature, which can lead to accurate simulation results. Moreover, the proposed model for EVs can enhance the efficient operation of RCs through optimal charge and discharge processes. Further, the optimal operation of energy systems integrated into RCs is modeled as mixed-integer linear programming (MILP). Additionally, a general algebraic modeling system (GAMS) is used to carry out simulations in different scenarios and the results are presented for comparison. For the studied test case, the total expected cost of RCs is reduced by 37.31%, which represents the influential impact of demand response on the optimal scheduling of DG units. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Economic performance; Electric vehicle (EV); Photovoltaic (PV) system; Real-time pricing (RTP) of demand response program (DRP); Residential complex (RC)","Cost reduction; Economic analysis; Electric automobiles; Electric discharges; Housing; Integer programming; Operating costs; Photovoltaic cells; Scheduling; Charge and discharge; Demand response programs; Economic improvements; Economic performance; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Mixed-integer linear programming; Photovoltaic systems; Residential complexes; Real time systems","Seyyedeh Barhagh, S.; Faculty of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of TabrizIran; email: sbarhagh95@ms.tabrizu.ac.ir",,"Elsevier Ltd",09596526,,JCROE,,"English","J.

At the same time, energy supply to the unprivileged population at the affordable cost is a major issue. Moreover, appropriate technology is the key factor for the sustainable operation of small-scale generation system in remote places. Therefore, in this paper, a simple controller-based standalone solar photovoltaic (PV) augmented micro-hydro generation system suitable for remote area has been proposed. Because of its robustness for wide speed range applications, doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) has been used for micro-hydro power generation in the proposed scheme. The developed controller effectively stabilizes the load voltage with load, micro-hydro generation, and solar PV generation variations. In order to provide cost-effective renewable power supply to the rural population, a generation capacity trade-off criterion has been developed considering solar PV and micro-hydro generations as the two operators. In the proposed trade-off process, cost analysis has been performed considering the salvage dumping cost (SDC) for solar PV. The proposed hybrid generation scheme has been simulated through HOMER Pro-3.2 for cost-benefit analysis. Also, a prototype hardware set-up for the proposed scheme has been developed and tested successfully.

Firstly, load for the residential building is calculated and accordingly optimum sizing of various constituents of the PV system is obtained using HOMER. Subsequently, the economic analysis for both configurations is performed in terms of cost of energy, net present cost, initial cost, and operating and maintenance cost. The simulation results of HOMER suggest that for grid-independent PV based power system, FC-SCESS configuration is better from the economic point of view. As HOMER's inability to perform detailed technical analysis, MATLAB/Simulink models of both configurations are built and comparative analysis is performed in terms of different technical aspects such as active power balance, DC link voltage (VDC) regulation etc. From MATLAB results, it is observed that FC-SCESS configuration performs better by regulating the VDC more effectively and thereby helps maintain the active power balance between various constituents of the power system.

The analysis is based mainly on net present values (NPV) and levelized costs of electricity (LCOE). The results show that battery size and its cost, and retail rate design have significant impacts on the returns, whereas buyback incentives for excess electricity have the lowest impact.

This study investigates why small wind turbines have largely been omitted from Kenyan mini-grids from both a techno-economic and diffusion theoretical perspective. A techno-economic model is used for backtesting the feasibility of a hybrid PV/wind system, and building upon theories of innovation and diffusion of technology a conceptual framework is developed and applied for assessing the state of the Kenyan mini-grid sector and categorizing identified barriers accordingly. The article thus suggest an interdisciplinary approach to investigating the potential role of small wind power in energy systems transitioning towards renewables.

A generator that used Methanol was added to the system to enable the designed model more reliable. The contribution of each source type was analyzed in detail in the analysis section of the paper. It showed that the contribution of the generator is insignificant as compared to the contribution of the solar panel in supplying the loads.

Both European and UK national policies suggest that efforts should be made to reduce carbon emissions and increase the share of renewable energy, an important element of which is encouraging generation, typically PV, in partnership with energy storage systems in the residential sector. The scale of the energy storage system is important, i.e. in individual properties or as a community resource. Many advantages of community energy storage (CES) over household energy storage (HES) have been identified, but the design and operation of CES has received significantly less attention. Most existing research has analysed CES at community level only, but the performance and impact on individual households has yet to be fully explored. In this study an agent-based model is proposed to investigate and analyse CES based on a range of criteria. Results indicate that both HES and CES can significantly reduce the grid peak power import and export, improve the community self-consumption rate (SCR) and self-sufficiency rate (SSR), and contribute to much higher energy saving. Furthermore, optimising the CES capacity leads to more effective use of PV power and better demand localisation during high PV-generation periods. It is found that an important challenge for CES systems is to realise the value of the shared electricity equitably amongst the participants and potentially to seek other revenue streams. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Agent-based modelling; Battery management; Community energy storage; Distributed generation; Photovoltaics; Self-consumption","Autonomous agents; Battery management systems; Computational methods; Distributed power generation; Energy conservation; Heating; Housing; Photovoltaic cells; Renewable energy resources; Simulation platform; Agent-based modelling; Battery Management; Community energy; Photovoltaics; Self-consumption; Electric energy storage",,,"Elsevier Ltd",01968904,,ECMAD,,"English","Energy Convers.

As a result, deployment of residential solar PV cost is increased given the high-power consumption and becomes less viable. Utilities are also increasingly applying surcharges to customers with solar PV installations because of direct impacts to the grid, making purely solar PV installations unattractive. This is especially in the case for low-income households, where they are seemingly shut out from participating in the energy economy given the penalties and the costs. This research primary focus is to make Installed Cost Benchmarks for Residential Solar Photovoltaic with Energy Storage costs more affordable for an average-income home owner in the USA; one approach is to reduce power consumption within the household by adapting DC appliances. So, a compelling means towards reducing household load is to convert a portion of household electrical loads such as LED lighting, air conditioning, ceiling fans, and electronic loads to DC. Secondly, optimizing size of solar panels and battery and without the need for energy export, it compensates for surcharges and recover return on solar investment. Data provided in this paper gives an insight into adapting suitable hybrid DC/AC architecture for three different types of households associated with five different geographical regions based of different climactic conditions spread across the USA. The systems are distinguished by the degree to which redundant AC to DC conversion stages are reduced, which will be inversely proportional to cost. This paper shows that deployment of DC distribution within the house will result in lower average cost and better returns on solar and battery investment than revealed by the NREL study. Also, outlines the costs and savings of different architecture that can be adaptable based on the type of the house, location, savings, and affordability.

The renewable energy resources namely solar photovoltaic, wind turbine and bio generators are considered as the main sources because of its high potential in Korkadu district. This paper estimates the load forecasting for the selected district, which is a mixture of different load patterns namely residential, commercial, institutional and agricultural demands. The desired HRES has to meet the forecasted load demand for reliable electrification. The optimum design and techno-economic analysis of proposed HRES system is carried using powerful tool HOMER. This study also compares HRES's operational behavior with different operational strategies such as load following strategy, cycle charging strategy and combined strategy of the system. The outcome of the proposed dispatched strategy expressed the contribution of solar power as 86.8%, wind as 12.7% and bio gen power as 0.5% to meet out developed rural load pattern with 6.8% of battery bank losses and 1.78% of converter losses.

There are growing claims about economic and non-monetary factors driving the (non-)adoption of solar PV, but quantitative evidence about potential adopters is rather limited. Our study addresses this gap and investigates subsidy effects and non-economic variables affecting the likelihood to adopt solar PV. It deploys a survey experiment using a web panel of Swedish house owners (N = 208). A set of logistic regression models and corresponding statistical tests are used to examine several hypotheses. Results show that subsidies and peer effects are significant factors driving the likelihood to adopt. Contrary to indications in the literature, the visibility of technology (and related pro-social behaviour) is not significant and interaction effects among analysed factors are irrelevant. Results are statistically robust when controlling for other variables (e.g. age, income) and highlight that environmental awareness plays a positive role. Peer effects mostly come from hearing, but if the source is known both seeing and hearing affect the likelihood to adopt. Our results underline the importance of economic incentives and peer effects in decision-making process.

However, evaluating these hybrid systems has proved to be a major challenge, since their techno-economic performance depends on a large number of parameters, including the renewable energy generation profile, operational parameters of storage technologies and their associated costs. In this study, we develop a method to simulate the performance and determine the levelized cost of hybrid systems to provide firm electricity supply under various supply strategies such as peak demand and baseload at three different scales (representative sizes). The methodology is implemented for Switzerland, however, it can also be replicated for other geographies. Our results show that the optimal choice for a hybrid system depends on the scale rather than the supply mode strategy. We find that solar photovoltaics in combination with lithium-ion battery at the residential (0.39 to 0.77 EUR/kWh) and utility scale (0.17 to 0.36 EUR/kWh) as well as with pumped hydro storage at the bulk scale (0.13 to 0.18 EUR/kWh) offer the lowest levelized costs.

In particular, three different sizes for the residential communities are considered depending on the number of housing units: small, medium, and large. First, the best cost-effective energy efficiency measures (EEMs) have been determined and applied to all the buildings of the communities, in order to reduce their overall energy demand. The retrofit optimization results demonstrate that combinations of passive and active strategies would achieve source energy use saving and electrical peak demand savings up to 57% and 29%, respectively. Then, a variety of renewable energy generation systems has been explored to determine the optimal grid-connected technologies for meeting the electricity demands while achieving annual carbon neutral conditions for the residential buildings. The analysis shows that wind turbines can reduce the cost of electricity generation up to 21.5% compared to the current utility prices (LCOE value as 0.247 €/kWh) and electricity sell back policies. The results indicate that for PV systems to compete with wind turbines, their capital costs need to be lower by at least 40% compared to the current level costs. © 2019","Carbon Neutral; Energy Retrofit; Optimization; Residential Communities; Spain","Carbon; Cost benefit analysis; Cost effectiveness; Cost reduction; Energy utilization; Housing; Optimization; Renewable energy resources; Retrofitting; Wind turbines; Carbon neutrals; Cost of electricity; Electricity demands; Energy retrofit; Renewable energy generation; Residential building; Residential communities; Spain; Energy efficiency","Krarti, M.; University of ColoradoUnited States; email: krarti@colorado.edu",,"Elsevier Ltd",03787788,,ENEBD,,"English","Energy Build.",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85075971434

The methodology is applied to a case study of a residential building in Spain. First, the single-objective solutions are obtained, highlighting their fundamental differences regarding the installation of cogeneration (included in the optimal total annual cost solution) and solar-based technologies (included in the optimal total annual CO2 emissions solution). Then, the Pareto curve is generated, and a decision-making approach is proposed to select the preferred trade-off solutions based on the marginal cost of CO2 emissions saved. Additionally, sensitivity analyses are performed to investigate the influence of key parameters concerning energy resources prices, investment costs, and rooftop area. The analyses of the trade-off solutions verify the enormous potential for CO2 emissions reduction, which can reach 32.3% with only 1.1% higher costs by displacing cogeneration in favor of the heat pump and the electric grid.

We analyse the effects of different policy measures and revenue stacking on the economics of residential electricity storage in the UK. We identify six policy interventions through industry interviews and quantify their impact using a techno-economic model of a 4 kWh battery paired with a 4 kW solar system. Without policy intervention, residential batteries are not currently financially viable in the UK. Policies that enable access to multiple revenue streams, rather than just maximising PV self-consumption, improve this proposition. Demand Load-Shifting and Peak Shaving respectively increase the net present value per unit of investment cost (NPV/Capex) by 30 and 9 percentage points respectively. Given projected reductions in storage costs, stacking these services brings forward the break-even date for residential batteries by 9 years to 2024, and increases the effectiveness of policies that reduce upfront costs, suggesting that current policy is correctly focused on enabling revenue stacking. However, additional support is needed to accelerate deployment in the near term.

Promising solutions for minimizing grid injection are the combination of photovoltaic generation with electricity energy storage and load management, the latter commonly known as Demand Side Management. These strategies together with incentives for self-consumption or energy independence from the network will allow facilitating the integration of the always-increasing generation of renewable energy. In Europe, the usage of residential energy grid-interactive energy storage systems for buffering of surplus photovoltaic generation is becoming a field of growing interest and market activity, as a consequence of the less attractive photovoltaic feed-in-tariffs in the near future and incentives to promote self-consumption. This study aims to evaluate the energy exchange with the grid and the rate of self-consumption of combined photovoltaic–electricity energy storage systems dedicated to residential and small commercial prosumers. More specifically, several combinations of sizes of photovoltaic plant, annual household consumptions and electricity energy storage capacity were evaluated. This analysis aims to identify which arrangement among photovoltaic power, electricity consumption and battery capacity allows reaching the highest ratio of self-sufficiency and consequently minimizing the energy exchanged with the grid.

Reactive power control of PV inverter and active power control of energy storage system (ESS) are the effective voltage control methods for low-voltage distribution network (LVDN). Aiming at the limited communication conditions of LVDN and the insufficient research on coordination of reactive power of inverter and active power of ESS, a two-stage distributed control strategy based on consensus algorithm for PV inverter and ESS is proposed in this paper. Firstly, through the control effect-cost coefficient to analyze the effect and economy of adjustment for the equipment, a voltage control architecture is proposed in which the reactive power of inverter is first adjusted and then the active power of ESS is adjusted. Then, at the inverter control stage, the utilization ratio of reactive power is used as the consensus variable to ensure that the voltage regulation task is shared according to the inverter capacity. In the ESS control stage, the state of charge (SOC) of ESS is taken as the consensus variable, which not only considers the ESS capacity but also realizes the simultaneous control of ESS power and SOC. The simulation results demonstrate that voltage violations can be effectively mitigated, and voltage control cost can also be reduced. At the same time, the selection range of the control strategy parameters is given. © 2020 Automation of Electric Power Systems Press.","Consensus algorithm; Distributed control; Energy storage system (ESS); Low-voltage distribution network (LVDN); Photovoltaic (PV) inverter; Voltage violation","Closed loop control systems; Data storage equipment; Distributed parameter control systems; Electric inverters; Energy storage; Genetic algorithms; Housing; Reactive power; Voltage control; Voltage distribution measurement; Voltage regulators; Consensus algorithms; Distributed control; Energy storage systems; Low voltage distribution network; Photovoltaic inverters; Voltage violation; Power control","Tang, W.; College of Information and Electrical Engineering, China Agricultural UniversityChina; email: wei_tang@cau.edu.cn",,"Automation of Electric Power Systems Press",10001026,,DXZIE,,"Chinese","Dianli Xitong Zidonghue",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85080095602

This paper aims to analyze the techno-economic and environmental feasibility of a solar PV microgrid system which is able to supply the load during both grid availability and outage periods. A household in Baghdad was selected as a case study. HOMER software was used to carry out the overall analysis using five different control strategies. The results indicated that the most economical configuration was achieved by allowing the grid to charge the batteries at all rates, with a net present cost (NPC) of $29,713. A sustainability assessment revealed that preventing the grid from charging the battery resulted in the highest renewable fraction and the lowest CO2 emissions with 64.9% and 4533 kg/year, respectively. Furthermore, inserting a diesel generator to an economically optimized system was found to reduce the NPC by 11.6%, while increasing the CO2 emissions by 32.7%. This study showed that implementing this sort of project can provide clean, economical, and continuous electricity production in countries with daily blackouts. © 2019","Grid outages; HOMER; On/off-grid inverter; Optimization; PV","Carbon dioxide; Electric power generation; Optimization; Secondary batteries; Solar energy; Sustainable development; Electricity generation; Electricity production; Environmental feasibility; Grid connected PV system; Grid outage; HOMER; On/off-grid inverter; Sustainability assessment; Outages; diesel engine; electricity generation; energy planning; feasibility study; operations technology; photovoltaic system; power plant; residential energy; software; solar power; Baghdad [Iraq]; Iraq","Tajuddin, M.F.N.; School of Electrical Systems Engineering, Universiti Malaysia Perlis, Arau, Malaysia; email: faridun@unimap.edu.my",,"Elsevier Ltd",03605442,,ENEYD,,"English","Energy",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85076228841

In our work, a real options valuation (ROV) framework is proposed to determine the optimal strategy for executing multiple interacting options within a distribution network investment, to mitigate the risk of financial losses in the presence of future uncertainties. To demonstrate the characteristics of the proposed framework, we determine the optimal strategy to economically justify the investment in residential PV-battery systems for additional grid supply during peak demand periods. The options to defer, and then expand, are considered as multi-stage compound options, since the option to expand is a subsequent option of the former. These options are valued via the least squares Monte Carlo method, incorporating uncertainty over growing power demand, varying diesel fuel price, and the declining cost of PV-battery technology as random variables. Finally, a sensitivity analysis is performed to demonstrate how the proposed framework responds to uncertain events. The proposed framework shows that executing the interacting options at the optimal timing increases the investment value. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Battery energy storage; Compound options; Least square Monte Carlo; Real options valuation; Solar PV","Electric batteries; Electric energy storage; Housing; Least squares approximations; Losses; Monte Carlo methods; Optimal systems; Sensitivity analysis; Uncertainty analysis; Battery energy storage; Compound options; Least Square; Real options valuations; Solar PVs; Investments; electricity; energy market; equipment; investment; Monte Carlo analysis; photovoltaic system; sensitivity analysis; solar power; strategic approach; uncertainty analysis","Ma, Y.; School of Electrical and Information Engineering, The University of SydneyAustralia; email: yiju.ma@sydney.edu.au",,"Elsevier Ltd",03605442,,ENEYD,,"English","Energy",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85075893839

Meanwhile, solar Photovoltaic (PV) accounts for less than 2% of the energy mix (Energy Commission, 2018). In combating environmental issues such as climate change and meeting these policy targets, there is the urgent need to increase investment into the renewable sector. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to critically examine the impeding constraints to photovoltaic investment in Ghana. Design/methodology/approach: The Literature evaluation was carried out of critical constraints surrounding PV investments. Questionnaire was developed and administered online using Google form. Descriptive statistics was used to describe the features of each constraint. In addition, inferential analysis using relative importance index was used to rank these indicators. Again, one sample t-test was used to test the significance of the indicator. Multiple indicators were used to measure the latent constructs. Finally, independent test of mean equity was used to test relationship between the working experiences of despondence who have worked with solar PV below five years and those who worked from five years to ten years. Findings: The research has highlights high installation and maintenance costs, lack of access to long-term capital finance, access to affordable consumer finance and lack of support to research and development as the major investment obstacles to solar PV investment in Ghana. Research limitations/implications: It is recommended that the Government of Ghana should provide incentives such as tax waivers, which will encourage entrepreneurs, invest into PV. In addition, it is recommended that solar PV companies must collaborate with financial institutions to provide low interest and flexible consumer financing schemed that can enable home users to purchase the technology. Future research should complement this work by focusing on the impact of domestic currency volatility on PV investment. The scope of this study is constrained to the PV industry in Ghana. Practical implications: This study will serve as a guide to the private sector business owners to help make critical PV investment decisions. It has also brought to the forefront the reason why solar PV account for a small fraction of Ghana’s energy mix. Originality/value: This paper seeks to espouse the prevailing constraints to PV investment in Ghana and seeks to contribute to already existing literature that will make profound changes in state policy around PV investment. By understanding these difficulties, driving pointers can be recognized to encourage effective future venture inside the sustainable power source area. In this way, the research leads to a better understanding of the impeding factors that hinders PV investment in Ghana. Again, the paper has achieved new discovery with regards to variations between years of experience with PV use. The variation being less than five years with over five years of PV use. By understanding these difficulties, driving pointers can be recognized to invigorate effective future ventures. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Consumer financing; Decision-making; Energy sector; Entrepreneurs; Interviews; Photovoltaic; Renewable energies; Surveys","Climate change; Decision making; Economics; Energy policy; Solar concentrators; Solar power generation; Surveying; Surveys; Consumer financing; Energy sector; Entrepreneurs; Interviews; Photovoltaic; Renewable energies; Investments","Sackey, D.M.; Department of Mechanical Engineering, Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and TechnologyGhana; email: davidsackey.co.uk@gmail.com",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",17506220,,,,"English","Int.

This paper aims at analysing the techno-economic feasibility of hybrid renewable energy system (HRES) for sustainable rural electrification in Benin, using a case study of Fouay village. HOMER software is used to perform optimization, simulation and sensitivity analysis. The analysis showed that hybrid solar photovoltaics (PV)/diesel generator (DG)/battery (of 150 kW/62.5 kVA/637 kWh) is the least cost optimal system. This system ensures a reliable power supply, reduces battery requirements by 70% compared to PV/battery system and achieves 97% CO2 emissions reduction compared to a conventional DG. Moreover, the study demonstrated that the most economical HRES depends strongly on the potential energy sources available at a location and power plant's remoteness from the beneficiary.

The aim of this coordination is a high degree of self-sufficiency for the neighborhood while maintaining a high individual degree of self-sufficiency and relieving the grid. A financial incentive to increase the energy exchanged within the neighborhood is introduced. The local EM of the individual PV battery system uses model predictive control based on deterministic dynamic programming in order to minimize the individual economic costs and extreme grid power values. By using a coordination algorithm involving a central information processing unit, the neighboring PV battery systems are given information about the sum of the planned consumption and feed-in power profiles of the neighborhood, as well as the neighborhood tariffs. Based on these data, the PV battery systems successively optimize the operation of their batteries until either convergence or a maximum count of iterations is achieved. The operating principle of the distributed EM concept with coordination is demonstrated through a simulation of a residential neighborhood comprising eight households with different load profiles and varying PV peak powers and battery capacities. Its performance is compared with three EM concepts: two distributed concepts without coordination and another one with central optimizing EM representing ideal coordination. The resulting power flow distributions are analyzed, and the benefits and weaknesses of the developed coordination mechanism are discussed based on a number of evaluation criteria. © 2020 by the authors.","Coordination; Distributed control; Dynamic programming; Energy management; Lithium-ion battery; Local trade; Microgrid; Model predictive control; Optimization; Photovoltaic","Distributed parameter control systems; Dynamic programming; Dynamics; Electric load flow; Electric power system economics; Energy management; Energy management systems; Lithium-ion batteries; Model predictive control; Optimization; Coordination; Coordination algorithms; Coordination mechanisms; Distributed control; Financial incentives; Micro grid; Photovoltaic; Residential neighborhoods; Electric power system control","Kersic, M.; Belectric GmbH, Industriestraße 65, Germany; email: manuel.kersic@belectric.com",,"MDPI AG",19961073,,,,"English","Energies",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85078959644

The proposed system is utilized generated power from the standalone PV system along with diesel generator to replace the requirement of diesel by solar energy partially. The optimal hybrid system is obtained by using hourly measured solar radiation data and per liter cost of diesel for the selected location along with other required components. Performance analysis is done using Hybrid Optimization Multiple Energy Resources (HOMER). A comparative study based on percentage renewable penetration, total net present cost (TNPC), cost of energy (COE) and emitted pollutants has been carried out.

Therefore, this article presents the performance analysis in terms of energy efficiency, economic feasibility, and environmental sustainability of a photovoltaic (PV)/Stirling battery system. The analysis includes the dynamic start-up and cooling phases of the system, and then compares its performance with a hybrid photovoltaic (PV)/diesel/battery system, whose configuration is usually more common. Both systems were initially optimized in size using the well-known energy optimization software tool, HOMER. An estimated demand for a hypothetical case study of electrification for a rural village of 102 households, called ""Tacuaral de Mattos"", was also considered. However, since the characteristics of the proposed systems required a detailed analysis of its dynamics, a dynamic model that complemented theHOMER analysis was developed using MATLAB Simulink TM 8.9. The results showed that the PV/Stirling battery system represented a higher performance option to implement in the electrification project, due to its good environmental sustainability (69% savings in CO2 emissions), economic criterion (11% savings in annualized total cost), and energy efficiency (5% savings in fuel energy conversion). © 2020 by the authors.","Bidirectional inverter; Bolivia; Diesel genset; Hybrid power system; Lead-acid battery; Microgrid; PV panel; Stirling engine","Diesel engines; Electric batteries; Electric utilities; Energy conversion; Energy efficiency; Lead acid batteries; MATLAB; Photovoltaic cells; Stirling engines; Sustainable development; Bi-directional inverters; Bolivia; Diesel genset; Hybrid power systems; Micro grid; PV panel; Diesel electric power plants","Zabalaga, P.J.; Facultad de Ciencias y Tecnología, Universidad Mayor de San SimónBolivia; email: pabloadolfojimenezzabalaga@gmail.com",,"MDPI AG",19961073,,,,"English","Energies",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85080889253

Bangladesh has enough potential to produce electricity from solar photovoltaic (PV) and biomass. The aim of this work is to analyze the feasibility of hybrid solar PV and biomass generator (BG) based supply systems for providing sustainable power to the off-grid macro cellular base stations (BSs). The technical and economic aspects of the introduced system have critically been examined using the Hybrid Optimization Model for Electric Renewables (HOMER) optimization software under a wide range of network configurations. Besides, the wireless network has extensively been evaluated using Matlab based Monte Carlo simulations in terms of performance metrics such as throughput and energy efficiency, considering the dynamic traffic profile. Numerical results demonstrate that the hybrid solar PV/BG system is an attractive solution to the challenges of developing a green cellular network in the context of geographical location like Bangladesh for several advantages. The research finds that the hybrid supply system has sufficient excess electricity and backup capacity that increase the system reliability. It also identifies that the proposed system indirectly minimizes CO2 emission by reducing the biomass burning in cooking purposes.

The United States has employed the net metering mechanism. Both mechanisms have determined the price of the electricity injected to the grid energy be equal or higher than the grid electricity tariff. The accelerated cost reduction of PV technology has allowed, in diverse electricity markets, Grid parity. This circumstance has driven the revision and reformulation of the promotion mechanisms for distributed PV generation. This paper is a proposal to evaluate the net billing and selfconsumption mechanism and the impact on the business sustainability of the distribution system operators (DSOs); as well as the economic incentive for the residential user to become prosumer. The mechanism has applied to the electricity retail market of Arequipa, located in southern Peru, with a specific solar potential higher than 2000 kWh/kWp. The results showed that: The subsidized electricity tariff for consumer less than 100 kWh/month, would not reach full grid parity before 2020. For consumer of higher than 100 kWh/month, the net billing and self-consumption mechanism allows the promotion of distributed PV generation. In addition, the under net billing, DSO would maintain their business sustainability. Finally, under the net billing mechanism the user will have the incentive not to oversize the grid-connected PV power. © 2020, International Journal of Renewable Energy Research.","Distributed generation; Grid connected PV system; Incentives; Net billing",,"Villacorta, A.R.; Faculty of Sytems, Electronics and Industrial Engineering, Universidad Técnica de AmbatoPeru; email: a.rios@uta.edu.ec",,"International Journal of Renewable Energy Research",13090127,,,,"English","Int.

Due to the high investment outlays required for this technology and the interest for increasing its penetration, specific profitability analyses need to be conducted in order to find the key points that can be used by the government to contribute to promoting these investments. Three real photovoltaic projects were taken into account by considering the measured energy data during a year. In addition, the well-known Net Present Value method is used as the valuation metric. Results show that investment decisions on renewable distributed generation are significantly affected by technology costs, national financial conditions, and tariffs. The analysis also suggests that taxes included in the tariff structure under a Net Billing remuneration mechanism might be an important aspect to be taken into account during the investment valuation. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis over the capital cost and the consumed and injected energy price suggest that government policies should design the incentive mechanisms mainly over the cost of capital rather than over the exported energy tariff.

PV cell temperature is related to the ambient temperature, while the solar radiation incident on PV surface depends on the slope and azimuth of the PV panels. Furthermore, ground reflectance (albedo) affects the solar radiation incident on the PV surface and hence influences its performance. Nevertheless, the impact of some important factors on the PV performance such as the ground reflectance at different tilt angles and temperature coefficient of power under Middle East (temperate) climatic conditions are scarcely reported. In this research paper, a techno-economic analysis has been done to investigate the impact of temperature, tilt and azimuth angles, and ground reflectance on the performance of solar energy system. HOMER software was used as a tool in this study where Choman, Iraq, was selected as a case study. The results indicate that with a base case (temperature coefficient of − 0.48%/ °C, albedo of 20% and ambient temperature of 11 °C), facing the PV to south with a tilt angle of 40° or 45° results in the most economical system by having net present cost of $70595 and cost of energy of $0.54/kWh. Furthermore, PV modules with high sensitivity to temperature are found to be an attractive option based on Choman ambient temperature. Meanwhile, increasing the ground reflectance from 10 to 90% results in an increase of the annual optimum tilt angle from 38° to 52° and a decrease of the PV required capacity from 20.8 to 19.4 kW (for temperature coefficient of − 0.48%/ °C). The results prove that the studied parameters must be treated well to establish an enabling environment for PV development in Iraq. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Albedo, economic; Azimuth; Solar radiation; Temperature; Tilt angle",,"Tajuddin, M.F.N.; School of Electrical Systems Engineering, Universiti Malaysia PerlisMalaysia; email: faridun@unimap.edu.my",,"Springer",1387585X,,EDSNB,,"English","Environ.

Many thermo-electric plants are required to fill the gap and ensure energy supply. This paper thus proposes a hybrid renewable energy generation plant that could supply a percentage of the total energy demand and reduce the environmental impact of conventional energy generation. The hybrid plant works with a photovoltaic (PV) system and wind turbine systems, connected in parallel with the grid to supply a renewable fraction of the total energy demand. The investigation was conducted in three steps: The first stage determined locations where the energy system was able to take advantage of renewable sources, the second identified a location that could work more efficiently from an economic perspective, and finally, the third step estimated the number of PV solar panels and wind turbines required to guarantee optimal functioning for this location using, as a main method of calculation, the software HOMER pro® for hybrid optimization with multiple energy resources. The proposed system is expected to not only limit environmental impacts but also decrease total costs of electric grid consumption from thermoelectric plants. The simulations helped identify Puerto Bolivar, Colombia, as the location where the hybrid plant made the best use of non-conventional resources of energy. However, Rancho Grande was found to offer the system more efficiency, while generating a considerable amount of energy at the lowest possible cost. An optimal combination was also obtained-441 PV arrays and 3 wind turbines, resulting in a net present cost (NPC) of $11.8 million and low CO2 production of 244.1 tons per year. © 2020 by the authors.","Economic evaluation; Energy efficiency; Environmental impact; HOMER Pro software; On-grid system; Solar energy; Wind energy","Economic analysis; Electric power system economics; Electric power transmission networks; Energy management; Environmental impact; Location; Photovoltaic cells; Solar energy; Wind power; Wind turbines; Economic evaluations; Economic perspective; Environmental evaluation; Grid systems; Hybrid renewable energies; Method of calculation; Photovoltaic systems; Wind turbine systems; Energy efficiency","Álvarez, J.R.N.; Energy Department, Universidad de la Costa, Calle 58 Número 55- 66, Colombia; email: jnunez22@cuc.edu.co",,"MDPI AG",19961073,,,,"English","Energies",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85082737453

In Saudi Arabia, electric energy consumption is the highest in the domestic sector, with 48.1% of the total electricity consumption. As the power generation in Saudi Arabia mainly relies on conventional resources, environmental pollution and energy sustainability are major concerns. To minimize these issues, the Saudi government is in the process of maximizing the utilization of renewable energy resources for power generation. Investing in solar energy in Saudi Arabia is important because the country is witnessing a rapid increase in load demand, with annual growth rates of 6%. In this paper, the system advisor model software for renewable energy modeling has been utilized to perform a techno-economic feasibility analysis of a residential grid-connected solar photovoltaic (PV) system, which is proposed for a typical apartment in Saudi Arabia, on the basis of various key performance indicators, namely: yield factor, capacity factor, performance ratio, levelized cost of energy, net present value, internal rate of return, and payback period. A sensitivity analysis that investigates the impact of varying techno-economic parameters on system performance and feasibility is also discussed. The size of the PV system for a typical Saudi Arabian apartment is estimated to be 12.25 kW. Results have shown that the proposed system can generate 87% of the electricity needs of an apartment. The technical analysis showed that the capacity factor and the performance ratio were 22% and 78% respectively. The levelized cost of energy and net present value revealed competitive figures of 0.0382 $/kWh and $4378, respectively.

Based on the literature, energy, economic and environmental indicators were rarely simultaneously employed in the optimization of a hybrid renewable system. In addition, there is no procedures or a set of indicators to be applied uniformly in all applications for the shared analysis. The paper presents a novel energy-economic-environmental multi-criteria decision-making in the optimization of a hybrid renewable system, based on a new set of dimensionless indicators, proposed as a standard for future applications. The procedure compares the entire PV-wind-battery system configuration with the PV-wind, PV-battery and wind-battery system sub-configurations. A width parametric and multi-optimization analysis permit the identification of the most proper nominal powers of each system component. The procedure proposed was applied in a Mediterranean residential building, demonstrating that some system configurations allow complying simultaneously with at least two of the three energy objectives proposed, the cost-optimal level and the maximum reduction of emissions, for specific values of the load. The solar source was the most suitable both from energy, environmental and economic point of view, while the use of the wind source leads to a greater system operating time in the nominal power conditions. The study pointed out and quantified that, for specific loads, PV, wind and battery powers, the development of specific incentives for wind systems and of battery systems with a higher lifespan can help to make the hybrid systems more economically competitive. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Battery storage; Economic and environmental analysis; Energy; Incentives; PV-wind hybrid system; Renewable energy; Sizing and optimization","Battery storage; Decision making; Electric batteries; Hybrid systems; Energy; Environmental analysis; Incentives; Renewable energies; Wind hybrids; Economic analysis","Mazzeo, D.; Department of Mechanical, Energy and Management Engineering (DIMEG), University of Calabria, P.

To enable DR, the aggregator provides a competitive incentive price to end-users, and centrally optimizes the central ESS assets and schedule of committed customer elastic loads. Thus, customers reduce their daily electricity bill while the aggregator decreases the aggregated peak consumption and earns profits as a return for providing DR services.

Buildings have a significant influence on electricity consumption, and their management may contribute to the sustainability of the electricity sector. Additionally, with growing incentives in the distributed generation (DG) and electric vehicle (EV) industries, it is believed that smart buildings (SBs) can play a key role in sustainability goals. In this work, an energy management system is developed to reduce the power demands of a residential building, considering the flexibility of the contracted power of each apartment. In order to balance the demand and supply, the electrical power provided by the external grid is supplemented by microgrids such as battery energy storage systems (BESS), EVs, and photovoltaic (PV) generation panels. Here, a mixed binary linear programming formulation (MBLP) is proposed to optimize the scheduling of the EVs charge and discharge processes and also those of BESS, in which the binary decision variables represent the charging and discharging of EVs/BESS in each period. In order to show the efficiency of the model, a case study involving three scenarios and an economic analysis are considered. The results point to a 65% reduction in peak load consumption supplied by an external power grid and a 28.4% reduction in electricity consumption costs. © 2020 by the authors.","Distributed generation; Energy resource management; Mixed binary mixed binary linear programming; Optimization; Smart buildings","Buildings; Distributed power generation; Economic analysis; Electric energy storage; Electric power utilization; Energy management; Energy management systems; Energy resources; Intelligent buildings; Linear programming; Microgrids; Optimization; Sustainable development; Vehicle-to-grid; Battery energy storage systems; Binary linear programming; Charge and discharge; Electricity-consumption; Energy productions; Energy resource managements; Photovoltaic generation; Residential building; Electric power transmission networks","Ramos, S.; GECAD, Institute of Engineering, Polytechnic of PortoPortugal; email: scr@isep.ipp.pt",,"MDPI AG",19961073,,,,"English","Energies",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85082758032

The objective of this paper is to measure the degree of relationship between socioeconomic and geographic variables, with the level of insertion of residential photovoltaic (PV) generation technology in each federative unit in Brazil. The variables selected for this study were: (1) Human development index; (2) residential expenditure on electricity; (3) number of PV companies; (4) PAYBACK; and (5) solar irradiation index, based on the Brazilian Solar Energy Atlas developed by the National Institute for Space Research (INPE) in 2006. Five hypotheses were established. The methodology used to test these hypotheses was through the statistical analysis of Pearson’s correlation coefficient. Based on the obtained results, it can be concluded that the solar irradiation index is not a significant variable in the insertion process of residential PV distributed generation around the country; and where the residential expenditure on electricity is higher, are also the places that had the smallest installed PV systems. This may help the perception of the importance of each of the variables to increase the use of PV energy in Brazil. © 2020, Econjournals.

This paper evaluates the techno-economic and environmental benefits of deploying photovoltaic (PV)- battery systems in a livestock farmhouse. For the energy requirements of the farm to be determined, a walkthrough energy audit is conducted on the farmhouse. The farm selected for this study is located in southern Nigeria. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory’s Hybrid Optimization Modeling for Electric Renewable (HOMER) software was adapted for the purpose of the techno-economic analysis. It is found that a standalone PV/battery-powered system in farmhouse applications has higher economic viability when compared to its diesel-powered counterparts in terms of total net present cost (TNPC). A saving of 48% is achievable over the TNPC and Cost of Energy with zero emissions. The results obtained show the numerous benefits of replacing diesel generators with renewable energy sources such as PV-battery systems in farming applications.

In this perspective, a techno-economic feasibility study has been performed for a stand-alone remote area in Karnataka, India. In the present study, effect of use of Lead Acid (LA), Lithium-Ion (Li-Ion) batteries, and diesel generators with and without scheduling on the performance of HRES has been assessed. The Net Present Cost (NPC) and Cost of Energy (COE) of the proposed HRES using Li-Ion battery are found 35% lesser than to that of the system using LA battery. The pollutant emissions are also found to be reduced by using Li-Ion batteries in the system. Further, the effect of with and without scheduling of diesel generators on performance of HRES has also been investigated. From the results, it is found that a saving in NPC and COE with scheduling of diesel generator is found to be as $1,55,977 and 0.027 $/kWh. An attempt has also been made to find out the effect of the option without diesel generator in the proposed HRES. It is found that the proposed system without diesel generator is most feasible. Further, Li-Ion battery-based PV/MHP HRES offers the most optimal configuration and the corresponding NPC and COEs are found to be as $4,67,644 and 0.106 $/kWh.

This paper aimed to evaluate the techno-economic performance of an introduced hybrid microgrid (HMG) in eight climate zones of Iran. Therefore, ten cities are selected from the eight climate conditions of Iran. An electricity pricing strategy is also implemented according to the electricity tariffs defined by the Ministry of Energy (MOE) of Iran. The proposed electricity pricing strategy is applied to the HOMER software for investigating the optimal system configuration, RES electricity generation, and the economics of each understudy city. Optimization results indicate that Urmia (in moderate and rainy climate zone) has the least net present cost (NPC) (−5839$) and levelized cost of energy (COE) (−0.0122 $/kWh), whereas Golestan (in semimoderate and rainy climate zone) has the highest NPC (4520 $) and COE (0.012 $/kWh). It is shown that the combination of photovoltaic (PV)/wind turbine (WT)/converter in the grid-connected operation mode is the most economical configuration. Moreover, the cities with higher potentials of wind speed and solar irradiance have lower NPC and COE. It is concluded that the utilization of the battery energy storage (BES) is technically and economically infeasible for all eight climate zones, even if the stored electricity is sold to the grid. Two sensitivity analyses are conducted to the electricity feed-in-tariff (FiT) and solar module price, respectively. The first sensitivity analysis indicates that by increasing FiT, more contribution of RESs is seen, which leads to lower COE and NPC. Furthermore, the two cities of Urmia and Yazd have the highest NPC and COE reductions. The second sensitivity analysis studies the module price impacts on the NPC and COE of each understudy city. It is revealed that the PV module price has a considerable effect on NPC and COE. However, this effect is more significant in some cities such as Bam, where a linear relationship is seen between the module price and economic results (NPC and COE). © 2020 The Authors.

Since the building sector has emerged as a large energy consumer, in an effort to combat this trend, governments worldwide introduced various policies. The utilization of solar energy conversion systems are at the forefront of attention as they are considered carbon dioxide neutral and can be used in order to cover both electricity and heating load demands. Thus, these systems need to be thoroughly investigated taking into consideration the variations in the solar potential and the differences that exist in the electricity mix throughout Europe both in terms of cost, as well as of emissions, in order to assess their sustainability. In the current work a complete life cycle impact assessment is conducted for typical 4 kWp photovoltaic systems throughout Europe, and their environmental impact, sustainability, energy return on energy invested and payback period are calculated. The results highlight that although residential photovoltaic systems are considered “clean” and have a relatively low environmental impact throughout their life cycle, depending on the installation location and local electricity mix this might not be the case in the coming years. The energy return on energy invested ranges from 1.64 to almost 5 depending on location, while their simple payback period is less than 11 years in most cases, and as low as 5, without any subsidy. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Electricity grids; Life cycle assessment; Photovoltaics; Simple payback; Solar electricity","Artificial life; Carbon dioxide; Cost benefit analysis; Environmental impact; Investments; Photovoltaic cells; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Sustainable development; Electricity grids; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Photovoltaics; Simple payback; Solar electricity; Life cycle; carbon dioxide; cost analysis; electricity; environmental economics; environmental impact; heating; life cycle analysis; photovoltaic system; solar power",,,"Elsevier Ltd",03062619,,APEND,,"English","Appl.

This is accompanied by an increase in fossils fuels resources consumption and consequently negative environment effect. Demand-side management approach (DSM), energy efficiency, and renewable energy is a set of concepts that can help to reduce electricity demand are the key and actual solutions. Recently, a rooftop photovoltaic system (RTPVS) is an attractive alternative electricity source for households, their potential at any given location can be evaluated through simulation software and tools. This paper deals with the potential assessment of the rooftop grid-connected PV system under the weather conditions of Algiers (36◦45,2 N, 3◦3,5 E) in the north and Tamanrasset (22◦47,4 N, 5◦31,2 E) in the south of Algeria. A system of 5 kWp is simulated under various tilts angle from 0 to 90 degrees to find the optimal tilt one. Assessment of system energy yield, performance ratio (PR), capacity utilization factor (CUF) and specific energy (SE) are carried out, calculated and analyzed. Simulation results show, that 30° and 15° are respectively the optimal tilt angle for Algiers and Tamanrasset, which gives the high values of analyzed parameters. As a comparative analysis, the potential of the rooftop PV system at the Tamanrasset area is higher than in the site of Algiers. The average annual energy, PR, CUF, and SE of the simulated system was found to be (9681 kWh-7251 kWh) (78%-80%), (22,1%-16,55%), and (1936,2 kWh/kWp-1450,2 kWh/kWp) for Tamanrasset and Algiers, respectively. © 2019 SERSC.","Capacity utilization factor; Demand side management; Energy efficiency; Performance ratio; Rooftop photovoltaic system (RTPVS); Solar cell; Tilt angle",,"Haffaf, A.; Electro-Technical Department, Electro-Technical Engineering Laboratory, Faculty of Technology, Saida UniversityAlgeria; email: Azzoz28@hotmail.fr",,"Science and Engineering Research Support Society",20054238,,,,"English","Int.

The main aim and novelty of this study is to evaluate the impact on the benefit of these advanced control strategies in terms of performance (energy use and economic) for a wide range of boundary conditions (country/climate, occupancy and appliance loads). Short-term weather data and historic price data for the same year as well as stochastic occupancy profiles that include the domestic hot water load are used as boundary for a parametric simulation study for the system modeled in detail in TRNSYS 17. Results show that the control using a forecast of dynamic electricity price leads to greater final energy savings than those due to the control using thermal storage for excess PV production in all of the examined locations except Sweden. The impact on self-consumption using thermal storage of heat produced by the heat pump using excess PV production is found to decrease linearly with increasing household electricity for all locations. A reduction in final energy of up to 842 kWh year−1 can be achieved just by the use of these algorithms. The net energy cost for the end-user follows the same trend as for final energy and can result in cost savings up to 175 € year−1 in Germany and Spain due to the use of the advanced control. © 2020 by the authors.

Literature review shows that, although many studies exist, most of them did not fully consider the integrated techno-economic evaluation of building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) system. Therefore, this research aims to use the interoperability potential offered by applying a building information modelling BIM-friendly software to an integrated simulation tool to conduct a comprehensive techno-economic evaluation of a BIPV system in a building cluster. Through visual integration in a digital mock-up, the solar irradiation, surrounding shadings, BIPV location, BIPV components/system (string, inverter, battery), and economic analysis have been performed on a residential building cluster located in Ludvika, Sweden. The results show the optimal location for the 615 m2 BIPV system with a yielding of 27,394 kWh/year. Under the defined boundary conditions, the payback period is 10 years in the mixed feed-in and self-consumption mode, over its 20 years’ life span. Further sensitivity analysis of 18 cases is carried out in order to evaluate the impact of installation position (capacity), future climate change, shadings, and operating mode. This study will help improve decision-making by analysing the impact of the aforementioned factors on a BIPV system techno-economic performance. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

The use of integrated renewable-storage energy systems is a more beneficial solution to this problem over individual solutions; however, most design studies only focused on single-type buildings. Thus, this study aims to optimally design an integrated energy system for mixed-use buildings using HOMER Grid. The objective is to minimize the net present costs, subject to capacity limits, energy balances, and operational constraints. Economic metrics were used to evaluate and compare the proposed system to the varying design cases such as business-as-usual, stand-alone renewable source, and stand-alone energy storage. The case study considered a mixed-use building in a tropical area, with a solar photovoltaic system as the renewable energy source and lithium-ion battery as the energy storage system technology. The results show that the integrated system is the most financially attractive design case. It has a levelized cost of electricity of 0.1384 US$ kWh−1, which is significantly less than the 0.2580 US$ kWh−1 baseline. The system also provides electricity cost savings of 294 698 US$ y−1, excess electricity of 35 746 kWh, and carbon emission reduction of 550 tons annually for a mixed-use building with daily average consumption of 4557-kWh and 763-kW peak demand. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","energy storage system; mixed-use buildings; optimization model; renewable energy source; techno-economic analysis",,"Culaba, A.B.; Mechanical Engineering Department, De La Salle UniversityPhilippines; email: alvin.culaba@dlsu.edu.ph",,"John Wiley and Sons Ltd",0363907X,,IJERD,,"English","Int.

RMPV modules and energy conversion units are subject to anomalies which compromise power quality and promote fire risk and safety hazards for which reliable protection is crucial.

Dynamic Grid Parity Models combine learning curves with grid-parity. They are the state-of-the-art solution to assess the time-evolving competitiveness of generation technologies, but fail to capture the residential end-user's choices of installing Distributed Energy Resources once they become feasible. We propose a robust framework based on a local and optimal microgrid combined with learning curves to assess the potential penetration of Distributed Energy Resources in households. This framework adds a notably richer interaction between the elements of the distribution system, e.g., optimal dispatch or peak shaving. We quantify the time-evolution of residential end-user's bills and the utility's revenue, applied to four tariff designs. Today Chile pioneers a massive deployment of photovoltaic systems without incentives, becoming a unique example worldwide, specially the so called “Solar City of Diego de Almagro”, a town with a remarkable solar resource and massive PV deployment, chosen as the case study. Results show PV dominance with flat bundled volumetric tariffs and the increase of utility's bankruptcy risk if tariffs are not updated (47% revenue reduction). If updated, bills would increase 24%, affecting non-owners. A two-part tariff overcomes this but it is regressive and it delays PV deployment. A three-part tariff improves efficiency and introduces prosumage, with a small peak-shaving effect. Owners could face regulatory risks due to possible tariff design changes.

As an emerging PV technology, organic photovoltaics (OPV) have been recognized as potential bearer of economic and environmental gains. Yet, could OPV deliver a profitable investment and environmental impact reductions in the context of residential electricity self-consumption? Here, we conduct a study of unprecedented scoping that combines both economic analysis and life cycle assessment to gauge OPV self-consumption with or without battery storage for household settings. The upscaling of OPV technologies from pilot- to industrial scale was modelled, and we used the two contrasting cases of Denmark and Greece to identify potential patterns. Our economic results indicate that the addition of battery storage is not financially viable unless battery costs are reduced by more than 10% for Greece and 30% for Denmark. Furthermore, we identify OPV cost thresholds of 0.9 €/Wp for Denmark and 1.6 €/Wp for Greece, below which OPV-battery systems are more cost-effective than OPV systems without battery. Building on the economic analysis, we find that battery storage can improve the environmental performances of OPV systems under certain conditions on the battery costs, the capacity of the cost-optimal OPV-battery system, and the environmental impacts of the battery. Furthermore, the composition of the electricity grid mix in the country studied was found to be an important factor to determine where OPV self-consumption was environmentally beneficial. These findings can support energy policy-makers in their development of energy strategies as well as OPV technology developers, who should adopt a systemic approach and integrate battery storage and the balance of system within their development phases. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Cost optimisation; Economic analysis; Electricity self-consumption; LCA; Life cycle assessment; Organic photovoltaics","Cost benefit analysis; Cost effectiveness; Costs; Economic analysis; Electric batteries; Electric power transmission networks; Environmental impact; Environmental management; Environmental technology; Housing; Investments; Life cycle; Balance of systems; Cost optimisation; Economic and environmental performance; Economic development; Environmental performance; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Organic photovoltaics; Residential electricity; Battery storage; cost analysis; economic analysis; energy storage; environmental impact; equipment; industrial performance; life cycle analysis; performance assessment; photovoltaic system; Denmark; Greece","Laurent, A.; Quantitative Sustainability Assessment Group, Sustainability Division, DTU Management, Technical University of Denmark (DTU), Lyngby, Denmark; email: alau@dtu.dk",,"Elsevier Ltd",03062619,,APEND,,"English","Appl.

The impact of a number of technical and economic parameters on the profitability of a self-consumption residential system located in Madrid is assessed. The proposed solution comprises two kinds of heat stores: a low- or medium-grade heat store for domestic hot water and space heating, and a high-grade heat store for combined heat and power generation. Two cases are considered where the energy that is wasted during the conversion of heat into electricity is employed to satisfy either the heating demand, or both heating and cooling demands by using a thermally-driven heat pump. We compare these solutions against a reference case that relies on the consumption of grid electricity and natural gas and uses an electrically-driven heat pump for cooling. The results show that, under relatively favourable conditions, the proposed solution that uses an electrically-driven heat pump could provide electricity savings in the range of 70 – 90% with a payback period of 12 – 15 years, plus an additional 10 – 20% reduction in the fuel consumption. Shorter payback periods, lower than 10 years, could be attained by using a highly efficient thermally driven heat pump, at the expense of increasing the fuel consumption and the greenhouse gas emissions. Hybridising this solution with solar thermal heating could enable significant savings on the global emissions, whilst keeping a high amount of savings in grid electricity (>70%) and a reasonably short payback period (<12 years). © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","CCHP; Cogeneration; Energy storage; Heat; Photovoltaics; PHPS; Self-consumption; Solar; Stirling; TES; Thermal; Thermophotovoltaics; Trigeneration; Ultra-high temperature","Cogeneration plants; Economic analysis; Electric energy storage; Energy storage; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Heat pump systems; Heating; Heating equipment; Housing; Investments; Natural gasoline plants; Profitability; Pumps; Solar power generation; Space power generation; Tellurium; CCHP; Cogeneration; Photovoltaics; PHPS; Self-consumption; Solar; Stirling; Thermal; Thermophotovoltaics; Tri-generation; Ultrahigh temperature; Electric power transmission networks; combined heat and power; cooling; economic analysis; energy efficiency; energy storage; fuel consumption; greenhouse gas; heating; high temperature; photovoltaic system; power generation; profitability; pumping; solar power; technical efficiency","Datas, A.; Instituto de Energía Solar, Universidad Politécnica de MadridSpain; email: a.datas@ies.upm.es",,"Elsevier Ltd",03062619,,APEND,,"English","Appl.

Hence, this article proposes the design, simulation, and optimization of a stand-alone photovoltaic system (SAPV) to provide non-polluting electrical energy based on a renewable source for a rural house located in Tazouta, Morocco. Real monthly electrical demands and hourly climatic conditions were utilized. An initial design process indicated that, with a 1080 Wp total capacity of PV modules and 670 Ah of battery storage, the proposed SAPV system was able to meet a considerable part of the dwelling load with an average solar fraction of about 79.1%.

This paper reports a case study of transforming an existing residential cluster in Sweden into electricity prosumers. The main energy concepts include (1) click-and-go photovoltaics (PV) panels for building integration, (2) centralized exhaust air heat pump, (3) thermal energy storage for storing excess PV electricity by using heat pump, and (4) PV electricity sharing within the building cluster for thermal/electrical demand (including electric vehicles load) on a direct-current micro grid. For the coupled PV-heat pump-thermal storage-electric vehicle system, a fitness function based on genetic algorithm is established to optimize the capacity and positions of PV modules at cluster level, with the purpose of maximizing the self-consumed electricity under a non-negative net present value during the economic lifetime. Different techno-economic key performance indicators, including the optimal PV capacity, self-sufficiency, self-consumption and levelized cost of electricity, are analysed under impacts of thermal storage integration, electric vehicle penetration and electricity sharing possibility. Results indicate that the coupled system can effectively improve the district-level PV electricity self-consumption rate to about 77% in the baseline case. The research results reveal how electric vehicle penetrations, thermal storage, and energy sharing affect PV system sizing/positions and the performance indicators, and thus help promote the PV deployment.

The renewable hybrid system consists of a wind turbine, a photovoltaic field (PV), a diesel generator (DG), converters and batteries. Hybrid Optimization of Multiple Electric Renewables (HOMER) software has been used to assess the techno-economic feasibility. Four scenarios are evaluated and modeled by HOMER. A comparison of economic feasibility, renewable fraction, total emissions, and excess of electricity for all the scenarios is done. For an interest of 7%, the optimum hybrid system (PV/battery) has a levelized cost of energy (COE) of 0.236$/kWh, which is lower than the COE of the other hybrid systems (PV/DG/battery, PV/Wind/battery and PV/wind/DG/battery) which are respectively, 0.242, 0,270 and 0.274 $/kWh. The Sensitivity analysis was also investigated in the intent to present the impact of changing the interest rate, battery increase, solar radiation, and the load demand increase on the performance of the hybrid system. The sensitivity results elucidate that the PV/Battery hybrid system is still viable for all interest rates ranging from 7 to 10% compared to PV/DG/Battery and PV/Wind/DG/Battery that are also report good economic performance but still suffer from harmful emissions. The combination of PV and batteries together ensures a clean electricity production compared to the PV/DG/Battery and PV/Wind/DG/Battery. The latter present a total CO2 emission of 5200 kg/year with an increase of the COE that achieves 50% for DG/battery system. Furthermore, the hybrid system combining PV with batteries gives a high renewable fraction compared to the second optimal system. © 2019 International Journal of Renewable Energy Research.","HOMER pro software; Hybrid system; Off grid; Optimization; Sensitivity",,"Ladide, S.BP 575 Boulevard Abdelkrim Al Khattabi, Morocco; email: saad.ladide@gmail.com",,"International Journal of Renewable Energy Research",13090127,,,,"English","Int.

The Priority PV output is analyzed as negative demand and modifies, directly, the profile demand of the microgrid. The hourly change of kW output of PV modules at the site is obtained from the website of Surface Meteorology and Solar Energy, sponsored by NASA, using HOMER software. It is observed that at any solar insolation power output from the solar module is directly proportional to the module capacity. To plan the best economic solar PV capacity incorporation in the system, PV output is varied over a suitable range and in discrete steps, depending on hour of profile electric demand and availability of solar insolation at the site. At each modified tracking of hourly electrical demand, Pareto-bi-objective EELD optimization is performed, simultaneous with compromised reduction between the cost of fuel and NOX emission of the DERs. The sets of results of best optimal output of sharing of strategically deployed DER-mix could be obtained and these results are kept within their respective capacity limits. For optimization both differential evolution (DE) and PSO algorithms is used for comparison of results. Hourly heat demand requires to be met by waste heat recovery from DERs and, if required, by stand-by boiler. An array is formed of these best solutions per annum for each solar PV capacity change. These results, in comparison with the No-PV base case results, are used for economic analyses based on benefit-to-cost ratio (BCR). It is found that best BCR value of 1.416 occurs at PV capacity of 130 kW and so, the best PV capacity size is decided as 130 kW. © 2019, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Benefit-to-cost ratio; Differential evolution; HOMER; Microgrid; Solar PV",,"Basu, A.K.; N.I.T.M.A.S.

Therefore, enhancement of the resiliency of electrical systems during emergency situations is essential. By using the concept of standby redundancy, this paper proposes two different energy systems for increasing load resiliency during a random blackout. The main contribution of this paper is the techno-economic and environmental comparison of two different resilient energy systems. The first energy system utilizes a typical traditional generator (TG) as a standby component for providing electricity during the blackouts and the second energy system is a grid-connected microgrid consisting of photovoltaic (PV) and battery energy storage (BES) as a standby component. Sensitivity analyses are conducted to investigate the survivability of both energy systems during the blackouts. The objective function minimizes total net present cost (NPC) and cost of energy (COE) by considering the defined constraints of the system for increasing the resiliency. Simulations are performed by HOMER, and results show that for having almost the same resilience enhancement in both systems, the second system, which is a grid-connected microgrid, indicates lower NPC and COE compared to the first system. More comparison details are shown in this paper to highlight the effectiveness and weakness of each resilient energy system. © 2019 the authors.

However, its intermittent nature and dependence on geographical location possess a major challenge to design renewable energy system for sustainable utilization of solar energy. In this study, site-specific solar resource assessment using statistical parameters, HOMER based techno-economic assessment, and environmental impact analysis are done to design an optimal solar PV-battery based system for water supply station of a remote area of Silchar, India. The results show that two years’ average daily accumulated global solar radiation is 3.67 kWh/m2-day and the clearness index reveals that 73.5% of the days have partly clear or complete clear sky conditions. The Linke turbidity factor ranges from 3.5 to 5.5. The HOMER simulation results show that 257,014 kWh of energy is produced annually by the PV-battery system and the per-unit cost of energy is found to be $0.307/kWh. The environmental analysis shows that a maximum 98.16% reduction in CO2 emission can be achieved when compared to conventional fuel-based plant.

However, they could be reused in other applications such as energy storage stations. In this paper, an economic evaluation of reusage of lithium-ion packs for load leveling in the residential, industrial and photovoltaic power plants sectors have been investigated from subscriber and government aspects. Several repurposed electric vehicle battery packs have been taking into account for different tariffs and scenarios. It is found that utilization of battery can reduce electricity bill for residential consumers by 14.25% based on the current electricity market and 39.75% if the fine of the peak time consumption is tripled. However, the current subsidy rate in the electricity tariffs is the main barrier in terms of the payback period for homeowners. Moreover, it is found that decrease in the battery prices by 2035 as the only factor will not justify usage of repurposed battery in residential sector, furthermore, tariffs must also be regulated. Sensitivity analysis declared that a 20% reduction in the price of battery in residential sector, affects the internal rate of return by 164%. Meanwhile, increasing in the on-peak tariff can fluctuate it by 44%. Reusing electric vehicle batteries could be more profitable in the industrial sector due to the realistic tariff. In addition to the operation cost, government saving is analyzed from the initial cost aspect. Results illustrated that utilization of repurposed battery packs can reduce construction costs of new on-peak thermal power plants by 72.5% and 82% in the residential and industrial sectors, respectively. Finally, the effect of using repurposed lithium-ion battery packs on the emission rates of greenhouse gases and other air pollutants are surveyed.

Mexico is a privileged country in terms of its solar resource availability. However, it also has tremendous challenges, which it must encounter in the medium term to promote pollution emission reduction and support strategies contributing to sustainable development. Therefore, in this study, we verified the state-of-the-art implementation of an interconnected photovoltaic system network and reviewed the current legislation for photovoltaic energy in Mexico. Besides, we performed an energy savings analysis for solar photovoltaic technology implementation on a large scale in urban and rural homes in Mexico by using the Geographic Information System. The results showed potential for energy savings with the use of an interconnected photovoltaic system network at a large-scale. Based on the information processed through 187,719 urban and 4,525 rural locations, it could be inferred that in Mexico, each household needs four photovoltaic panels on average to satisfy its energy requirements. Thus, even with implementation in homes alone, the country could achieve energy savings of an estimated 39,750 GWh, equivalent to 20.27 Tg of CO2 avoided emissions, i.e., 3% of the annual national emissions. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Geographic information system; Households; Mexico; Photovoltaic systems; Solar potential","Developing countries; Emission control; Energy conservation; Geographic information systems; Information systems; Information use; Photovoltaic cells; Planning; Potential energy; Solar concentrators; Energy requirements; Households; Me-xico; Photovoltaic systems; Photovoltaic technology; Solar photovoltaic system; Solar photovoltaic technology; Solar potential; Solar power generation","Rosas-Flores, J.A.; Instituto Tecnológico de Tlalpan, Cerrada de Santa Cruz #4 Pueblo de San Miguel Topilejo, Mexico; email: jorge.rosas.flores@gmail.com",,"Elsevier Ltd",13640321,,RSERF,,"English","Renewable Sustainable Energy Rev",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85072782348

One of the well-known solutions is to store the energy and convert it into a more stable form, to transform again into electricity during periods of high demand, in which the energy has a higher value. This process provides economic viability for most energy-storage projects, even for the least efficient and most common, such as batteries. Therefore, this paper aims to propose a storage system that operates with gravitational potential energy, considering a small-scale use. The development of this methodology presents the mathematical modeling of the system and compares the main characteristics with other systems. The dimensions of the considered system are 12-m shaft, 5-m piston height, and 4 m of diameter; it presented an energy storage of 11 kWh. Also, it has an efficiency of about 90%, a lifetime of 50 years, and higher storage densities compared to other systems. © 2019 by the authors.","Gravitational energy; Solar energy; Storage system",,"Rocha, L.A.O.; Department of Mechanical Engineering, Polytechnic School, University of Vale do Rio dos Sinos, Av.

As a load management system becomes smarter, it is necessary to fully explore the interactive ability among users and make schemes for OPU more applicable. Therefore, an intelligent multi-agent apanage management system that includes a mutual aid mechanism (MAM) is proposed. In the decision-making scheme, users’ participation patterns and the potential of peak shifting and willingness are considered, as well as the interests of both power consumers and power grid are comprehensively considered. For residential users, the charging time for their electric vehicles (EVs) is managed to consume the locally distributed power generation. To fully exploit user response potential, the algorithm for improved clustering by fast search and find of density peaks (I-CFSFDP), i.e., clusters the power load curve, is proposed. To conduct electrical mutual aid among users and adjust the schemes reasonably, a multi-objective optimization model (M2OM) is established based on the cluster load curves. The objectives include the OPU control cost, the user’s electricity cost, and the consumption of distributed photovoltaic (PV). Our results of a case study show that the above method is effective and economical for improving interactive ability among users. Agents can coordinate their apanage power resources optimally. Experiments and examples verify the practicability and effectiveness of the improved algorithm proposed in this study. © 2019 by the authors","Demand-side response; Improved clustering by fast search and find of density peaks (I-CFSFDP); Multi-agent system; Multi-objective optimization; Orderly power utilization","Charging time; Clustering algorithms; Costs; Curve fitting; Decision making; Economics; Electric power utilization; Intelligent agents; Multi agent systems; Multiobjective optimization; Demand side response; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Electricity costs; Fast search; Intelligent multi-agent; Management systems; Multi-objective optimization models; Supply and demand; Electric power transmission networks","Zuo, D.; College of Electrical Engineering, Shanghai Dianji UniversityChina; email: zuods@sdju.edu.cn",,"MDPI AG",19961073,,,,"English","Energies",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85076114468

Historically, VOE values have dropped rapidly and will further, yet slower, decline in the future. Additionally, VOE values for residential and utility installations converge at different levels, indicating a stronger diversification of these market segments. Similarly, local differences in VOE suggest a regional market diversification. Advanced concepts like n-type monocrystalline PERC silicon solar cells could be economically preferable to multicrystalline silicon solar cells in some countries but may fare worse in others, including China and India. Extending the analysis to tandem photovoltaics, we confirm its potential to improve LCOEs for residential applications but foresee challenges for utility markets. Finally, we explore detrimental impacts of degradation and show that competing for lower LCOEs demands matching degradation rates of established technologies. What is the value of increasing the efficiency of a solar cell? In this paper, we introduce the value of efficiency (VOE), a metric that determines the maximum allowable cost for an innovation to improve the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE). We then use this metric to analyze trends. Looking at historical data, we find that the VOE has declined rapidly in the past. Looking forward we still project a reduction but at a much-reduced pace. In addition, we observed that different markets converge at different values, indicating a technology diversification to better address different needs. One example is tandem solar cells, a high-efficiency photovoltaic (PV) concept that could help to provide electricity cheaper to homes in the future. We also observe a variation depending on location, indicating that different technologies could flourish regionally. Finally, we highlight the vital need for new PV technologies, like perovskites, to match leading technologies degradation rates. Here, we introduce the value of efficiency (VOE), a metric that determines the maximum allowable cost for an innovation to improve the levelized cost of electricity. We use this metric to analyze historic, regional, and technological trends. We find indications for a stronger regional and sectoral market diversification.

A residential net-zero energy building with a prospect of commercialization was introduced, which adopts solar energy systems and heat insulation solar glass that simultaneously generates electric power and minimizes heat loss. Dynamic and parametric simulation models were developed based on the TRNSYS platform and were validated by experimental data or standard test reports. A multi-criteria decision-making framework based on the energetic and economic criteria was developed to evaluate system performance and to find the favorable layout of the energy system in the residential net-zero energy building. Twelve system scenarios, covering the individual heat insulation solar glass system, the hybrid systems integrated with solar PV, solar thermal and heat insulation solar glass, and the hybrid systems combined solar thermal and heat insulation solar glass, were comparatively assessed. Among the system scenarios inclusive of solar thermal technology, a combination of the compound parabolic concentrated solar collector and variable-effect absorption chiller is highly recommended. However, the system scenario, which consists of a specific PV area of 8.4 m2/kW and employs heat insulation solar glass, is most favorable due to a highest primary energy saving ratio of 1.05 and a lowest levelized total cost of 5920 US$/year. All system scenarios proposed herein are not economically feasible at the current economic parameters in Singapore's climate. However, the optimized hybrid system (integrated with solar PV, solar thermal and heat insulation solar glass) is sufficient to reach the net-zero energy target while the optimized solar PV system combined heat insulation solar glass is a solution of the positive energy building. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Economic analysis; Energy saving; Heat insulation solar glass; Residential net-zero energy building; Solar cooling","Decision making; Economic analysis; Electric insulation; Electric losses; Energy conservation; Energy utilization; Glass; Housing; Hybrid systems; Simulation platform; Solar concentrators; Solar energy; Solar heating; Thermal insulation; Multi-criteria decision making frameworks; Net-zero energy buildings; Positive energy buildings; Primary energy savings; Solar cooling; Solar glass; Solar thermal technology; Total energy consumption; Zero energy buildings; building; commercialization; cooling; economic analysis; electricity generation; energy efficiency; insulation; photovoltaic system; residential energy; solar power; Singapore [Southeast Asia]","Wang, C.-H.; Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, National University of Singapore, 4 Engineering Drive 4, Singapore; email: chewch@nus.edu.sg",,"Elsevier Ltd",03062619,,APEND,,"English","Appl.

The first method is to act on the supply side by integrating alternative means of power generation, such as renewable energy generators, having a relatively low levelized cost of energy. Whereas, the second methodology focuses on the management of the load to minimize the overall paid cost for energy. Thus, this article highlights the importance of demand side management by comparing it to the supply side management having, as criteria, the total achieved savings on the overall annual energy bill of a residential microgrid supplied by two power sources and equipped with an electric vehicle. The optimization takes into consideration the cost of kWh that is paid by the prosumer based on an economical model having as inputs the outcomes of the energy model. The adopted energy model integrates, on the demand side, an intelligent energy management system acting on secondary loads, and on the supply side, a photovoltaic (PV) system with and without battery energy storage system (BESS).

Different solutions are proposed, such as demand side management and energy storage systems. Nevertheless, costs and environmental impacts of some technologies (e.g. batteries) are high. This paper proposes two system designs: Home Energy Storage (HES) and Community Energy Storage (CES). Besides electricity storage, heat storage is used in the two system designs to supply domestic hot water and space heating. Furthermore, the trade-offs between the different storage mediums in relation to costs are analyzed. To achieve that, different methodologies are used to size the electricity and heat storage mediums for HES and CES. Next, a multi-objective mixed integer linear programming model is developed to optimize the operation costs and CO2-emissions for each system design. After that, the model is tested on a residential community situated in Cernier (Switzerland). The results demonstrate that CES performs better than HES on economic and environmental performance due to economies of scale and the optimally sized storage capacity of the battery in CES. Currently, none of the proposed system designs is economically feasible. However, the sensitivity analysis shows that a profitable system design can be obtained for both HES and CES, when the electricity storage (i.e. battery storage) size is reduced and the heat storage (i.e. water storage tank) size is increased. © 2019 The Authors","Batteries; Demand side management; Energy storage systems; Heat pumps; Hot water tanks; Self-consumption","Demand side management; Economic and social effects; Economics; Electric batteries; Electric energy storage; Energy management; Environmental impact; Environmental management; Environmental technology; Heat storage; Hot water distribution systems; Housing; Integer programming; Sensitivity analysis; Solar cells; Storage management; Systems analysis; Water; Water tanks; Community energy storages (CES); Economic and environmental performance; Energy storage systems; Heat pumps; Hot water tanks; Mixed integer linear programming model; Residential energy systems; Self-consumption; Energy management systems; demand-side management; energy planning; energy storage; linear programing; pump; residential energy; sensitivity analysis; warm water; water storage","Terlouw, T.; Copernicus Institute of Sustainable Development, Utrecht University, Princetonlaan 8a, Netherlands; email: t.m.terlouw@students.uu.nl",,"Elsevier Ltd",03062619,,APEND,,"English","Appl.

In this study, the feasibility of a hybrid energy system for electrification of a residential building located in Kish Island, Iran is assessed. The building has 10 stories, a lobby and a parking garage. Initially, the building loads that include electrical, heating, cooling, and lighting are calculated by EnergyPlus software. Then, HOMER software is employed to optimize the system configuration. The average building load and the peak power are found to be 2.2 MWh/day and 206 kW, respectively.

The electricity accessibility of rural area in Malaysia is not fully covered and the cost of extending the grid to these areas can be high as RM 2.7m per km. Lack of vigorous policies and economic attraction of the rural areas are also the main barriers to rural electrification. Electricity is an essential element of economic activities and the lack of electricity exacerbates poverty and contributes to its perpetuation. Therefore, a hybrid standalone power system can be an alternative solution for the rural electrification. A hybrid standalone power system is studied to investigate the potential of the implementation and the budget required. Design/methodology/approach: A site survey has been carried out in a village in Peninsular Malaysia, namely, Kampung Ulu Lawin Selatan. A standalone hybrid system is modeled in HOMER Pro software and the data collected from the selected site are used to obtain the system configuration with the lowest COE. The load following and cycle charging energy dispatch methods are compared to identify the optimal system configuration that yields the lowest COE. The diesel generator-only system is chosen as a benchmark for comparisons. Findings: The results show that the hybrid system constituted from the diesel generator, photovoltaic (PV), micro-hydro and energy storage using the load following energy dispatch method yields the lowest COE of RM 0.519 per kWh. The COE of the hybrid system is 378 per cent lower than that of the diesel generator-only system. The lead-acid energy storage system (ESS) is able to reduce 40 per cent of COE as compared to the system without ESS. Originality/value: The results indicate that the COE of the diesel-micro hydro-PV-ESS system with load following dispatch strategy is RM 0.519 per kWh, and this value is 35 per cent higher than the average electricity price in Malaysia. However, it is important to note that the costs of extending the grid to the rural area are not taken into account. If this cost is considered into the electricity price, then the standalone hybrid power system proposed by this study is still a competitive alternative for rural electrification. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Cost minimization; Project economics","Budget control; Costs; Diesel engines; Digital storage; Economics; Electric energy storage; Electric utilities; Hybrid systems; Hydroelectric generators; Rural areas; Cost minimization; Design/methodology/approach; Energy storage systems; Optimal system configuration; Project economics; Stand alone power systems; Stand-alone hybrid power systems; Stand-alone hybrid system; Electric load dispatching","Chua, K.H.; Universiti Tunku Abdul RahmanMalaysia; email: chuakh@utar.edu.my",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",17506220,,,,"English","Int.

Available studies on HRES seem to concentrate only on its techno-economic and environmental viability. In so doing, these studies do not seem to underline the likely challenges that follow the acquisition of HRES by especially low-income households. The ensuing reality is, of course, a limitation in the use of HRES in homes with low incomes. It is therefore imperative to analyze how a household with low income can afford this kind of energy system. The purpose of this study, therefore, lies in presenting a techno-economic, environmental and affordability analysis of how HRES is acquired. Design/methodology/approach: To arrive at a grounded analysis, a typical household in SSA is used as an example. The analysis focused on the pattern of energy use, and this is obtained by visiting an active site to evaluate the comprehensive load profile. In the course of analysis, an optimal techno-economic design and sizing of a hybrid PV, wind and battery were undertaken. Additionally, an acquisition analysis was done based on loan amortization. Findings: The interesting result is that a combination of the photovoltaic-gasoline-battery system is the most cost-effective energy system with a net present cost of $2,682. The system combination can lead to an emission reduction of approximately 98.3 per cent, compared to the use of gasoline generating sets, common mostly in SSA. If an amortized loan is used to purchase the energy system, and the payment plan is varied such that the frequency of payments is made quarterly, annually, semi-annually, bi-monthly, semi-monthly and bi-weekly, it will be observed that low-income household can conveniently acquire a HRES. Originality/value: The result presented a framework by which a low-income household can purchase and install HRES.

Results show that 8.7–10.2% of 2015 electricity consumption could have been avoided by upgrading all residential units to comply with Energy Star standards. The range for this estimate stems from uncertainty on whether, under business-as-usual conditions, most buildings comply with the 1978 or the 1996 energy building codes. These energy savings would have implied a reduction of 3–4% in the costs of running the current power generation fleet and a 9–11% reduction in CO2 emissions. If this level of EE had been paired with the installation of roof-top PV providing 6.1–6.4% of the total electricity generated, the costs of operating the system would have been reduced by 8.6–9.6% and CO2 emissions would have been 24–26% lower. This level of roof-top PV penetration is the maximum permissible under this EE scenario due to the reductions it causes to daily peak electricity consumption and the limited operational flexibility of the nuclear plants. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Building codes and standards; Carbon dioxide emissions; Distributed solar; Economic dispatch; Energy efficiency; Renewables integration; Residential electricity demand; Roof-top photovoltaic (PV); Unit commitment","Building codes; Carbon dioxide; Cost benefit analysis; Cost reduction; Electric load dispatching; Electric power generation; Electric power utilization; Global warming; Housing; Nuclear fuels; Nuclear power plants; Roofs; Scheduling; Solar power generation; Uncertainty analysis; Carbon dioxide emissions; Codes and standards; Distributed solar; Economic Dispatch; Photovoltaic; Renewables integrations; Residential Electricity demands; Unit-commitment; Energy efficiency; alternative energy; building code; carbon dioxide; emission inventory; energy efficiency; energy policy; photovoltaic system; policy analysis; power generation; solar power; standard (reference); North Carolina; South Carolina; United States","Patiño-Echeverri, D.; Duke University, 9 Circuit Drive, Grainger Hall 3118, United States; email: dalia.patino@duke.edu",,"Elsevier Ltd",03014215,,ENPYA,,"English","Energy Policy",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85071993429

The high upfront cost (for which many residential customers are unwilling to take risks) is and will remain one of the main obstacles that need to be tackled in order to achieve a faster and a greater deployment of the distributed PV technology in the residential sector as a local generation source. Understanding the economics of the residential PV installation is a key aspect to determine whether the financial investment in this sector is economically feasible and reasonable or not. Thus, it is essential to conduct a comprehensive economic analysis to encourage residential consumers to be PV adopters. The main purpose of this work is to present an Integrated Economic Adoption Model (IEAM) for distributed PV systems. This IEAM is composed of four modules: (1) economic assessment of four different proposed electricity retail tariff structures; (2) profitability analysis of these proposed electricity retail tariff structures based on the most common economic indicators: Net Present Value (NPV), Internal Rate of Return (IRR), Discounted Payback Period (DPBP), and Profitability Index (PI); (3) sensitivity analysis of different variables which strongly affect the PV system profitability; and finally, (4) Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE) probability distribution based on the Monte Carlo Analysis (MCA). The model is implemented using Microsoft Excel spreadsheet based on a real dataset for one year of PV generation and residential load consumption for 54 customers in the Ausgrid's electricity network, New South Wales (NSW), Australia (as case study) under the current market arrangements and PV support policies. The model can be easily adapted to any location by changing the generation and load profiles and the relevant economic assumptions and electricity regulatory policies. The outcomes of this IEAM should guide the decision makers in different distribution networks in designing their retail tariff structure and PV support policies and to conduct economic feasibility analysis for residential and commercial PV projects with different sizes in different locations within their networks. Also, the IEAM answers the investment profitability questions for the household owners under real integrated system uncertainty. © 2019 The Authors","Economic Adoption Model; Feed in tariff; Monte Carlo analysis; Net metering; Profitability analysis; Sensitivity analysis","Cost benefit analysis; Decision making; Earnings; Housing; Investments; Monte Carlo methods; Photovoltaic cells; Probability distributions; Profitability; Renewable energy resources; Sales; Sensitivity analysis; Spreadsheets; Adoption model; Feed-in tariff; Monte carlo analysis; Net metering; Profitability analysis; Economic analysis","Ellabban, O.; Iberdrola Innovation Middle East, Qatar Science & Technology Park, Tech 1 Building, Office 204, PO Box 210177, Qatar; email: oellabban@iberdrola.com",,"Elsevier Ltd",23524847,,,,"English","Energy Rep.",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85062465543

By managing their own self-generation, customers are able to place natural selection pressure on utilities to evolve. The devised techno-economic simulation model projects residential PV and battery investment decisions over 20 years in Perth, Australia to quantify the potential market impacts from policy and customer investment conditions. Using real-world demand and insolation profiles from 261 households, this research evaluates how cumulative customer PV and battery investments changes the network and market operating conditions, while under the influence of various feed-in tariff values. The results indicate that high feed-in tariff policy costs in the short-term, make it economically challenging to prevent or restrain significant residential PV-battery adoption in the longer-term. Moreover, continuous increases in residential PV-battery system installations eventually lead to annual net-exports substantially exceeding net-imports on the distribution network.

It is unclear, however, whether this transition is occurring equitably across the state's various demographic and socioeconomic groups and whether historically disadvantaged environmental justice (EJ) communities have been able to exploit the bill savings and other associated benefits of rooftop solar. Here we analyze the cumulative and annualized (spatial and temporal) rates of PV adoption across California and compare those with data from the state's cumulative impact EJ methodology (CalEnviroScreen). We find persistently lower levels of PV adoption in disadvantaged communities, suggesting clear distributive and equity impacts of existing PV support policies, and indicating that the benefits bypass some of the state's most vulnerable populations. The analysis reveals strong correlation of solar adoption with not only socioeconomic variables, but also with health, environmental and demographic indicators, contributing to our growing understanding of the role these factors play in household clean-energy adoption trends.

Therefore, the average of solar radiation per month for Zabol and Zahak were about 9 and 9.1 (h/d). Also, mean wind speeds are calculated 5.35 m/s and 4.7 m/s for Zabol and Zahak respectively which proposed that these cities have high potential in order to electrical production by a hybrid system. Furthermore, the amount of electricity production by PV array for Zabol and Zahak were 1700 (kWh/yr) and 1669 (kWh/yr) respectively, and the amount of electricity production by wind turbine were 9036 (kWh/yr) and 7263(kWh/yr) for Zabol and Zahak respectively.

The aim of the research is the optimization of the sizing of the system elements chain (photovoltaic generator, electrolyzer, tank, fuel cell) with respect to the electric load to fulfil. A positive annual balance between hydrogen production and consumption must be guaranteed; furthermore, energy production surplus that cannot be stored or converted into hydrogen due to batteries or tanks capacity limits must be avoided. The energetic analysis and that of hydrogen production and consumption have been carried out on an hourly basis using the HOMER software. The study shows that, being the load active in the evening and the system disconnected from the grid, excess energy cannot be exploited unless large tanks are used, if high gas pressures are to be avoided. Consequently, the system use in public areas or residential buildings, where visual impact generated by tanks is hardly acceptable and safety rules do not allow high gas pressures, is advisable only in grid-connected configurations.

The performance of the mode-based economic model-predictive control approach is used as the benchmark. The residential load and PV data used in this paper are 1-min data downloaded from the Pecan Street Project website. The optimal operation mode for each control interval is first derived from the historical data used as the training set. Then, four ML algorithms (i.e., neural network, support vector machine, logistic regression, and random forest algorithms) are applied. We compared the performance of the four algorithms when using different number of features and length of the training sets extracted from different months of the year. Simulation results show that using the ML approach can effectively improve the performance of the mode-based control system and reduce the computation effort of local controllers because the training can be completed on a cloud-based ML engine. The work presented in this paper paves the way for using a shared-learning platform to design controllers of residential PV/storage systems.

Such socio-technical transitions offer substantive support to address energy poverty and act as a key tool to realise human well-being, economic prosperity, and environmental conservation envisioned under Sustainable development goals (SDGs). In this study, households using solar photovoltaic were surveyed to determine prospects of solar energy use in rural communities. The participants include rural households from Uttar Pradesh, India that had received i) a small scale and subsidised solar systems, ii) obtained paid connection from solar microgrids, and iii) those who purchased solar systems for power reliability. We report high satisfaction with distributed solar photovoltaic among rural households. The factors influencing a desire to procure additional solar power include income, level of education, duration of solar use, user satisfaction, time of day for the power supply and financial support for procurement. Our findings also suggest that freely given solar power offers limited incentives for procuring more solar power. We further analyse the policy of welfare using energy justice as a conceptual tool. This can explain paradoxical aspects of subsidies that are widely used as a socio-political tool to improve quality of life for those that are disadvantaged but fail to address fundamental structural aspects of the energy system that are underscored by procedural justice issues. We propose policies for distributed clean energy in emerging countries must address concurrent energy transitions and energy justice frameworks to support sustained decentralised solar transitions. Without these two foundations operating in tandem, carbon lock-in and the energy poverty cycle will be inexorably linked. © 2019 The Author(s)","Clean energy access; Energy justice; Energy poverty; Rural communities; Subsidies","Carbon; Energy utilization; Environmental protection; Solar concentrators; Solar energy; Solar system; Sustainable development; Clean energy; Energy justices; Energy poverties; Rural community; Subsidies; Solar power generation","Sarkodie, S.A.; Nord University Business School (HHN), Post Box 1490, Norway; email: asumadusarkodiesamuel@yahoo.com",,"Elsevier Ltd",2211467X,,,,"English","Energy Strateg.

New dynamics are occurring with cities becoming vectors of sustainable development, through initiatives like the Covenant of Mayors. Innovative approaches and tools are required to support city development planning in compliance with climate change mitigation goals. City planning and management are typically addressed through a fragmented and silo approach, failing to capture the dynamics and complexity of a city energy system. Integrated energy system modelling tools are progressively incorporating increasing realism to enhance results quality and confidence. This paper demonstrates the effects of including household budget constraints in integrated energy system optimisation modelling on low carbon city pathways. The TIMES_EVORA model was used to characterize current and future city energy system, covering all its chain, from energy supply sectors (e.g. electricity production) to end use sectors (e.g. residential and transport). Optimal solutions for meeting Évora municipality (Portugal) 2030 greenhouse gases emissions targets were assessed, combining household budget constraints for the acquisition of more efficient technologies – from appliances to private vehicles. The results showed a decrease of hybrid vehicles ownership in 2030 and a consequent increase of diesel vehicles. The optimal model solution shows a persistence in the acquisition of highly efficient households' appliances and the deployment of additional PV systems to facilitate a reduction of the electricity generation CO2 footprint.

However, there are not many studies that examine whether estimated savings are actually realized or not. The objective of the study is to compare estimated savings with actual savings using statistical and econometric approaches of data analysis. Based on a sample of solar adopters located in the United States of America, this study finds that actual savings are on average 20% higher than estimated savings, but they are also relatively more spread out than estimated savings. One possible explanation for a lower estimated savings is the inability of models to fully capture favorable changes in household habits, the electric rate structure, and weather. Factors that are correlated with higher estimated savings are more technical (photovoltaic size-to-load ratio, floor area, and age of house) and do not necessarily matter for actual savings. Higher initial electricity bills are positively correlated with higher actual savings on average, but not with estimated savings. There is some room for making solar estimate models more customizable, indicating best and worst case scenarios depending on changes in household habits and exogenous factors. Finally, for the sample of solar adopters in this study, customers’ perception on savings is fairly correct in reflecting the deviation between actual and estimated savings. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Econometrics; Economics; Electricity bill; Net metering; Solar adopters","Economics; Housing; Photovoltaic cells; Solar concentrators; Statistics; Econometrics; Electricity bill; Net metering; Solar adopters; Solar photovoltaic system; Techno-economic model; United States of America; Worst case scenario; Solar power generation; accuracy assessment; econometrics; electricity; equipment; photovoltaic system; solar power; United States",,,"Elsevier Ltd",03062619,,APEND,,"English","Appl.

Roughly half of the CO2 emissions from Czech building stock are estimated to be allocated to residential buildings. Approximately one-third of the Czech residential building stock have already been retrofitted, but retrofitting mostly takes place in large cities due to greater income. A favourable concept for the mass retrofitting of residential building stock, affordable even in low-income regions, was of interest. For a reference building, multi-criteria assessment of numerous retrofitting measures was performed. The calculation involved different building elements, materials, solutions, and energy-efficiency levels in combination with various heating systems. The assessment comprised environmental impact, represented by operational and embodied primary energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, and investment and operational costs using the annuity method. Analysis resulted in the identification of favourable retrofitting measures and showed that complex building retrofitting is advantageous from both a cost and an environmental point of view.

Implementing such systems at building level can facilitate the development of net-zero energy buildings. Energy system planning is a multi-faceted problem that involves technical, economic, environmental, and social dimensions, and affects multiple stakeholders at different levels. A multi-objective optimisation approach is needed to identify the optimal energy choices at building level, while paying attention to stakeholder priorities and other constraints. The objective of this study is to develop a model to identify the optimal mix of renewable energy (RE) while also accounting for uncertainties, which can be integrated at building level with life cycle thinking. A framework was proposed for planning an optimised hybrid RE system at building level to support the net-zero development goals. The optimisation model was developed considering the objectives of minimising energy system cost, maximising operational cost savings, minimising the life cycle environmental impacts, and maximising the RE fraction. A combinatorial optimisation approach was adopted to reflect the practical engineering aspects of energy planning problems based on technologies available in the market. The developed framework was demonstrated through a case study conducted for an average multi-unit residential buildings (MURB) located in British Columbia, Canada. The results indicated that under the defined stakeholder priorities and constraints, ground source heat pumps and solar photovoltaics (PV) are the optimal energy choices for MURB, and the optimal energy system combination supplied 44% of the building's energy demand through RE. The findings will inform and guide community developers and other stakeholders with an interest in residential buildings, on the most suitable clean energy options for their building project during the pre-project planning stage. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Fuzzy logic; Hybrid renewable energy systems; Life cycle assessment; Net-zero buildings; Optimisation","Artificial life; Combinatorial optimization; Environmental impact; Fossil fuels; Fuzzy logic; Geothermal heat pumps; Housing; Life cycle; Multiobjective optimization; Renewable energy resources; Solar power generation; British Columbia , Canada; Decentralised energies; Environmental and economic impacts; Hybrid renewable energy systems; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Life-cycle environmental impact; Net-zero energy buildings; Optimisations; Zero energy buildings","Hewage, K.; School of Engineering, The University of British Columbia | Okanagan Campus, EME4287 - 1137 Alumni Avenue, Canada; email: kasun.hewage@ubc.ca",,"Elsevier Ltd",03787788,,ENEBD,,"English","Energy Build.",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85069683123

The residential sector is the largest consumer of electricity, accounting for approximately 59% of the overall consumption of electricity. As energy subsidies lead to budget deficits and overconsumption of carbon resources, there is a pressing need to examine the residential load profile to better understand consumption patterns and uncover potential solutions for more efficient usage. Residential load profiles are typically influenced by seasonal and socio-economic factors. Furthermore, household load profiles can be used to examine the viability of rooftop photovoltaic (PV) systems. In this study, a total of 10 houses in Qatar were chosen, and their power demand was monitored for over a year using smart energy monitors. This empirical research was conducted to achieve the following goals: (1) creation of the first high-resolution residential load profiles in Qatar and in the Gulf region; (2) analyses of the acquired load profiles and the determining factors that affect energy consumption; and (3) calculation of self-consumption values, analysis of the viability of household rooftop PV systems, and discussing potential use-cases for energy storage systems. Investigation of this topic is particularly important for Qatar as the country is adopting a sizable portion of PV systems (5% by 2021) and promotes sustainable energy options as a part of a national development strategy. Results show that there are significant differences between per-household and per-capita consumption due to factors such as electricity subsidies, household income and size, and air-conditioner type. Moreover, due to high electricity consumption, distributed energy storage units for bill management applications have limited applicability with current pricing tariffs. To the best of authors' knowledge, this is the first study conducted in Qatar and in the Gulf region where a growing amount of interest is given to measure and improve building energy performance. © 2019 by the authors.","Building consumption; Electricity monitoring; Energy storage systems; Rooftop photovoltaic (PV) systems; Self-consumption","Air conditioning; Budget control; Economics; Electric energy storage; Electric power utilization; Housing; Building energy performance; Distributed energy storages; Electricity monitoring; Electricity-consumption; Energy storage systems; Management applications; Photovoltaic systems; Self-consumption; Energy utilization","Bayram, I.S.; Division of Sustainable Development, College of Science and Engineering, Hamad Bin Khalifa UniversityQatar; email: ibayram@hbku.edu.qa",,"MDPI AG",19961073,,,,"English","Energies",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85074925789

To do this, it combines satellite-based and statistical data sources with machine learning to provide a reliable assessment of the technical potential for rooftop PV electricity production with a spatial resolution of 100 m across the European Union (EU). It estimates the levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) using country-specific parameters and compares it to the latest household electricity prices. The results show that the EU rooftops could potentially produce 680 TWh of solar electricity annually (representing 24.4% of current electricity consumption), two thirds of which at a cost lower than the current residential tariffs.

There is a constant debate on whether V2G is an economically viable option due to the high battery degradation cost. In this work, the cost benefit of EV customers participating in V2G has been studied using different feed-in tariffs (FITs). A model is developed for minimization of energy cost for residential users, which includes an EV, a separate energy storage system (ESS), and renewable energy supply. Key factors such as the EV driving usage, the degradation cost of EV and ESS batteries are considered. The EV driving usage is established through a designed survey, from which the probability of vehicle parking and plug in at home, the probabilities of EV under driving and parking outside can be calculated. Comprehensive case studies have been undertaken to investigate the optimization strategies under various scenarios. Two types of electricity tariffs, time-of-use (TOU) and fixed tariffs, are considered. It is revealed that certain threshold levels of FITs are expected to allow users benefit from V2G. Compared with non-optimized operation, the cost saving with the optimized strategy is evident in the case studies. © 2018 IEEE.","battery degradation; driving usage; Electric vehicle (EV); energy cost optimization; energy storage system (ESS); photovoltaic (PV); vehicle to grid (V2G)","Charging (batteries); Cost benefit analysis; Degradation; Electric discharges; Electric energy storage; Electric power transmission networks; Electric vehicles; Housing; Optimization; Probability; Solar cells; Vehicle-to-grid; Battery degradation; driving usage; Electric vehicle charging; Energy cost; Energy storage systems; Photovoltaic; Vehicle to Grid (V2G); Secondary batteries","Yue, H.; Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University of StrathclydeUnited Kingdom; email: hong.yue@strath.ac.uk",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",19493029,,,,"English","IEEE Trans.

The model is based on the use of renewable (wind turbines &amp; solar photovoltaic (PV)) and conventional (gasoline generators) energy sources and battery storage systems. We conducted a detailed assessment of a typical microbank's load, residential loads and energy resources in a village called Ajasse-Ipo in Kwara State, Nigeria. We performed the modeling of a hybrid microgrid system, followed by an economic analysis and sensitivity analysis to optimize the hybrid system design. We performed simulations based on the energy resources available (solar PV, wind, gasoline generator &amp; battery energy storage system) to satisfy the energy demands of the microbank, while the excess energy was supplied to meet the demand of the community loads, i.e. water pumping machine and rural home lighting. The results obtained showed that the hybrid system comprising the solar PV/battery/diesel was most techno-economically viable with a Net Present Cost (NPC) and Cost of Energy (COE) of $468,914 and 0.667$/kWh, respectively. Comparing these results with those obtained using analytical methods, the solar PV, battery and converter sizes obtained were slightly higher than the optimal system configurations as produced by HOMER. The proposed hybrid energy system also allowed to achieve almost 50% reductions in CO2, CO, unburned hydrocarbons, particulate matter, SO2 &amp; NO2.

One drawback of PV system diffusion is the potential for a rebound effect, a well-known economic response through which potential energy savings are partially offset by increased demand resulting from lower energy costs. Our work differs from the existing literature, however, because the rebound effect associated with the adoption of rooftop PV is due not to an improvement in energy efficiency, but to the availability of a zero-marginal cost alternative to grid electricity. This paper develops a novel method for estimating the rebound effect for rooftop PV based on economic and geographic information systems modeling. The method is illustrated through a numerical example, using neighborhood-level data from Fulton County, Georgia, USA. We discuss possible applications of our proposed method, which include (i) enhancing the predictive capability for conventional power grid managers in balancing forecasted demand with dispatchable supply, and (ii) aiding policy makers in designing policies to mitigate the rebound effect associated with solar PV adoption. © 2019","Energy consumption; GIS modeling; LiDAR; Photovoltaic system; Rebound effect; Renewable intermittency","Electric power transmission networks; Energy conservation; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Housing; Numerical methods; Optical radar; Photovoltaic cells; Potential energy; Conventional power; GIS modeling; Grid electricity; Intermittency; Photovoltaic systems; Predictive capabilities; Rebound effect; Residential photovoltaic; Photovoltaic effects; alternative energy; energy use; GIS; lidar; modeling; photovoltaic system; residential energy; solar power; Fulton County [Georgia]; Georgia; United States","Toroghi, S.H.; School of Building Construction and School of Computer Science & Engineering, Georgia Institute of TechnologyUnited States; email: toroghi@gatech.edu",,"Elsevier Ltd",03062619,,APEND,,"English","Appl.

Consequently, the homeowner has to pay an annual electric bill because the cost of imported energy is usually higher than that of exported energy. Installing a local battery energy storage system (BESS) can reduce the electric bill by exchanging less energy with the grid. This paper proposes a method of determining the optimal size of a BESS for a typical NZE home with rooftop solar photovoltaic (PV) system to minimize the annual net payment for electricity and battery cost. The optimal battery size is determined through solving an optimization problem which is formulated using hourly load and PV generation data for a South Australian home, battery annual payment rate, retail price (RP), and feed-in tariff (FIT). The effects of interest rate, RP and FIT on the annual net payment are investigated. The results obtained are thoroughly analysed and clearly indicate that, with current installation cost of BESS and South Australian RP and FIT, the use of a local BESS is economically beneficial for the homeowner. © 2019","Battery energy storage system; Energy cost; Net zero energy home; Optimal battery size; Rooftop PV system","Costs; Digital storage; Electric batteries; Photovoltaic cells; Solar power generation; Battery energy storage systems; Battery size; Energy cost; PV system; Zero energy homes; Battery storage; cost analysis; energy efficiency; energy storage; fuel cell; installation; photovoltaic system; power generation; Australia; South Australia","Sharma, V.; School of Engineering, University of South AustraliaAustralia; email: vanika.sharma@mymail.unisa.edu.au",,"Elsevier Ltd",09601481,,,,"English","Renew.

A project sustainability assessment framework was structured to support the initiative. First, an on-campus solar photovoltaic (PV) system was designed. The project performance in terms of financial cost and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions was assessed using life cycle cost analysis (LCC) and a life cycle assessment (LCA), respectively. Then, we explored the incorporation of positive social impacts on the local community in the context of natural disaster-prone Japan. Indicators for improving the disaster resilience of the residents were defined based on the Sendai Framework. Our results showed that the proposed solar PV system could provide an electricity self-sufficiency rate of 31% for the campus. Greenhouse gas emissions of 0.0811 kg CO2-eq/kWh would decrease the annual emissions from campus electricity use by 27%. Considering the substituted daytime electricity purchase, a payback period of 12.9 years was achievable. This solar PV system could serve as an emergency power source to 4666-8454 nearby residents and 8532 smart city residents.

Battery size is one of the most important factors that impact the financial return since it determines the major operational capabilities of the solar-coupled storage system. To select the optimal battery size for a photovoltaic solar customer, it is important to perform an analysis taking account of the customer's on-site generation and consumption characteristics. However, in most cases there are insufficient pre-existing data of the required quality making it difficult to perform such analysis. In this paper, we propose a model that can achieve satisfactory battery sizing results with a limited amount of net meter electricity data. The model uses K-means clustering on customer net meter electricity data to discover important information to extrapolate limited input net/gross meter energy data and uses this in a techno-economic simulation model to determine the optimal battery size. The approach is validated using a set of 262 solar households, two tariff structures (flat and Time-of-Use)and a naive forecasting method as a comparison to the proposed model. The results indicate that the proposed model outperforms the alternative baseline model and can work with as little as one month of net meter energy data for both of the evaluated tariff structures. On average, the model results in 0.10 normalised root mean squared error in yearly battery savings and net present values, 0.07 normalised root mean squared error in annual electricity costs and a r-squared value of 0.717 in finding the optimal size of batteries. Moreover, this study reveals a linear correlation between the used clustering validity index (Davies-Bouldin Index), and errors in estimated annual battery savings which indicates that this index can be used as a metric for the developed battery sizing approach. With the ongoing rollouts of net meters, the proposed model can address the data shortage issue for both gross and net meter households and assist end users, installers and utilities with their battery sizing analysis. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Clustering; Energy storage; Smart meter; Solar energy","Costs; Digital storage; Electric energy storage; Energy storage; Errors; Housing; Investments; K-means clustering; Mean square error; Quality control; Sales; Smart meters; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Clustering; Clustering validity index; Davies-Bouldin index; Forecasting methods; Linear correlation; Operational capabilities; Residential energy; Root mean squared errors; Electric batteries; cluster analysis; cost analysis; data acquisition; electricity; energy storage; equipment; model; photovoltaic system; residential energy; solar power; tariff structure","Tang, R.; Computer Engineering Laboratory, University of SydneyAustralia; email: rui.tang@sydney.edu.au",,"Elsevier Ltd",03062619,,APEND,,"English","Appl.

This paper presents a qualitative, interview-based, comparative study of how homeowners adapt their practices to the changing systems of electricity provision in two countries, Pakistan and Denmark. It reveals that household practices like laundering are flexible, highly contextualised and embedded in the wider socio-material and cultural context. In Denmark, time-shifting of laundering in households with photovoltaics is done voluntarily and closely interwoven with the temporal rhythms of the common dual-income household, as well as the natural cycles of the sun and weather, and is in most cases based on some degree of automation. In Pakistan, blackout schedules dictate time-shifting of most practices. Large family sizes and nuanced clothing make laundering more complex, socially bound and time-consuming; however, joint family systems, provision of house-staff and outsourcing make it more time-flexible and less dependent on automation and electricity-use. Using theories on temporalities of practices in a cross-cultural analysis highlights the significance of local socio-material and cultural context in the performance, bundling and synchronisation of practices. While practice theories prove useful in cross-cultural comparison of temporalities of household practices and demand, further theory development is needed to conceptualise practices as shared or socially differentiated entities in varying cultural contexts. This has implications for demand management policies proposed in smart-grid transitions as well as in the possible cross-cultural transfer of smart technology and demand response strategies. © 2019, The Author(s).","Developed countries; Developing countries; Electricity consumption; Household practices; Smart infrastructure; Time-shifting","Developing countries; Economic analysis; Electric power transmission networks; Electric power utilization; Laundering; Solar power generation; Developed countries; Electricity-consumption; Household practices; Smart infrastructures; Time-shifting; Smart power grids; culture; demand-side management; developing world; energy efficiency; household energy; infrastructural development; international comparison; smart grid; temporal variation; Denmark; Pakistan","Khalid, R.; Department of Architecture, University of Cambridge, 1 Scroope Terrace, United Kingdom; email: rk538@cam.ac.uk",,"Springer",1570646X,,,,"English","Energy Effic.",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85059643310

As the policy landscape is shifting and financial incentives for renewables are increasingly phased out, a nuanced understanding of homeowners' intention to install solar panels is key for reaching a broad market appeal. By analysing a dataset of 408 Swiss homeowners' stated preferences in the context of building retrofits, this paper identifies two key segments of likely solar adopters, including a premium segment preferring coloured and building integrated solar modules, and a value segment with more price-sensitive customers. Differences between likely adopters and likely non-adopters, as well as between two distinct segments of likely adopters, are investigated along sociodemographic, psychographic, and social aspects. Our analysis shows that aesthetic aspects of solar panels are key for expanding the customer base, and that likely adopters are more likely than likely non-adopters to be surrounded by neighbours, friends, and relatives who have already installed solar panels. Our results also reveal that the premium segment cares more about aesthetic aspects in general purchasing decisions and shows higher ecological concern than the value segment. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Building integrated photovoltaics; Choice experiment; Consumer segmentation; Peer effects; Residential solar energy; Solar panels","alternative energy; climate change; energy market; experimental study; incentive; mitigation; photovoltaic system; residential energy; segmentation; solar activity; solar power; Switzerland","Petrovich, B.; University of St. Gallen, Institute for Economy and the Environment (IWÖ-HSG), Rosenbergstr. 51, Switzerland; email: beatrice.petrovich@unisg.ch",,"Elsevier B.V.",09218009,,ECECE,,"English","Ecol.

Results include: (1) an observed neighbor effect, especially between census blocks within a radius of 1000 m; (2) evidence that diffusion is positively influenced in a census block by lower population density and higher number of household members, as well as by lower ratios of detached houses and lower population densities in nearby census blocks; and (3) indication that diffusion is positively influenced by a higher proportion of young people through various mechanisms. To further facilitate the diffusion, implementing non-economic measures designed in light of the observed neighborhood influences is recommended, in addition to conventional economic support measures. © 2019, The Author(s).","Demographic structure; Living environment; Peer effects; Solar photovoltaic power generation; Spatial autoregression",,"Kosugi, T.; College of Policy Science, Ritsumeikan University, 2-150 Iwakura-cho, Japan; email: kosugi@sps.ritsumei.ac.jp",,"Springer Tokyo",1432847X,,,,"English","Environ.

As a partial contributor to this goal, Solar Home Systems (SHSs) are an increasingly affordable and reliable option for low-income, informal settlement, urban households to initially access electricity (for at least lighting and media) in a manner that bypasses the legal, financial and practical barriers that often impede grid electrification. Other authors have argued for adaptive hybrid models for delivering and scaling access to SHS so that synergies between government- donor- or market-led approaches can be harnessed to achieve truly universal, and thus equitable, access. We look at two case studies of SHS delivery models that could, if combined, embody some of the envisaged benefits of the hybrid idea. The first case study is a social enterprise in South Africa that operates as a subsidised fee-for-service solar electricity utility. The emphasis is on efficient operating systems combined with local job creation, which together help to minimise running costs and thus maximise end-user affordability and produce wider local economic benefits. The second case study, in Zimbabwe, uses well-established social processes and women-led savings groups to build strong organisational capacity and accountability within the community. This establishes a robust social contract and a resilient mechanism for technical delivery and grass-roots information flow. The respective strengths and weakness of these two models appear to dovetail in a way that supports the case for a combination of the two approaches in a partnership with a shared core mission of advancing SDG 7 for under-served residents of informal settlements in Sub-Saharan Africa. © 2019","Informal settlement upgrading; Partnerships; Service delivery; Solar home systems; Solar photovoltaic; Universal energy access",,"Conway, D.; iShack Project, Sustainability Institute, Lynedoch Eco Village, South Africa; email: damian.conway@ishackproject.org.za",,"Elsevier Ltd",22146296,,,,"English","Energy Res.

We do this by investigating power generation and hydrogen production via renewable energy resources (mainly solar and wind) to produce synthetic fuels by capturing CO2 from the atmosphere. Nine different renewable energy systems are considered based on photovoltaic (PV), wind turbines (WT) and combinations thereof, including battery banks and hydrogen technologies. We used the Hybrid Optimization Model for Multiple Energy Resources (HOMER Pro) microgrid software to simulate the optimum size of system components and to identify the cost-effective configurations based on particular locations. When considering minimum COE, the results show that integration of PV, WT, a battery bank, an electrolyser and a hydrogen tank are at 0.50 $/kWh at Golden, Colorado, USA. We also found that without a battery bank, the minimum COE is 0.78 $/kWh at the same location. In this case, the cost increase is due to the capital cost of system components, mainly the hydrogen technologies. The results of this study suggest that hydrogen has economic benefits over batteries for long-term energy storage in off-grid energy systems. © 2019","Battery; Hydrogen; PV; Synthetic fuels; Techno-economic; Wind","Alcohol fuels; Cost effectiveness; Economic analysis; Electric batteries; Electric power system economics; Hydrogen; Hydrogen fuels; Hydrogen storage; Location; Renewable energy resources; Solar power generation; Synthetic fuels; Wind; Wind turbines; Battery; Hybrid energy system; Hybrid optimization; Hydrogen technologies; Renewable energies; Renewable energy systems; Techno-Economic analysis; Techno-economics; Hydrogen production","Mérida, W.; Clean Energy Research Centre, The University of British ColumbiaCanada; email: walter.merida@ubc.ca",,"Elsevier Ltd",01968904,,ECMAD,,"English","Energy Convers.

The rapid development in renewable energy technologies, growth of energy markets, and adopted financial strategies and policies have the key role in achieving this target. This paper provides a comprehensive feasibility analysis of a gird-isolated hybrid renewable energy system for electrification of agriculture and irrigation area in Dongola, Sudan. A systematic and integrative framework combined with techno-economic optimization analysis for adequate planning and design of hybrid renewable energy system is proposed. Different hybridization cases of a solar photovoltaic, wind turbine, diesel generator, battery storage, and converter technologies, together with a diesel generator-based energy system as base case are modeled, evaluated and compared considering the stochastic behavior of renewable energy resources with a main target to find the most feasible and reliable solution with least system cost and realistic environmental impacts. This followed by a sensitivity analysis to reveal the effects of uncertainty in system parameters on the designed system and its economic performance. The obtained results indicate that solar-wind-diesel-battery-converter hybrid system is of optimal performance and superiority over the studied cases to serve the load demand of the investigated area. The system not only gets the minimum values of the total net present cost (24.16 M$) and levelized cost of energy (0.387 $/kWh), but also effectively achieves a positive return on investment of 39.94% and around 95% reduction in both carbon emissions and fuel consumption compared to the base case. Meanwhile, the result of sensitivity analysis demonstrates the high dependability of system cost on the volatility of solar radiation and wind speed as well as the changes in the rate of interest with the prospect of ignoring the effect of variation of diesel fuel price in the future investment decision. Finally, the output of this study is projected to raising the potentiality awareness of renewable energy in Sudan and providing a valuable reference about the optimal planning and utilization of hybrid renewable energy system in energy sector. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon emissions; HOMER Pro®; Hybrid renewable energy; Net present cost; Sensitivity analysis; Techno-economic optimization","Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Diesel engines; Economic analysis; Electric batteries; Electric utilities; Energy policy; Environmental impact; Environmental technology; Hybrid systems; Investments; Irrigation; Photovoltaic effects; Planning; Sensitivity analysis; Solar power generation; Stochastic systems; Uncertainty analysis; Water management; Wind; Wind turbines; Carbon emissions; Hybrid renewable energies; Hybrid renewable energy systems; Integrative framework; Net present cost; Renewable energy technologies; Sustainable energy systems; Techno-economics; Renewable energy resources","Elkadeem, M.R.; School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and TechnologyChina; email: elkadeem@hust.edu.cn",,"Elsevier Ltd",01968904,,ECMAD,,"English","Energy Convers.

The purpose of this study is to understand the drivers of the purchase intent for rooftop (RT) solar. This will enable policymakers to improve the penetration of this new and promising green technology. Design/methodology/approach: This research leverages the framework of unified theory of acceptance and use of technology 2 (UTAUT2) to identify and build a quantitative approach to identify factors (and their relative impact on) the purchase intent of a domestic RT solar buyer. The 400 respondents’ field data were collected in Bangalore (a high RT solar penetration region) and Delhi NCR (relatively lower RT solar penetration region). Findings: The exploratory factor analysis study revealed that the consumers’ purchase intention of RT Solar is shaped by seven main factors, namely, environmental concerns, social beliefs, hedonic motivation, performance expectancy, price value, self-efficacy and effort expectancy, and that these factors explain 79.2 per cent of the field data. This study finds that social beliefs followed by effort expectance concerns are key factors explaining approximately 20 per cent of the purchase intent each, while unit change in price value beliefs explain about 18 per cent of the purchase intent. Practical implications: Suggested policy measures include building on strengthening emergence of local solar evangelist groups in the communities and easing effort expectance items (e.g. building legal, regulatory frameworks and financial tools for solar penetration models such as renewable energy services companies).

Furthermore, solar-PV homes integrated with hybrid or electric vehicles (EVs) are emerging as a paradigm for future homes. Given the fact that there exists a considerable price difference between grid electricity supply and FiTs, decision making of energy storage using batteries becomes an imperative topic. This research proposes an innovative and generic framework for the decision making of energy storage using batteries based on Smart Meter data, which incorporates the actual energy generation and consumption patterns of solar-PV homes. The proposed energy storage decision is based on a developed economic model, with the consideration of the electricity price from the grid, the FiTs, and the storage cost using batteries (i.e. the average price per kWh of battery capital cost and maintenance cost). Moreover, an intelligent algorithm is developed to calculate the electricity quantities, i.e. electricity supplied from the grid, fed into the grid and stored in a battery of a given capacity, based on the monitored data obtained from a Smart Meter over a year. The results reveal that at the present utility prices of $0.3/kWh and a feed-in-tariff of $0.10/kWh in the studied region, energy storage with a battery cost of $0.2/kWh or more is excessive and not economically feasible. However, with the increasing cost of electricity in recent years and constant changes in battery price, the outcomes could quickly reverse.

The case study is a building with 20 families. The power consumption of a family at a peak is considered by 4 kW. So, this combined system must provide a power of 80 kW. First a hybrid organic Rankine cycle is proposed and assessed by exergy and exergoeconomic methods. The results of exergy analysis indicate the overall exergy efficiency of the system is 7.29%. As well as, the greatest exergy destruction is related to the photovoltaic panels with a value of 337.16 kJ. The outcomes of the exergoeconomic assessment showed that, the highest and lowest capital investment cost rate belong to the photovoltaic panels (54233 $/year)and condenser (7092 $/year), respectively. Also, the product cost rate is calculated by 5.2 million $/year. In continue, to identify the key parameters which influence on the total performance of the ORC system, a parametric analysis is done. Because of the hybrid organic Rankine cycle has a high amount of the cost of energy, seven renewable hybrid energy systems are proposed and modeled by HOMER software. The results show the optimum energy system for this residential area is the hybrid PV – wind-diesel – battery. This configuration has a net positive cost of 268,592 $ and a cost of energy of 0.197 $/kWh. At the end of this study, to find the impact of the variations of the fuel cost and peak load on system performance, a parametric analysis was carried out. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Economic analysis; Exergy analysis; HOMER software; Hybrid energy systems; Organic Rankine cycle; Renewable energy","Economic analysis; Exergy; Housing; Hybrid systems; Investments; Photovoltaic cells; Rankine cycle; Renewable energy resources; Exergy Analysis; Homer softwares; Hybrid energy system; Organic Rankine cycles; Renewable energies; Cost benefit analysis","Jahangir, M.H.; Renewable Energies and Environmental Department, Faculty of New Sciences and Technologies, University of TehranIran; email: mh.jahangir@ut.ac.ir",,"Elsevier Ltd",01968904,,ECMAD,,"English","Energy Convers.

In Morocco, solar energy investments are rapidly rising since 2009 and are expected to grow dramatically in the next decade. Site selection is a critical issue when large-scale solar plants are being planned. In this paper, the multi-criteria evaluation method is used to identify suitable sites to host Photovoltaic projects in southern Morocco. For this purpose, geographical information systems and analytic hierarchy process methods were combined to represent a high-resolution map that compares the potential of the studied region to host large-scale Photovoltaic projects. HOMER software was then used for modeling and simulating a 10 MW grid-connected PV system. The optimum scheme is analyzed to assess the economic feasibility in the most suitable site in the Souss-Massa region. The findings from this study confirm that 24.08% of the studied area offers suitable sites to host the Photovoltaic farms.

A model of a smart residential district is proposed. Different charging scenarios (CS) for private cars are considered for simulating different power demand distributions during the day. Four different case studies are investigated, namely the Base Case, in which no EVs are present in the district and three study cases with different CSs. A global optimisation method based on a genetic algorithm approach was applied on the model to find the total power from PV panels installed and co-generative micro gas turbines while minimising the annual energy cost in the district for the four different scenarios. In conclusion, the results showed that the use of EVs in the district introduces considerable savings with respect to the Base Case. Moreover, the impact of the chosen CS is nearly insignificant under a purely economic perspective even if it is relevant for grid management. Additionally, the optimum amounts of installed power vary in a limited range if the distance travelled by EVs, users’ departure and arrival time change broadly. © 2019, The Author(s).","Co-generation; Distributed generation; Electric vehicles; EV charging strategy; Genetic algorithm; Micro-turbines; Photovoltaic panels; Smart residential district",,"Longo, M.; Dipartimento di Energia, Politecnico di Milano, Via La Masa, 34, Italy; email: michela.longo@polimi.it",,"Springer Verlag",20089163,,,,"English","Int.

This study uses an eco-efficiency analysis (EEA) framework to explore the environmental and economic performance of the current hybrid RAPS systems in Western Australia. The framework integrates life cycle assessment (LCA), eco-efficiency strategies, life cycle costing (LCC) and eco-efficiency portfolio analysis to propose eco-efficiency improvement of these systems. The results show that improving the load restriction of diesel engines, installing exhaust gas recirculation on diesel engines and installing rooftop solar PV on the residential houses of the RAPS system could potentially reduce life cycle CO2 emissions by 9% and the life cycle cost by 1%.

Given that a majority of the energy-deprived population lives in rural regions of developing countries, an effective rural electrification is critical for bridging the rural-urban divide. Building on energy access intervention, implementing productive energy services can influence the next stages of development through livelihood activities, microenterprises, lifestyle energy services, value-added activities, survival irrigation, and so on. Social benefits of access to healthcare, education, and longer productive hours have an equally important impact on sustainable development. In India, for example, 240 million people lack electricity access. While grid extension in India is on the rise through various government programs, specific rural problems of low energy demand, poor rural economy, inaccessible terrain, and low purchasing power can render grid extension expensive and inefficient. Microgrid electricity systems, especially with hybrid renewable energy resources, can be a good alternative for addressing above-mentioned challenges. India enjoys high solar intensity, and the predominantly agrarian rural society has enough biomass resources, abundant cattle dung, forest foliage, and agricultural waste. A solar-biomass hybrid electricity system can solve the problem of intermittency of solar. Such a hybrid electricity system is being implemented in a remote Indian unelectrified village for electricity access, livelihoods, and economic empowerment. In this paper, we report the technoeconomic feasibility and sustainability analysis of this hybrid system. The system consists of 30-kW solar photo voltaic (PV) and 20-kW biomass gasifier modules. Energy demand and resource availability are estimated with inputs from extensive stakeholder discussions and field surveys, and they account for daily and seasonal variations in both supply and end uses and availability and productive hours. The expected temporal electricity demand is estimated for households, community, irrigation, and commercial needs. The technoeconomic feasibility is assessed using hybrid optimization model for electric renewable energy (HOMER). Furthermore, opportunities for the development of productive uses and their expansion through a sustainable business model are explored. © 1963-2012 IEEE.","Electricity access; hybrid power systems; microgrid; rural areas; sustainable development","Agricultural wastes; Biomass; Developing countries; Electric power system economics; Energy management; Hybrid systems; Irrigation; Planning; Sustainable development; Electricity access; Hybrid power systems; Micro grid; Resource availability; Rural electrification; Stakeholder discussions; Sustainability analysis; Techno-economic feasibility; Rural areas","Balachandra, P.; Department of Management Studies, Centre for Sustainable Technologies, Indian Institute of ScienceIndia; email: patilb@iisc.ac.in",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",00189219,,IEEPA,,"English","Proc.

Many countries, including Australia, have had generous financial incentives in place to support households to adopt renewable energy technologies, such as rooftop photovoltaic solar panels. Given the increasing reductions in, and eventually a shift, from subsidies to market-based mechanisms the trend of new solar panel adoption is unclear. Solar power is a particularly relevant climate change mitigation technology in Australia given the country's high insolation rates. Australia has one of the highest rates of residential solar adoption in the world with 20% of households having solar panels. This study uses Australia as a case study because of the range of incentives available and the potential impacts of changes in incentive policies which are already under way. To determine preferences for changes in incentives and to predict consumer choices for adopting solar panels under future policy changes, a choice model was applied. Results showed that about two-thirds of the respondents would be willing to install a photovoltaic system. Installation costs had the greatest influence on choice of a photovoltaic system, followed by a 10-year and a 5-year guarantee of being able to sell excess solar power to retailers, and a high feed-in-tariff. Being able to access an interest free loan did not affect respondents' choices, and up-front rebates were preferred to be at least AUD 4000. Income, education, knowledge about Australia's renewable energy polices and believing in environmental benefits of solar energy all positively influenced the willingness to install a photovoltaic system while age had a negative effect. Preferences for financial incentives varied significantly across respondents. About a third of respondents were sufficiently sensitive to costs and incentives that a substantial cut in subsidies would probably dissuade them from installing a photovoltaic system. Younger people and those knowledgeable about renewable energy policies preferred low installation costs but were not motivated by incentives.

This paper presents a multi objective optimization using the Matlab GAtool. The algorithm is executed on a test system of 69 buses. The results of the case study show that proper positioning of renewable energy generators and sizing can lead to improvement in voltage profile, reduction in power losses and reduction in cost. Cost analysis of this framework is performed using Homer Pro3.8.1 which shows that this hybrid energy system is more efficient and economical than using of a single renewable electricity generator or combinations of renewable electricity generators of different sizes for a variable load profile.

Firstly, mathematical models that predicted the hourly power generation were developed for every microgrid component. Secondly, Artificial Neural Networks were utilized to predict hourly electricity demand and its results were validated with actual available data. Thirdly, through an electricity dispatch strategy and a Genetic Algorithm optimization technique, microgrid configurations were determined that had lowest levelized cost of energy, $/kWh. From peak power standpoint, four microgrid-conventional grid integration scenarios were examined, namely, microgrid possessing penetration level of 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%. Based on the environmental life cycle assessment of power generation, three carbon taxes were imposed -$12, $48, $72/tonne carbon dioxide emitted. Microgrid's electricity cost was found to be $0.43–0.86/kWh.

However, customers also need a comprehensive understanding of system design configuration and the related energy return from the system in order to support their PV investment. In this study, the rooftop PV systems from many high-volume installed PV systems countries and regions were collected to evaluate the lifetime energy yield of these systems based on machine learning techniques. Then, we obtained an association between the lifetime energy yield and technical configuration details of PV such as rated solar panel power, number of panels, rated inverter power, and number of inverters. Our findings reveal that the variability of PV lifetime energy is partly explained by the difference in PV system configuration. Indeed, our machine learning model can explain approximately 31% (95% confidence interval: 29-38%) of the variant energy efficiency of the PV system, given the configuration and components of the PV system.

However, the potential of a solar PV-system is location specific, influenced by the local solar resource, energy demand and cost among other factors. The main aim of this study is to conduct a detailed assessment of the potential of solar PV-systems in residential buildings in Lagos Metropolitan Area, Nigeria. Nigeria has enormous solar energy potential, it is the most populous country in Africa and occupies a significant place in the development of Africa. Yet, it is a country with one of the lowest per capita electricity consumption in the world – at 149 kWh per capita for a population of about 170 million, about 7% of Brazil's and 3% of South Africa's. To achieve this goal, this study employed the survey of 150 residential buildings in three local government areas (LGAs) in Lagos State, Nigeria to obtain electric load data. HOMER Pro was used to size the PV-systems and to determine the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE). The computed energy results of the study for the base case scenario revealed the PV array, lead acid battery and the converter (inverter) of the PV-systems to be in the following range: 0.3–76 kW; 2 to 176 kWh; and 0.1–13.2 kW respectively. Economic analysis revealed a LCOE of the systems in the range of 0.398 USD/kWh to 0.743 USD/kWh. The use of PV-system generated electricity in the dwellings has potential for an annual reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in the range of 31.24 kgCO2eq to 7456.44 kgCO2eq.

The aim of the study is therefore to identify the essential parameters of a sustainable expansion of renewable energies from the diversity of potential influencing factors and to illustrate them using a regional case study and GIS. The analyses reveal the great regional assertiveness of photovoltaics, whereby wind energy can assert itself due to social parameters also at some locations. Beyond this, it is to be stated that renewable energies find themselves in intense economic and social competition for space, although the most compatible spatial solutions have not always been able to prevail so far.

Driven by decreasing costs of energy storage, the focus of this paper is to investigate the feasibility of applying energy storage in the grid-connected PV system to mitigate its intermittency. Firstly, to appreciate the functionality of storage, a generic PV-battery-supercapacitor model was simulated in MATLAB/Simulink, and a flat load profile was obtained to enhance predictability from the network management point of view. However, the usage of supercapacitors at the residential level is limited, due to its high startup costs. Secondly, a detailed residential PV-battery model was implemented in the System Advisor Model (SAM) based on local data in Dubai. The optimal sizing of a battery system was determined by assessing two criteria: The number of excursions, and average target power, which are contradictory in optimization process. Statistical indicators show that a properly sized battery system can alleviate network fluctuations. The proposed sizing method can be also applied to other PV-storage systems. Finally, economic studies of PV-battery system demonstrated its competitiveness against standalone PV systems under appropriate tariff incentives. © 2019 by the author.","Battery; Hybrid energy storage; Optimal sizing; Penetration level; Photovoltaic (PV); System advisor model (SAM); Techno-economic analysis","Battery management systems; Digital storage; Electric batteries; Energy storage; Housing; Supercapacitor; Battery; Hybrid energy storage; Optimal sizing; Penetration level; Photovoltaic; System advisor model (SAM); Techno-Economic analysis; Economic analysis","Nour, M.; School of Engineering and Physical Sciences, Heriot-Watt UniversityUnited Kingdom; email: mutasim.nour@hw.ac.uk",,"MDPI AG",19961073,,,,"English","Energies",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85070675437

This paper presents a techno-economic and environmental analysis of different hybrid systems to supply electricity to a typical Iraqi rural village. The HOMER software is utilized for the optimization of the systems using the multi-year module, which has been overlooked in the literature thus far. The analysis shows that the PV/hydro/diesel/battery HES is the most economical option with a net present cost (NPC) of $113201, in addition to having acceptable technical and environmental performance levels. Throughout the project's 20 year lifetime, PV electricity production is reduced by 9.1% while diesel electricity production, CO2 emissions and served load are increased by 90.8%, 91.7% and 8.8%, respectively. The NPC for the multi-year module shows an increment of 22.5% in comparison with that of the single year module. Furthermore, the sensitivity analysis of some rarely reported parameters, such as water pipe losses, generator minimum load, battery roundtrip efficiency, battery setpoint state of charge, capacity shortage, PV capital cost multiplier and multi-year, demonstrated that variations in these parameters have significant effects on the system power flow and its economic analysis. © 2019","HOMER; Hybrid energy systems; Multi-year module; Net present cost; Off-grid; Sensitivity analysis","Charging (batteries); Cost benefit analysis; Cost effectiveness; Costs; Economic analysis; Electric load flow; Electric utilities; Environmental management; Hybrid systems; Rural areas; Secondary batteries; Water pipelines; HOMER; Hybrid energy system; Multi-year module; Net present cost; Off-grids; Sensitivity analysis; cost; electricity; electricity generation; energy; optimization; photovoltaic system; rural electrification; sensitivity analysis; software; Iraq","Tajuddin, M.F.N.; School of Electrical Systems Engineering, Universiti Malaysia PerlisMalaysia; email: faridun@unimap.edu.my",,"Elsevier Ltd",09601481,,,,"English","Renew.

Because deploying DG systems is associated with technical, financial, policy, and market implications that impact utilities, governments, and businesses, quantifying the potential of DG systems that could be deployed in a certain jurisdiction ex ante helps inform the decision-making process for all stakeholders. To that end, the upper limit of rooftop PV systems that could be deployed in Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia, was assessed with the aid of geographic information systems (GIS). By relying on urban land lot data for different categories, i.e., zones, and the maximum allowable area that could be built within a certain lot using prevailing building codes and regulations, the rooftop area suitable for PV deployment within Riyadh Metro was quantified. The analysis was restricted to rooftops in residential, mosque, shopping mall, and health care buildings only. Following the quantification of the rooftop area, the upper limit of rooftop solar PV capacity that can be deployed in the city of Riyadh was found to be 4.34 GW. This capacity represents nearly 22% of the peak load and can satisfy approximately 9% of the energy requirement in the central region, the region in which Riyadh resides. © 2019 by the authors.","Distributed generation; GIS; Land parcel; Rooftop solar; Saudi Arabia; Solar photovoltaics","decision making; future prospect; GIS; photovoltaic system; residential energy; solar power; stakeholder; urban area; Riyadh [Saudi Arabia]; Saudi Arabia","Elshurafa, A.M.; King Abdullah Petroleum Studies and Research Center (KAPSARC)Saudi Arabia; email: amro.elshurafa@kapsarc.org",,"MDPI AG",20711050,,,,"English","Sustainability",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85070785801

Pico hydropower is used as a distributed system based renewable energy system meant for rural or remote area load. It is, hence, of most significant to propose an effective methodology to assure the better making reimbursement of a combined Pico hydro system with solar pv system. The proposed method mainly estimates the feasible of installing Pico hydropower in a run-of river. The Methodologies to assess the feasibility and sustainability of such mechanism were depicted. The orderly designing of plant is defined by considering some optimal technological method that considers the dimension of components plus the estimation of the gross energy generation.

However current research tends to focus on a particular climate or location. This study analyzes four residences across four different climate zones in Arizona and explores the value of adding battery storage to a net-zero energy (NZE) photovoltaic (PV) system. Using the National Renewable Energy Lab's Building Optimization (BEopt) and System Advisor Model (SAM) tools, this study performs parametric analysis by varying battery size to determine a capacity that produces a maximum net present value (NPV). A sensitivity analysis on three possible future battery price trends is also performed. This study finds the NZE PV systems are only able to mitigate 37–44% of the peak electricity purchases and 4–12% of demand charges due to mismatch between solar potential and on-peak hours. Adding large batteries, 1.5–1.6 times larger than required to meet the annual peak energy purchase requirements, provides a maximum NPV for PV-battery systems at locations with favorable utility rates. We conclude that the best economics are achieved, at both current and expected future battery prices, when batteries are sized to never require replacement during the PV system lifetime. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Battery; BEopt; Energy storage; PV; SAM; TOU","Electric batteries; Electric energy storage; Energy storage; Energy utilization; Housing; Sales; Sensitivity analysis; Battery; BEopt; Parametric -analysis; Photovoltaic systems; Residential building; Residential customers; Residential energy; Simulation approach; Zero energy buildings; building; demand analysis; energy storage; energy use; fuel cell; numerical model; optimization; photovoltaic system; research work; residential energy; simulation; Arizona; United States; Nucleopolyhedrovirus","Tabares-Velasco, P.C.; Department of Mechanical Engineering, Colorado School of Mines, Brown Hall W470G, United States; email: tabares@mines.edu",,"Elsevier Ltd",09601481,,,,"English","Renew.

The objective of this paper is to analyse the role that Demand Response (DR) potentially can play in a cost-efficient development until 2050. The benefits of DR consist of integrating renewable source generation and reducing peak load consumption, leading to a reduction in generation, transmission, and storage capacity investments. The capabilities of DR are implemented in the European Model for Power Investments with high shares of Renewable Energy (EMPIRE), which is an electricity sector model for long-term capacity and transmission expansion. The model uses a multi-horizon stochastic approach including operational uncertainty with hourly resolution and multiple investment periods in the long-term. DR is modelled through several classes of shiftable and curtailable loads in residential, commercial, and industrial sectors, including flexibility periods, operational costs, losses, and endogenous DR investments, for 31 European countries. Results of the case study shows that DR capacity partially substitutes flexible supply-side capacity from peak gas plants and battery storage, through enabling more solar PV generation. A European DR capacity at 91 GW in 2050 reduces the peak plant capacities by 11% and storage capacity by 86%. © 2019 by the authors.","Demand Response; Demand-Side Management; Energy economics; European power system; Flexibility; Stochastic optimization","Demand side management; Economics; Electric utilities; Expansion; Gas plants; Optimization; Photovoltaic cells; Power markets; Solar power generation; Stochastic models; Demand response; Energy economics; European power system; Flexibility; Stochastic optimizations; Investments","Marañón-Ledesma, H.; Department of Industrial Economics and Technology Management, Norwegian University of Science and TechnologyNorway; email: hector.maranon-ledesma@ntnu.no",,"MDPI AG",19961073,,,,"English","Energies",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85073701815

In developing countries like Kenya with a high rate of urbanization, this transition requires urban and rural residents’ proactive responses to using renewable energy sources. In this regard, a better understanding of residents’ perceptions about renewable energy investment, RE sources availability, climate change, environmental conservation and other factors can lead to more efficient and sustainable implementation of renewable energy policies. This study investigates the role Kenya’s household energy consumers in urban and rural areas can play in adopting renewable energy technologies. To achieve this, a questionnaire survey was administered among 250 household consumers in Nairobi County, Makueni County, and Uasin Gishu County. Our survey analysis shows that about 84% of the respondents were interested in adopting renewable energy for their entire energy consumption mostly because of solving frequent power outages and high energy cost from the grid system. This perception did not have any correlations with income levels or any other socio-economic factors we identified. Furthermore, about 72% of the respondents showed their interests in producing and selling renewable energy to the national or local grids if government subsidies were readily available. Rural residents showed strong interests in adopting renewable energy technologies, especially solar PV solutions. However, the main impediment to their investment in renewable energy was the high cost of equipment (49%) and the intermittent nature of renewable energy (27%) resources. © 2019 by the authors.

In order to fill this gap, this study presents a multi-criteria approach for the selection of HRES for a typical low-income household. The analysis is based on two energy demand scenarios viz: consumer demand based on energy efficient equipment (EET) and consumer energy demand without energy efficiency. The optimization of the HRES is performed using hybrid optimization of multiple energy renewables (HOMER) while the multi-criteria analysis is carried out using Criteria Importance Through Intercriteria Correlation (CRITIC) and the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to the Ideal Solution (TOPSIS). Results show that the optimal HRES alternative returned based on both energy demand scenarios is a PV/GEN/BAT system. The analysis further shows that a reduction of 44.6% in energy demand through EET leads to: 51.38% decrease in total net present cost, 11.90% decrease in cost of energy, 96.61% decrease in CO2 emission and 193.94% increase in renewable fraction. Furthermore, the use of multi-criteria approach for HRES selection has an influence in the selection and ranking of the most suitable HRES alternatives. Overall, the application of EETs is environmentally and economically beneficial while the application of MCDM can help decision makers make a comprehensively informed decision on the selection of the most suitable HRES. © 2019 by the authors.","Energy efficiency; HOMER; Hybrid renewable energy system; Low-income household; TOPSIS","alternative energy; decision making; demand-side management; electronic equipment; energy efficiency; energy planning; low income housing; ranking; scenario analysis","Babatunde, O.M.; Department of Electrical Engineering, Tshwane University of TechnologySouth Africa; email: olubayobabatunde@gmail.com",,"MDPI AG",20711050,,,,"English","Sustainability",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85070755164

The lack of generation equipment maintenance, increasing load demand and lack of new generation stations has left the country with a shortage of electricity supply that leads to load shedding. As a result, alternative renewable energy is required to supplement the national grid. Photovoltaic (PV) solar generation and wind farms are leading in this regard. Sunlight fluctuates throughout the day, thereby causing irradiation which in turn causes the output of the PV plant to become unstable and unreliable. As a result, storage facilities are required to mitigate challenges that come with the integration of PV into the grid or the use of PV independently, off the grid. The same storage system can also be used to supplement the power supply at night time when there is no sunlight and/or during peak hours when the demand is high. Although storage facilities are already in existence, it is important to research their range, applications, highlight new technologies and identify the best economical solution based on present and future plans. The study investigated an improved economic and technical storage system for generation of clean energy systems using solar/PV plants as the base to supplement the grid. In addition, the research aims to provide utilities with the information required for making storage facilities available with an emphasis on capital cost, implementation, operation and maintenance costs. The study solution is expected to be economical and technically proficient in terms of PV output stabilization and provision of extra capacity during peak times. The research technology’s focus includes different storage batteries, pumped storage and other forms of storage such as supercapacitors. The analysis or simulations were carried out using current analytic methods and software, such as HOMER Pro®. The end results provide the power utility in South Africa and abroad with options for energy storage facilities that could stabilise output demand, increase generation capacity and provide backup power. Consumers would have access to power most of the time, thereby reducing generation constraints and eventually the monthly cost of electricity due to renewable energies’ accessibility. Increased access to electricity will contribute to socio-economic development in the country. The proposed solution is environmentally friendly and would alleviate the present crisis of load shedding due to the imbalance of high demand to lower generations. © 2019 by the authors.","Battery management system; Lithium-ion batteries; Pumped storage; Solar photovoltaic; State of charge; Storage; Storage operation and maintenance costs","Battery management systems; Charging (batteries); Costs; Economic analysis; Electric energy storage; Electric power plant loads; Electric power supplies to apparatus; Electric power transmission networks; Energy policy; Energy storage; Lithium-ion batteries; Maintenance; Solar power generation; Wind power; Application assessments; Electricity supply utility; Operation and maintenance; Pumped Storage; Socio-economic development; Solar photovoltaics; State of charge; Storage operations; Electric load shedding","Nko, M.; Department of Electrical Engineering, Tshwane University of TechnologySouth Africa; email: macdonaldnko@gmail.com",,"MDPI AG",19961073,,,,"English","Energies",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85073701118

First, this study introduces a DER management system in the residential building for participation to the day-ahead DR market. The distributed photovoltaic generation system (PV) and energy-storage system (ESS) are applied to reduce the electricity demand in the building and sell surplus energy on the grid. Among loads in the building, lighting (LTG) and heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) loads are included in the DR program. In addition, it is assumed that a power management system of an electric vehicle (EV) charging station is integrated the DER management system. In order to describe stochastic behavior of EV owners, the uncertainty of EV is formulated based on their arrival and departure scenarios. For measuring the economic efficiency of the proposed model, we compare it with the DER self-consuming operation model without DR participation. The problem is solved using mixed integer linear programming to minimize the operating cost. The results in summer and winter are analyzed to evaluate the proposed algorithm’s validity.

Finding an efficient framework that combines sustainable design, reliable operation and lifetime cost at minimal level is essential for society, customers and investors. In this regard, a novel multi-objective optimization model for the design of integrated energy system with electric, thermal and cooling subsystem is established to simultaneously minimize the economic, technical and environmental objectives. It aims to obtain the optimal sizing of each component such as photovoltaic panels, wind turbine, battery energy storage system, combined cooling, heating and power generation system, heat storage tank, gas boiler and electric chiller considering system performance in economics, system autonomy and carbon emissions. A hybrid energy system in residential area is taken as a case study to demonstrate the application of the proposed method, the Pareto front of the multi-objective problem is obtained via NSGA-II method, and four design plans on the Pareto front selected by Topsis method are analyzed and discussed. Such analysis show that the optimum solution could effectively reduce both the economic and environmental impacts of the integrated energy system as well as improve the system autonomy towards main grid.

HOMER is used to define the optimum sizing and techno-economic feasibility of the system equipment based on the geographical and meteorological data of the study region. In this study, different hybrid power systems are analyzed to select the optimum energy system while considering total net present cost (NPC) and levelized cost of energy (COE). The results showed that the optimal hybrid PV/battery system comprised 500 kW PV modules, 1200 7.6-kWh battery units, and 500 kW power converters. The proposed system has an initial cost of $6,670,000, an annual operating cost of $82,763/yr, a total NPC of $7,727,992, and a levelized COE of $1.536/kWh. While the PV/battery/FC power system is possible, the cost increases were due to the investment cost of the FC system. The optimal PV/battery/FC system has an initial cost of $6,763,000, an annual operating cost of $82,312/yr, a total NPC of $7,815,223, and a levelized COE of $1.553/kWh. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","electrolyzer; fuel cell; Hybrid power system; hydrogen; levelized cost of energy; solar energy; total net present cost","Economic analysis; Fuel cells; Hydrogen; Investments; Meteorology; Operating costs; Photovoltaic cells; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Annual operating costs; Economic feasibilities; Electrolyzers; Hybrid power systems; Levelized cost of energies; Net present cost; Techno-economic feasibility; Techno-economic studies; Electric power system economics","Li, C.; School of Electronic Engineering, Nanjing Xiaozhuang University, No.3601, Hongjing Road, China; email: chongli630@163.com",,"Taylor and Francis Inc.",15567036,,,,"English","Energy Sources Recovery Util.

Rural parts of many countries still do not have access to electricity or have electric power access to weak distribution grids with inadequate transmission and distribution system infrastructure. However, the countries where there is an abundance of solar radiation, a good potential of bio-degradable waste and average availability of wind source, access to electricity for those remote areas can be managed by distributed power generation. Considering the fact that the renewable energy sources (Solar, Wind etc.) are intermittent in nature, battery energy storage systems (BESS) and other reservoirs like biogas energy sources are the potential candidates to be integrated with the renewable sources to ensure continuous access to electricity and energy security. In this paper, a unique combination of Solar PV, Wind, Biomass and Vanadium Redox Flow Battery (VRFB) storage integrated hybrid Microgrid has been modeled and implemented practically for the first time. The capacity selection of different renewable sources for satisfying daily energy demand and their techno-commercial optimization has been performed through HOMER simulation. Further, the peak load shaving that is a limitation of HOMER model, has been established through PSCAD simulation by providing the real life data of different renewable sources, VRFB storage and the load profile as input to the model. The simulation model performances have been validated by a practical 10 kWP solar PV, 1 kW wind and 15 kVA Biogas generator integrated with 1 kW 6 h VRFB storage based Microgrid installed at India Institute of Engineering Science and Technology campus, India. In addition to these, zero loss of power supply probability (LPSP) has been ensured by implementing smart scheduling and controller considering the intermittency of the renewable sources.

The price of suitable batteries started to decline following the price trajectory of solar PV, the curtailment of solar feed-in-tariff in many countries and the increasing electricity price. These are some important factors for grid defection trends. In this paper, we analyse the reliability and levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) of residential off-grid customers’ PV-battery systems in order to carry out a techno-economic feasibility study of grid-defection. In more detail, this study demonstrates how off-grid customers can trade-off reliability for LCOE of their PV-battery systems, taking into consideration the priority/user-preference of different load types in a household. Consequently, we propose a novel decision making tool to improve the performance of a dynamic home energy management system (HEMS). The HEMS is set up as a mixed-integer linear optimization (MILP) problem which is solved using a rolling-horizon approach for weekly and yearly simulations. Weekly simulations were first performed in order to investigate the optimal range of PV and battery size combinations based on reliability and LCOE, using a week with the lowest solar PV output and the highest demand. Given the optimal PV-battery size combinations, yearly simulations were performed to assess the reliability and LCOE of PV-battery systems of randomly selected residential households in the Ausgrid Solar Home Electricity Data. Simulation results over the critical time period of the year indicate that an off-grid PV-battery system is relatively feasible for customers who are willing to compromize lower reliability in exchange for a lower cost. The result however indicates that the cost is still higher compared with a grid-connected system. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Battery storage; Grid-defection; Home energy management system; Mixed-integer linear programming; Off-grid PV-battery system; Rooftop photovoltaic","Battery storage; Decision making; Defects; Digital storage; Economic analysis; Economic and social effects; Electric batteries; Energy management; Housing; Integer programming; Power quality; Reliability; Sales; Battery systems; Grid-defection; Home energy management systems; Mixed integer linear programming; Photovoltaic; Energy management systems","Liu, H.; School of Electrical and Information Engineering, The University of SydneyAustralia; email: hliu7760@uni.sydney.edu.au",,"Elsevier Ltd",01420615,,IEPSD,,"English","Int J Electr Power Energy Syst",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85061814722

The increasing number of residential photovoltaic systems can be exploited by distribution network (DN) operators in order to support and improve the power quality of the grid without considerable further capital investment. The GSC can support the grid during abnormal conditions but may also be used to improve the DN power quality by balancing out asymmetries and alleviating the grid from undesired harmonics. The proposed advanced control technique demonstrates through simulation and experimental results that the role of GSC can be upgraded to improve the power quality of the grid. Furthermore, the proposed control scheme is validated on a realistic low-voltage DN using data from the Electricity Authority of Cyprus. Consequently, conventional practices by DN operators for improving the power quality can be reassessed as the necessary power electronics hardware for mitigating grid problems is already present within the GSCs of DG systems. © 1972-2012 IEEE.","Current controller; Distribution network (DN); Harmonic and asymmetry compensation; Power quality; Prosumers; Renewable energy systems; Rooftop photovoltaic (PV) systems","Antenna lobes; Distributed power generation; Electric power transmission networks; Investments; Photovoltaic cells; Power quality; Quality control; Renewable energy resources; Abnormal conditions; Current controller; Grid-side converter; Photovoltaic systems; Prosumers; Renewable energy systems; Residential photovoltaic; Technical and economic impacts; Electric power system control","Ali, Z.; Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering and Informatics, Frederick UniversityCyprus; email: zunaib.ali@stud.frederick.ac.cy",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",00939994,,ITIAC,,"English","IEEE Trans Ind Appl",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85068738359

The considered system concentrates on optimal sizing of an integrated renewable energy system (IRES) with grid provide a more continuous power supply with respect to the existing system. The different available sources Solar Photo Voltaic (SPV), Battery Energy Storage System (BESS), and a time constrained grid are considered in designing of the system. The system size optimization, sensitivity analysis and techno-economic viability has been done by using a standard software tool HOMER to fulfil the demand of the study area under consideration. A demand response strategy has been applied for the different load profiles. The configuration with the lowest Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE) and Total Net Present Cost (TNPC) with maximum value of renewable fraction (RF) has been considered as optimum. This ensures the minimization of the Carbon dioxide (CO2) emission. A comparative analysis has been presented showing the impact of the demand response on the LCOE and NPC as well as the system size. The economic analysis has been done according to four different cases obtained by varying the fraction (βNELS) of non-essential load shifting. It has been observed that the value of LCOE with the strategy of demand response and optimal resource management under which βNELS = 0.25 is reduced Rs. 11.23/kWh and Rs. 8.36/kWh with the grid tariff Rs.10/kWh and Rs.6/kWh respectively while the value of TNPC Rs. 1.99 × 107 and Rs. 1.48 × 107 respectively with the maximum renewable fraction of 31.06.

BIPVT system, consisting of flat-plate PVT solar collectors, is integrated in the south facing façade of a non-residential high-rise building. BIPVT collectors produce: i) thermal energy for space heating purposes, by a radiant floor system; ii) Domestic Hot Water (DHW); iii) electricity. Electric air-to-water heat pumps/chillers and a condensing gas fired boiler are used as auxiliary systems for space heating/cooling and DHW, respectively. In addition, the system also includes an electricity storage system coupled to the BIPVTs in order to mitigate the effects of solar energy intermittency and to obtain a virtually grid-independent system. In order to compare the proposed BIPVT system to a conventional building, a reference building model, i.e. without BIPVTs, energy storage and radiant floor, is considered. Here, the space heating and cooling energy is supplied by air-to-water heat pumps (one for each floor), DHW is produced by a condensing boiler and electricity is supplied by the national grid. The comparison is performed for three thermal zones, well representative of the thermal behaviour of the whole building. In this paper, a detailed dynamic simulation model is developed by means of well-known tool TRNSYS 17, in order to predict the transient behaviour of BIPVT system. Energy and exergy balances are taken into account to determine, for the 1-year operation, the exergy destructions and exergetic efficiencies of each of the investigated components. The economic viability of the proposed system is also discussed and the resulted Simple Pay Back period is about 4 years. From the carried out exergy analysis, the average exergetic efficiency of electricity storage system is about 90%, whereas the condensing boiler one is close to 2% all year long. In addition, an exergy analysis on the proposed BIPVT system located in several European weather zones is also carried out, as well as a suitable exergy analysis is performed by varying the capacity of the electricity storage system. Such analyses aim to assess the weather condition and the size of electricity storage effects on the destroyed exergy and exergetic efficiency of BIPVT collectors and electricity storage, respectively. It resulted that, the highest destroyed exergy of BIPVT occurs in Larnaca (150 MWh/year) vs the lowest one in Belfast (87 MWh/year), whereas the BIPVT collectors exergetic efficiencies range from 8.4% for Larnaca to 8.8% for Belfast. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","BIPVT; Building integrated solar thermal systems (BISTS); Dynamic simulation; Electricity energy storage; Exergetic analysis","Boilers; Collector efficiency; Computer simulation; Electric energy storage; Electric power transmission networks; Exergy; Floors; Heat pump systems; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Space heating; Tall buildings; Thermography (temperature measurement); Air-to-water heat pump; BIPVT; Building integrated photovoltaic thermal (BIPVT) systems; Electricity storage systems; Exergetic analysis; Solar thermal systems; Techno-Economic analysis; Thermo-economic modelling; Transient analysis; building; cooling; detection method; economic conditions; efficiency measurement; electricity; energy balance; energy efficiency; energy storage; equipment; exergy; heating; modeling; photovoltaic system; simulation; Europe","Vicidomini, M.; University of Naples Federico II, Department of Industrial Engineering, P.le Tecchio, 80, Italy; email: maria.vicidomini@unina.it",,"Elsevier Ltd",09601481,,,,"English","Renew.

In the meantime, reused batteries retired from electric vehicles provide another option for energy storage systems. In this paper, the economic performance evaluated by net present value of DSPV with reused batteries as energy storage systems (RBESS) is studied at the provincial level in China, so as to depict a comprehensive understanding of the current DSPV status and the development potential of RBESS in China. Instead of only focusing on the role of increasing the percentage of self-consumption (Model 1), a combined usage strategy of RBESS (Model 2) is also proposed. Moreover, the residual value of lithium-ion batteries is taken into consideration in this paper. Our results show that for the residential sector, only a small number of areas can benefit from RBESS under Model 2, while none can benefit under Model 1.

The appropriate sizes of system components are determined to meet the all-time load demand. A Techno-economic feasibility study was carried out in Homer Pro to determine the energy needs of the community and as well the system size and configuration that best suits the community. The energy requirement of the community was obtained to be 3.16MWh/day. The battery storage system was also sized in this work and a battery system capacity of 21,944Ah was able to meet the community energy requirement for up to a day without renewable energy supply. The dynamic model of proposed the microgrid was simulated in MATLAB/SIMULINK to observe the system's dynamic response in view of the power quality, load impact, and battery storage charging. The results obtained from the simulation depicted a stand-alone DC microgrid that is capable of meeting the daily electrical energy requirements of the system with good voltage stability.

This growth was enabled by the enactment of supporting policies: feed-in-tariff (FIT) and net-metering (NM), despite increasing criticism on the latter. This study addresses the terms, conditions and effectiveness of these policies reflected as the interannual growth in PV power production with respect to the potential realizable capacity in the country. Additionally, a life cycle cost and greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction analysis is presented to demonstrate the economic viability and environmental impact of implementing an on-grid residential PV installation in the country – in the context of these policies. Financial results showed that theoretical 100 kW-FIT/1.89 kW-NM PV projects were attractive and would lead to a GHG emission reduction of 102.9 tC0 2 e and 1.9 tC0 2 e, respectively. The FIT case had a Net Present Value (NPV) of PHP 4.7M (∼EUR 84k), a benefit-cost ratio of 4.17, and a simple payback period of 4.1 years. Net-metering had a positive NPV of PHP 27k (∼EUR 482), a benefit-cost ratio of 1.50, and a simple payback period of 7.8 years. The main profitability drivers were found to be the initial capital cost for FIT and the avoided retail electricity costs for NM. Project development can be further promoted by providing financial grants on top of FIT/NM and by modifying high-risk conditions such as FIT's “first-come-first-served” basis.

A hybrid system that integrates and optimizes across solar photovoltaic and complementary energy sources, such as wind and diesel generation, can improve reliability, and reduce the unit cost of power production. This study assesses the potential of a hybrid system to electrify a remote rural village in Ethiopia. The Hybrid Optimization of Multiple Electric Renewables model is used to assess primary data, develop a load profile and identify the optimal least-cost system option for the village. A sensitivity analysis was performed to determine the effect of variations in solar radiation, wind speed, and diesel price on optimal system configurations. The results show that a hybrid system with a combination of photovoltaic array, wind turbine, battery and diesel generator is the best option from an economic point of view. To meet the village's daily peak demand of 19.6 kW, energy generation cost is estimated at 0.207 dollars per kilowatt hour and net present cost at 82,734 dollars.

Furthermore, peer-to-peer microgrids are an essential ingredient of the swarm electrification approach, facilitating the modular growth of infrastructure for energy access in the developing world. However, peer-to-peer microgrids heavily rely on the initial and continuous participation of users, called prosumers. This work shows how prosumer participation can be achieved and how sustainable microgrid development can be ensured. We identify (a) motivational drivers for potential users to join the microgrid community, (b) measures that can stimulate such motivation, and (c) design criteria for these measures to ensure the sustainability of microgrid development. The results demonstrate that incentives for prosumer participation must extend beyond financial benefits and ensure community-wide access to asset creation. We undertake a bottom-up analysis, from the user perspective, to identify the critical factors for ensuring successful microgrid development. To this end, the analysis includes an exemplary on-site case study with users of solar home systems in Bangladesh. With over five million solar home systems, Bangladesh is the global leader in terms of the number of standalone energy systems installed, and other regions in the Global South are quickly catching up. The proposed measures assessed in this work seek a balance between the goal of increasing user value to encourage initial participation and the goal of sustainable microgrid development. Furthermore, practical experience from applying the proposed measures is discussed.

This paper presents a techno-economic analysis of off-grid PV LED road lighting systems for northern, central and southern regions of Turkey. Road lighting calculations are conducted using DIALux software for M4 and M5 road lighting classes to obtain optimal LED luminaires, pole sizes, and spacings. Among the obtained LED powers, load profiles are created using real lighting hours of operation of the selected regions. And then, the required PV-battery systems are optimized using HOMER software. Finally, sensitivity analysis is performed for future projections considering possible increases in electricity prices and decreases in component cost of the PV systems. The results showed that the levelized COE of the off-grid PV LED road lighting systems vary between 0.229 and 0.362 $/kWh for M4, and 0.254–0.359 $/kWh for M5 road lighting class, depending on the solar potential of the region. And, the total NPC of the entire lighting installation per km vary between 24296 and 29123 $ for M5, and 33225–44318 $ for M4 road lighting class. According to the results, the systems are infeasible under current conditions in Turkey. Nonetheless, they have the added benefits of contributing to the reduction of CO 2 emissions. Moreover, future projections show that the systems can be feasible if the declining trend in PV system costs continues and electricity prices increase. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","DIALux; HOMER; LED; Off-grid; Photovoltaic systems; Road lighting","Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Light emitting diodes; Lighting fixtures; Photovoltaic cells; Roads and streets; Sensitivity analysis; DIALux; HOMER; Off-grids; Photovoltaic systems; Road lighting; Economic analysis; cost analysis; electricity generation; electricity supply; future prospect; photovoltaic system; solar power; Turkey","Güler, Ö.; Istanbul Technical University, Energy Institute, Ayazaga CampusTurkey; email: onder.guler@itu.edu.tr",,"Elsevier Ltd",03601323,,BUEND,,"English","Build.

This paper presents the techno-economic analysis and optimum design of a HRES, as proposed to meet out the residential and agricultural electric load requirements of an energy poor community of Yamunanagar district in the State of Haryana, India. Three different optimal configurations, viz. wind/battery, PV/battery and wind/PV/battery are compared in respect of net present cost (NPC) and cost of energy (COE) to determine most economically viable option. For economic analysis and optimum sizing, all the necessary modelling and simulation is carried out using HOMER (Hybrid Optimization Model for Electric Renewable) software. From the simulation results, it is established that wind/PV/battery based HRES is the most cost-effective configuration for the specific location this investigation is about and also the optimum sizes of the different components are obtained. Further, for technical analysis, a MATLAB/Simulink model of the optimized system is built and its effectiveness is demonstrated in terms of maintaining active power balance between the different components of HRES as well as keeping DC link voltage (V DC ) and output AC voltage constant, irrespective of variations in solar irradiance, wind speed and connected load.

The deployment of the system is envisioned to acculturate the renewable technology into Indian society by field-on-laboratory demonstration (FOLD) and “bridge the gaps between research, development, and implementation.” The system consists of a solar photovoltaic (PV) (2.4 kWp), a wind turbine (3.2 kWp), and a battery bank (400 Ah). Initially, a prefeasibility study is conducted using the well-established HOMER (hybrid optimization model for electric renewable) software developed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), USA. The feasibility study indicates that the optimal capacity for the nano-grid system consists of a 2.16 kWp solar PV, a 3 kWp wind turbine, a 1.44 kW inverter, and a 24 kWh battery bank. The total net present cost (TNPC) and cost of energy (COE) of the system are US$20789.85 and US$0.673/kWh, respectively. However, the hybrid system consisting of a 2.4 kWp of solar PV, a 3.2 kWp of wind turbine, a 3 kVA of inverter, and a 400 Ah of battery bank has been installed due to unavailability of system components of desired values and to enhance the reliability of the system. The TNPC and COE of the system installed are found to be US$20073.63 and US$0.635/kWh, respectively and both costs are largely influenced by battery cost. Besides, this paper has illustrated the installation details of each component as well as of the system. Moreover, it has discussed the detailed cost breakup of the system. Furthermore, the performance of the system has been investigated and validated with the simulation results. It is observed that the power generated from the PV system is quite significant and is almost uniform over the year. Contrary to this, a trivial wind velocity prevails over the year apart from the month of April, May, and June, so does the power yield.

Underline that in the city of Lima grid-parity may not be achieved until 2027. In addition, companies selling PV energy within the homeowner facilities, despite resulting in LCOE values lower than the electricity tariffs, they may face non-profitable situations.

In fact, the results show that for an interest rate of 8% and a power price of 0.13 $/kW, it is recommended that a grid-connected wind energy system is the appropriate solution for the cities located in the west of Morocco, while the grid-connected photovoltaic (PV) system is recommended for the cities located in the east except in Zagora where it is suitable to adopt a HRES with PV and wind energy. Likewise, the obtained cost of electricity in the different cities is comparable to the national electricity price 0.1 $/kWh. © 2019, International Journal of Renewable Energy Research.","HOMER pro software; Hybrid energy system; On-grid; Optimization; Sensitivity; Solar; Wind",,"Ladide, S.BP 575 Boulevard Abdelkrim, Morocco; email: saad.ladide@gmail.com",,"International Journal of Renewable Energy Research",13090127,,,,"English","Int.

Basic economic theory involving the concepts of net present value, payback period, and internal rate of return was used, based on data from 2013 and 2016. The solar photovoltaic market is dependent on supporting policies and incentives. Thus, the relevant federal and provincial supporting policies for building implementation are briefly described and considered in the calculations. Results are presented in the form of summary tables showing selected major cities, classified into different categories, in terms of financial viability. The results show that in 2013 there were 9 cities out of 13 for which the payback period was expected to be higher than 30 years but in 2016, only Montreal PV projects remain infeasible. Furthermore, sensitivity analyses were conducted to establish new values for the selling price of electricity, initial cost of the proposed project, and percentage of subsidy required to ensure project attractiveness, that is, a short payback period of only 5 years for residential buildings. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Canada; Comparative analysis; Computational economics and engineering; Economic analysis; Residential solar photovoltaic; Supporting policies","Computation theory; Earnings; Housing; Investments; Photovoltaic cells; Sensitivity analysis; Solar concentrators; Solar power generation; Canada; Comparative analysis; Computational economics; Solar photovoltaics; Supporting policies; Economic analysis; comparative study; economic analysis; electricity generation; energy market; energy policy; photovoltaic system; solar power; Canada","Rousse, D.R.; t3e Research Group, Department of Mechanical Engineering, École de Technologie Supérieure, 1100 Notre-Dame Street West, Canada; email: daniel.rousse@etsmtl.ca",,"Elsevier Ltd",22131388,,,,"English","Sustainable Energy Technol.

The results of a suitable experimental campaign are also presented for different commercial FPCs system layouts. The developed Type 99 is successfully validated, proven by the very good agreement achieved between the simulation and experimental results. By the new Type 99 a suitable Design of Experiment (DoE) analysis is carried out with the aim to assess the design and operating parameters mostly affecting the energy and economic performance of two types of FPCs. Specifically, collector pipe diameters, slope, storage tank volume, and thermal insulation thickness are investigated. The analysis is carried out for three case studies which refer to residential Domestic Hot Water (DHW) production applications and to three different European weather zones (Freiburg, Naples and Larnaca). For these case studies an optimization procedure is also carried out by varying the same design and operating parameters for two different objective functions: best energy behaviour [maximum Primary Energy Saving (PES)] and best economic performance [minimum Simple Pay Back (SPB)].

The data was gathered by a questionnaire survey from 406 households in Hyogo Prefecture, Japan, which received eco-home diagnosis in the past three years. The result confirms that around 40% of the samples installed home energy management system (HEMS) as the visualisation tool, and many households received low-carbon subsidies; however, few of them have utilised the low-interest loan from the government of Hyogo. Household lifestyle efforts are less associated with the policy measures and some differ due to family characteristics, i.e., the age of head of the household. Replacing household equipment with low-carbon items is largely determined by the visualisation approach and availability of economic incentives. As an example, the installation of HEMS would increase the probability of replacement with an electric heat pump water heater by 25.6% and the introduction of solar PV system by 55.9%.

For plug-in electric vehicles, direct-current fast charging (DCFC) is proposed as a solution to support long-distance travel and relieve range anxiety. However, DCFC has also been shown to be potentially more expensive compared to residential or workplace charging. In particular, electricity demand charges can significantly impact electricity cost for fast charging applications. Here we explore technological solutions that can help reduce the electricity cost for electric vehicle fast charging. In particular, we consider thousands of electricity rates available in the United States and real-world vehicle charging load scenarios to assess opportunities to reduce the cost of DCFC by deploying solar photovoltaics (PV) panels and energy storage (battery), and implementing a co-location configuration where a DCFC station is connected to an existing meter within a commercial building. Results show that while the median electricity cost across more than 7000 commercial retail rates remains less than $0.20/kWh for all charging load scenarios considered, cost varies greatly, and some locations do experience significantly higher electricity cost. Co-location is almost always economically viable to mitigate fixed cost and demand charges, but the relative benefit of co-locating diminishes as station size and utilization increase. Energy storage alone can help mitigate demand charges and is more effective at reducing costs for “peaky” or low-utilization loads. On the other hand, PV systems primarily help mitigate energy charges, and are more effective for loads that are more correlated with solar production, even in areas with lower solar resource. PV and energy storage can deploy synergistically to provide cost reductions for DCFC, leveraging their ability to mitigate demand and energy charges. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","DC fast charging; Distributed energy; Electric vehicles; Electricity rates; Retail rates","Commercial vehicles; Cost reduction; Electric energy storage; Electric vehicles; Location; Office buildings; Plug-in electric vehicles; Solar power generation; Alternative fuel vehicles; Commercial building; DC fast charging; Distributed energies; Economically viable; Electricity demands; Technological solution; Technology solutions; Charging (batteries); alternative fuel; cost analysis; electric vehicle; electricity; energy resource; energy storage; photovoltaic system; solar power; technological change; workplace; United States","Muratori, M.; National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), 15013 Denver West Parkway, United States; email: matteo.muratori@nrel.gov",,"Elsevier Ltd",03062619,,APEND,,"English","Appl.

However, their higher costs compared to gas-fuelled cars are still a barrier for their large diffusions. One possible solutions to increase EVs penetration is their use as storage within households equipped with Renewable Energy Sources enabling a flexible energy management, for instance by the Vehicle-to-Grid and/or Vehicle-to-Home scheme. The aim of this paper is to investigate possible management of the EV battery through an optimization approach capable to minimize the electricity supply costs for an Italian residential end-user with PV, considering battery constraints, such as driving habits. A statistical approach of driver behavior is integrated within the optimization approach to define some possible daily driving patterns. The optimization takes into consideration mobility needs, prices for selling and purchasing electricity and hourly electrical, heating and cooling load profiles of the household. On the basis of these constraints the optimizer identifies when PV overproduction can be either used to charge batteries or to partially cover the load demand of the household.

Typically, the electrical energy needs are satisfied by photovoltaic plants (PV)s, while the thermal energy needs are satisfied by solar thermal plants (ST)s. However, there is the possibility to produce simultaneously electrical and thermal energy by hybrid photovoltaic/thermal (PV/T) plants. This study presents the comparison of the performances of a hybrid photovoltaic/thermal (PV/T) plant with those of a systems made by a PV plant plus a ST plant (PV + ST). Such comparisons are interesting in those buildings where there is not enough available surface for installing both PV and ST plants as much as necessary for satisfying the energy needs of such buildings (e.g. in residential tower buildings). This research is carried out having as target a residential unit situated in different geographic areas: Catania (IT), Split (HR) and Freiburg (D). The outcomes of the energy analysis, calculated following the first and the second thermodynamic law approach, highlight that a PV/T plant produces more energy than a conventional solar system (PV-ST) in the three cities. Otherwise, the results of the economic analysis show that the PV plants allow to achieve the most economic benefits due to the cheaper cost of this technology. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Economic analysis; Hybrid PV/T plant; Quality of energy; Renewable energy; Solar energy; TRNSYS simulation","Economic analysis; Energy management; Housing; Quality control; Solar energy; Thermal energy; Comparative assessment; Hybrid PV/T plant; PhotoVoltaic plant; Photovoltaic/thermal; Quality of energies; Renewable energies; Solar thermal plants; Trnsys simulations; Solar power generation","Gagliano, A.; DIEEI- Department of Electric, Electronics and Computer Engineering, University of Catania, Viale A.

The case studies were carried out for two house types with different sizes and construction materials, under two typical occupancy patterns (occupied full day and evening only), in seven cities chosen to be representative of a broad range of climates. The study examined three operational scenarios: off-grid operation using PV and batteries; off-grid operation with PV, battery and petrol generator; and grid-connected net zero energy operation. Results show that for the houses being powered by electricity only in warm and moderate climates, large PV battery systems are required to achieve off-grid housing using PV and batteries only, and that payback periods are longer than 15.8 years under current and projected future climates considering replacement cost of battery storage, and projected inflation, discount rate and electricity price escalation rate. Off-grid operation with PV and batteries is economically unviable in heating dominated regions. The study shows that when a PV battery system is hybridized with an on-site petrol generator, the payback periods can be reduced significantly, and it may become economically feasible to operate off-grid with PV, battery and generator for both house types under most occupancy scenarios in moderate and warmer climates, but may still not be economically viable in colder climates. The case study also demonstrates that a grid-connected net zero energy home is economically feasible for all seven cities studied, and more economically attractive than a fully off-grid house under both current and projected future climates, even without subsidies for solar feed-in tariffs. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Future global warming climate; Off-grid housing; PV battery system; Residential building simulation","Building materials; Economic analysis; Electric batteries; Gasoline; Global warming; Heating; Houses; Investments; Battery systems; Building simulation; Economically viable; Electricity prices; Off-grids; Operational scenario; Residential building; Warming climate; Electric power transmission networks; building; discount rate; energy market; feasibility study; global warming; housing; photovoltaic system; residential energy; simulation; smart grid","Ren, Z.; CSIRO Land and Water, Private Bag 10, Australia; email: zhengen.ren@csiro.au",,"Elsevier Ltd",03062619,,APEND,,"English","Appl.

The consumers are categorized based on their lifestyles. It is found that lower the size of the panel, lower is the savings leading to a decrease in the attractiveness of a rooftop PV system for a residential consumer. Also, the compensation mechanism and injection tariff play a crucial role in making a rooftop PV system feasible for a residential consumer. It is observed that the achieved savings of a consumer is a function of compensation mechanism and seasonal load pattern of a consumer. A shared distributed net metering model is proposed as an alternative to the individual rooftop PV systems, to mitigate the issues related to shading, land and financial feasibility of a PV system for small residential consumers. The results of the simulation analysis based on the model indicate a high positive net present value and an acceptable payback period, which makes the model feasible.

Nine hybrid systems were considered in this study based on the following components: PV module, wind turbine, micro-hydro turbine, diesel generator, battery, charge controllers, and inverters. Two energy sources and storage battery characterized each system. The PV/diesel/small hydro/battery was found to be the most viable economic system for Southern Cameroons with a 0.443$/kWh energy cost.

This deployment has proven to be a key way to mitigate the risks of catastrophic climate change. However, existing retail electricity arrangements can create mixed incentives for households contemplating investing in both PV and EE. This is caused by net metering arrangements that value self-consumption of PV generation far more than PV exports to the grid. This means that falling household demand due to EE may significantly reduce the financial value of PV. Meanwhile, the continuous cost decline of battery storage systems (BS) has encouraged more PV owners to consider storing PV exports to maximise self-consumption. However, there has been little research on whether the addition of BS could reduce barriers to the combined uptake of PV and EE. In this paper, real PV generation and electricity consumption data is used from numerous households in Sydney (Australia), together with a battery cyclelife model, to assess the financial outcomes of combining PV, EE and BS. The results indicate that EE can reduce PV system revenue, that adding BS to a combination of PV and EE generally increases PV revenue, that BS costs are still high for this residential application, and that the uptake of EE can result in deeper BS cycling which reduces the battery lifetime. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Batteries; Distributed energy; Energy policy; Net metering; Tariffs","Climate change; Digital storage; Energy efficiency; Energy policy; Finance; Housing; Photovoltaic cells; Secondary batteries; Solar cells; Battery storage system; Distributed energies; Electricity-consumption; Financial values; Net metering; Photovoltaic systems; Residential application; Tariffs; Battery storage","Oliva H., S.; Universidad Tecnológica Metropolitana, Departamento de ElectricidadChile; email: soliva@utem.cl",,"Elsevier Ltd",13640321,,RSERF,,"English","Renewable Sustainable Energy Rev",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85060981625

A typical Nigerian rural community – Lade II in Kwara State was used as a case study where the energy demand for the residential and commercial loads was 2.5MWh/day and 171kWh/day respectively. The optimized HMS results from HOMER comprising of a solar photovoltaic (PV) array (1.5MW), diesel generators (350kW) and battery storage (1200 units) has a combined least net present cost of $4,909,206 and a levelized electricity tariff of $0.396 per kWh. Contrasting the HMS with a diesel-only system for the community, an approximate 97% reduction in all pollutant emissions was observed. Furthermore, fluctuations in diesel fuel prices, variations in average solar insolation, and variations in the solar PV's capital/replacement costs were utilized in conducting a sensitivity analysis for the HMS. The capacity outage probability table (COPT) was utilized in validating the reliability of the simulation results obtained from HOMER. The HMS was observed to experience a load loss of 0.769MW, 0.594MW &amp; 0.419MW when zero, one and two diesel generator(s) respectively were operational for all of the Solar PV's and Batteries being off-line. The loss of load probability (LOLP), loss of load expectation (LOLE), and total expected load loss (ELL) obtained from the COPT were 5.76 × 10 −8 , 5.0457 × 10 −4 hr/yr and 0.025344Watt respectively.

Without energy sources, it is impossible for any country to produce, transport and transform products for general human activities. Togo, a country of West Africa, is a net importer of petroleum products and produces only 40% of its electrical energy requirements. At the level of rural electrification, the rate of access to electricity is 6.3% in 2016. Although Togo is a country with a high potential for bioenergy and solar energy production. Hybrid photovoltaic/biodiesel systems (PV/BG) could therefore contribute to reducing the country's energy dependence and increasing the rate of access to electricity in rural areas while reducing greenhouse gas emissions. This research presents the economic viability of a hybrid system (PV/BG from Jatropha Curcas) for the electrification of a village in the central region of northern Togo. The main objective of this research is to propose a model of electric energy production system in rural areas from renewable sources at a low operating cost while ensuring positive socio-economic impacts for the inhabitants of the environment. The analysis and optimization of the techno-economic performance of the proposed hybrid system is done using the hybrid optimization model for electric renewable (HOMER). The simulations has been carried out under various climate conditions and fuel price used as sensitivity variables. This research has proven that despite the high cost of biodiesel produced from Jatropha Curcas (1.6 USD/ litter) the hybrid (PV/biodiesel) system proposed for the production of electric energy in rural Togo is very economical. The electricity produced by the proposed system under various climate condition is always less than 0.21 USD/kWh with a capacity shortage of about 0.0999%, economical than the electricity produced by the largest thermal power plant of the country (ContourGlobal) which electricity costs 0.3 USD/kWh. The results shows that the proposed system can contribute in a sustainable way to the improvement of the economic and social conditions of the inhabitants of rural areas. © BEIESP.","Biodiesel; HOMER; Hybrid system; Jatropha curcas",,,,"Blue Eyes Intelligence Engineering and Sciences Publication",22773878,,,,"English","Int.

Previous analysis of the implications of these residential distributed energy resources (DERs) has tended to focus on the individual private benefits to households that deploy them, their direct technical and revenue impacts on network businesses, or broader electricity industry implications. This paper seeks to quantify the economic impacts of residential PV and BES on electricity network businesses, from residential to wholesale market region level. One key impact is reductions in network business revenues as households purchase less electricity from the grid. However, we also consider the potential savings for network businesses as these PV and BES deployments reduce peak network demand from residential to wholesale market level, a key driver of network investment and hence network business costs. Our findings for the Sydney region suggest that potential network investment cost reductions could even outweigh the loss of revenue.

In all three domains the chosen literature employ a wide variety of quantitative analyses such as discrete choice models ranging from multinomial logit models and principal component analysis to qualitative assessment of the answers through inductive analysis. The explanatory variables are categorized in six superordinate explanatory variable categories of economic factors, environmental factors, personal preferences and values, social factors, household characteristics and market and policy factors. In total we identify 31 explanatory variables which have been investigated in the 38 articles chosen, falling under the six categories. Investment cost is an important explanatory variable for all three domains, but a policy variable such as government subsidy could mitigate the former explanatory variable.

As the prosumers are equipped with smart appliances, photovoltaic panels, and battery energy storage systems, they take advantage of their consumption, generation, and storage flexibilities to exchange energy with neighboring prosumers through negotiating on the amount of energy and its price with an aggregator. The proposed framework comprises two separate multi-objective mixed integer nonlinear programming optimization models for prosumers and the aggregator. Prosumers' objective is to maximize the comfort level and minimize the electricity cost at each instant of time, while aggregator intends to maximize its profit and minimize the grid burden by matching prosumers' supply and demand. The evolutionary nondominated sorting genetic algorithm-III (NSGA-III) is employed to generate a set of feasible nondominated solutions to the optimization problem of each individual prosumer and the aggregator. As a bilateral negotiation between each prosumer and the aggregator results in significant computational and communication overhead, a virtual power plant is introduced as an intermediator on behalf of all prosumers to proceed the negotiation with the aggregator in a privacy-preserving noncooperative environment, where no private information is shared. Hence, an automated negotiation approach is embedded in the framework, which enables the negotiators to reactively negotiate on concurrent power and price using private utility functions and preferences. To converge to an acceptable agreement, the negotiation approach follows an alternating-offer production protocol and a reactive utility value concession strategy. The effectiveness of the framework is evaluated by several economic and environmental assessment metrics through a variety of numerical simulations. © 2005-2012 IEEE.","Distributed coordination; energy negotiation; multi-objective optimization; pricing; prosumers; smart grid","Cooperative communication; Costs; Data privacy; Economics; Electric energy storage; Electric load management; Electric power transmission networks; Genetic algorithms; Integer programming; Job shop scheduling; Multiobjective optimization; Nonlinear programming; Optimization; Photovoltaic cells; Scheduling; Distributed coordination; energy negotiation; Indexes; Informatics; Load modeling; Prosumers; Smart grid; Smart power grids","Azar, A.G.; Department of Engineering, Aarhus UniversityDenmark; email: agaz@dtu.dk",,"IEEE Computer Society",15513203,,,,"English","IEEE Trans.

Alternative energy solutions are promising and favorable for small island purposes as they can be used in small-scale applications. In Colombia, most of the island territories lack energy access, and specific solutions need to be implemented for electricity supply. The Corales del Rosario Archipelago (Colombian Caribe) is a National Park of ecological importance due to its biodiversity and coral reef formation. It consists of 27 islands, from which Isla Grande is the larger one, and concentrates the human settlements (such as the Orika village, with about 500 inhabitants) and touristic activities. In this paper, we explore the energy situation and renewable energy potential in small non-interconnected islands around the world, to later focus on Colombian non-interconnected islands. As a case study, we evaluate the energetic situation in Isla Grande, and propose how renewable energy solutions could be implemented in the island. Primary and secondary information were collected from surveys with the local community, and supported by bibliography, and include information regarding energy demand and supply, hydrology (wave, tidal and sediment transport regimes) and meteorology conditions that could influence renewable energy resources (wind and solar radiation). Land coverage maps were constructed from satellite images, and used to delimitate shadow and no-shadow regions. A typical local house was selected for the energy demand calculations (8.05 kWh/day) and to propose renewable energy solutions. The hydrology analysis confirms no potential for wave and tidal energy solutions, while wind speed regimes are also not favorable for wind power implementation. Solar photovoltaic energy is, however, a promising solution for this island, where some individuals already have solar systems for self-consumption, while others use diesel generators. Individual home solutions should require about 11.6 m2 photovoltaic panels, while a system that could provide electricity to the whole community should require about 1590 m2. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Corales del Rosario Archipelago; Island electrification; Non-interconnected areas; Renewable energies","Biodiversity; Energy management; Energy policy; Hydrology; Landforms; Photovoltaic cells; Sediment transport; Solar power generation; Wind effects; Wind power; Alternative energy solutions; Corales del Rosario Archipelago; Economic and social development; Island electrification; Non-interconnected areas; Renewable energies; Renewable energy potentials; Solar photovoltaic energies; Tidal power; alternative energy; archipelago; biodiversity; coral reef; electricity supply; electrification; energy resource; human settlement; island; satellite imagery; sediment transport; wind power; wind velocity; Colombia; Colon [Panama]; Isla Grande; Panama [Central America]; Anthozoa","Pasqualino, J.; Fundación Universitaria Tecnológico Comfenalco, Sede A Barrio España Cr 44 D N° 30A - 91, Colombia; email: jorgelina.pasqualino@gmail.com",,"Elsevier B.V.",09258574,,ECENE,,"English","Ecol.

The selected renewable systems exhibit size scalability (i.e., photovoltaics can vary from small to large scale applications) and can easily fit to residential applications (i.e., solar thermal systems). Various technical variations were considered for each of the studied technologies. The environmental implications were assessed through detailed life cycle assessment (LCA), implemented from raw material extraction through manufacture, use, and end of life of the selected energy systems. The methodological order followed comprises two steps: i. LCA and uncertainty analysis (conducted via SimaPro), and ii. techno-economic assessment (conducted via RETScreen). All studied technologies exhibit environmental impacts during their production phase and through their operation they manage to mitigate significant amounts of emitted greenhouse gases due to the avoided use of fossil fuels. The life cycle carbon footprint was calculated for the studied solar systems and was compared to other energy production technologies (either renewables or fossil-fuel based) and the results fall within the range defined by the global literature. The study showed that the implementation of photovoltaics and solar thermal projects in areas with high average insolation (i.e., Crete, Southern Greece) can be financially viable even in the case of low feed-in-tariffs.

In EU, many islands have become sites of energy innovation, where betting on Renewable Energy Sources is a winning choice to meet their energy needs. In this framework, renewable energies play a key role for supporting the transition of small islands to an autonomous, cleaner and low-carbon energy system – in line with the overall EU Energy Union package and EU2030 goals. This study examines the suitability of using hybrid energy system comprising photovoltaic systems, wind turbines, biomass and diesel generators to meet the electricity demand of Favignana Island, to increase the penetration of renewables in the local electricity grid. Additionally, the energy scenarios simulation aimed at identifying foreseeable energy-environmentally improvements associated to the mutual merging of further energy sectors, such as transportation and heating sector. Consequently, the renewable capacity firming issues can be strongly mitigated by integrating new energy demand components. Thus, this work shows in a systemic overview all the outcomes related to the different energy mix layout, with varying the RES share values compatibly with the local grid electrotechnical constraints.

Electrical energy required to run these units plays a major role in it. In the present work, feasibility of penetrating biomass renewable energy in power supply system of a cement manufacturing plant in India has been analysed. For this, three hybrid systems, i.e. biomass–grid, PV–biomass–grid and PV–biomass–battery, have been modelled and simulated using HOMER tool for supplying power to selected plant loads presently run by state grid. Lowest cost of energy (COE), net present cost (NPC) and pollutant emissions were taken as the criteria of selecting feasible system configuration. It was found that biomass–grid system has lowest COE and NPC of $0.0694/kWh and $10,597,290, respectively, but the system comprising PV–biomass–battery emits lowest pollutants at highest COE and NPC. Implementation of biomass–grid system ensures annual saving of $184,736.3 with capital cost payback period of 4.84 years along with reduction of pollutant emissions by 88.22% as against present scenario of only-grid supply system.

Thirty generic urban block cases in six typologies that represent a diverse range of urban forms were examined through simulation-based studies under the same planning conditions and simulation assumptions so as to rule out the impact of non-design related factors. Several key planning and geometric parameters which capture the formal characteristics of the urban blocks were examined as independent variables, and the dependent variables include the performance indicators on solar energy harvesting potential and building net energy use intensity that capture the dual benefits of photovoltaic (PV) systems in reducing building cooling loads and offsetting local plug loads with electricity generated on site. The results indicate that, under the same planning conditions and design premises, differences in urban block typology could lead to up to 200% increase in solar energy harvesting potential and electricity generated from rooftop PV, twelve times higher rate of reduction in building cooling loads, tow times higher rate of reduction in net purchased electricity, and 25% lower building net energy use intensity. The courtyard and hybrid urban block typologies consistently outperform the other typologies, especially the commonly implemented tower and slab blocks, and they benefit the most from PV deployment in the tropics. The comparison between an existing residential precinct and a hypothetical alternative hybrid urban block further demonstrated the significant impact of urban design on efficiency of PV electricity generation and building energy use efficiency. In addition to the significant economic benefit in reduction in utility cost and environmental implication in terms of equivalent reduction in CO2 emissions on urban scale, this study highlights the crucial role that urban design plays in terms of maximising on-site renewable energy production such as solar energy. The significant planning and geometric parameters in relation to the performance indicators provide insight as reference for establishing solar energy friendly urban planning and architectural design guidelines. The methodology and technical workflow as developed can support reliable and efficient feasibility studies, especially in the early stage of urban planning and architectural design. Integrated with other performance evaluations, they can facilitate decision-making on implementation of renewable energy integrated green building technologies and passive design strategies. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Building energy use efficiency; Photovoltaic (PV) system; Renewable energy application; Solar energy; Urban block typology; Urban form","Air conditioning; Architectural design; Benchmarking; Cooling systems; Decision making; Electric power generation; Energy efficiency; Energy harvesting; Energy utilization; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Tropics; Building energy use; Photovoltaic systems; Renewable energy applications; Urban blocks; Urban form; Urban growth; alternative energy; architectural design; building; cooling; economic conditions; electricity generation; energy efficiency; energy use; photovoltaic system; solar power; strategic approach; typology; urban area; urban design; urban planning; Singapore [Southeast Asia]","Zhang, J.; Solar Energy Research Institute of Singapore (SERIS), National University of SingaporeSingapore; email: ji.zhang@nus.edu.sg",,"Elsevier Ltd",03062619,,APEND,,"English","Appl.

Model predictive control algorithms manage the energy system by nonlinear global optimization. Within this optimization, a time-varying state space model, which is derived from the energy system simulation model, reflects the system dynamics. Owing to the resulting high complexity, two algorithms for distributed model predictive control are developed. In addition, the developed approaches are compared to a common reference control concept as well as centralized model predictive control. For the comparison of annual operational costs, current German energy prices and subsidies are implemented into the economic calculation. Results show an improved performance of the developed approaches with 11.6% cost reduction in comparison to the reference. This is achieved through an increase of the heat pump seasonal performance factor by 3.4%, reduced curtailment of electrical photovoltaic energy to 21.5% of the reference value and prevention of auxiliary heater operation. Furthermore, increased photovoltaic self-consumption by the heat pump results in a slight reduction of battery storage operation. In conjunction with monetary and energetic advantages, model predictive control increases the comfort in regards to the violation of minimum limits for the comfort criteria. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Battery storage; Building climate control; Domestic hot water; Heat pump; Model predictive control (MPC); Thermal energy storage","Battery storage; Climate control; Climate models; Computational complexity; Cost reduction; Economics; Electric batteries; Global optimization; Heat pump systems; Heat storage; Hot water distribution systems; Housing; Photovoltaic cells; Predictive control systems; Pumps; Solar energy; Space power generation; State space methods; Thermal energy; Thermography (temperature measurement); Water; Battery energy storage systems; Building climate controls; Distributed Model predictive Control; Domestic hot water; Heat pumps; Nonlinear global optimization; Residential building energies; Time-varying state space modeling; Model predictive control; algorithm; building; energy storage; numerical model; optimization; performance assessment; photovoltaic system; power generation; residential location","Kuboth, S.; Chair of Engineering Thermodynamics and Transport Processes (LTTT), Center of Energy Technology (ZET), University of BayreuthGermany; email: sebastian.kuboth@uni-bayreuth.de",,"Elsevier Ltd",03062619,,APEND,,"English","Appl.

With the rapid growth of the distributed PV installed capacity, the problems of PV grid connection and PV consumption are becoming more and more serious in China. It is an effective means to improve the efficiency of PV system by promoting the home self-consumption of PV generation. In this study, a residential demand response model considering distributed PV consumption based on dynamic electricity price is proposed. The household users are classified into several types with different power consumption preferences in this model. Both the comfort and economy of power consumption are quantified to describe the users’ satisfaction. The model is established with two goals, maximizing the users’ satisfaction meanwhile minimizing PV power into the grid. Then a solution algorithm based on NSGA-II is proposed to solve the model. Finally, an example study based on China's PV policy is presented, and the results show that the model has certain advantages in improving the users’ satisfaction and increasing the rate of self-consumption of PV generation. In addition, sensitivity analysis of the provincial government's PV subsidies in China is also carried out and the relevant policy recommendations are presented. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Demand response; Distributed PV; NSGA-II; Power consumption preference; PV subsidies; Self-consumption","Electric power utilization; Photovoltaic cells; Sensitivity analysis; Demand response; Distributed PV; NSGA-II; PV subsidies; Self-consumption; Housing; algorithm; demand analysis; energy efficiency; energy policy; energy use; model; photovoltaic system; residential energy; subsidy system; China","Lu, Q.; College of Economics and Management, Shanghai University of Electricity PowerChina; email: luq1982@126.com",,"Elsevier Ltd",03605442,,ENEYD,,"English","Energy",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85061345188

It is estimated that between 2000 and 2017 the power consumption has increased from 120 to 315 TWh. The building sector has an important role in this respect as it accounts for around 80 percent of the total electricity consumption. The situation is imposing significant energy, environmental and economic challenges for the country. To tackle these problems and curtail its dependence on oil-based energy infrastructure, KSA is aiming to develop 9.5 GW of renewable energy projects by 2030. The campus of the King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals (KFUPM) has been considered as a case study. In the wake of recently announced net-metering policy, the purpose of this paper is to investigate the prospects of rooftop application of PV in buildings. ArcGIS and PVsyst software have been used to determine the rooftop area and undertake PV system modeling respectively. Performance of PV system has been investigated for both horizontal and tilted installations. The study also investigates the economic feasibility of the PV application with the help of various economic parameters such as benefit cost ratio, simple payback period (SPP) and equity payback periods. An environmental analysis has also been carried out with the help of RETScreen software to determine the savings in greenhouse gas emissions as a result of PV system. Design/methodology/approach: This study examines the buildings of the university campus for utilizable rooftop areas for PV application. Various types of structural, architectural and utilities-related features affecting the use of building roofs for PV have been investigated to determine the corrected area. To optimize the performance of the PV system as well as space utilization, modeling has been carried out for both horizontal and tilted applications of panels. Detailed economic and environmental assessments of the rooftop PV systems have also been investigated in detail. Modern software tools such as PVsyst, ArcGIS and RETScreen have also been used for system design calculations. Findings: Saudi Arabia is embarking on a massive solar energy program as it plans to have over 200 GW of installed capacity by 2030. With solar energy being the most abundant of the available renewable resource for the country, PV is going to be one of the main technologies in achieving the set targets. The country has, however, unlike global trends, traditionally overlooked the small-scale and building-related application of solar PV, focusing mainly on larger projects. This study explores the prospects of utilization of solar PV on building roofs. Building rooftops are constrained in terms of PV application owing to wide ranging obstacles that can be classified into five types – structural, services, accessibility, maintenance and others. The total building rooftop area in the study zone, calculated through ArcGIS has been found to be 857,408 m 2 of which 352,244 m 2 is being used as car parking and hence is not available for PV application. The available roof area, 505,165 m 2 is further hampered by construction and utilities related features including staircases, HVAC systems, skylights, water tanks and satellite dish antennas. Taking into account the relevant obstructive features, the net rooftop area covered by PV panels has been found to be in the range 25–41 percent depending upon the building typology, with residential buildings offering the least. To optimize both the system efficiency and space utilization, PV modeling has been carried out with the help of PVsyst software for both the tilted and horizontal installations. In terms of output, PV panels with tilt angle of 24° have been found to be 9 percent more efficient compared to the horizontally installed ones. Modeling results provide a net annual output 37,750 and 46,050 MWh from 21.44 and 28.51 MW of tilted and horizontal application of PV panels, sufficient to respectively meet 16 and 20 percent of the total campus electricity requirements. Findings of the economic analysis reveal the average SPP for horizontal and tilted applications of the PV to be 9.2 and 8.4 years, respectively. The benefit cost ratio for different types of buildings for horizontal and tilted application has been found to be ranging between 0.89 and 2.08 and 0.83 and 2.15, respectively. As electricity tariff in Saudi Arabia has been increased this year by as much as 45 percent and there are plans to remove $54bn of subsidy by 2020, the cost effectiveness of PV systems will be greatly helped. Application of PV in buildings can significantly improve their environmental performance as the findings of this study reveal that the annual greenhouse gas emission in the KFUPM campus can be reduced by as much as 40,199 tons carbon dioxide equivalent. Originality/value: The PV application on building roof especially from economic perspective is an area which has not been addressed thus far. Khan et al. (2017) studied the power generation potential for PV application on residential buildings in KSA. Asif (2016) also investigated power output potential of PV system in different types of buildings. Dehwas et al. (2018) adopted a detailed approach to determine utilizability of PV on residential building roofs. None of these studies have covered the economics of PV systems. This study attempts to address the gap and contribute to the scholarship on the subject. It targets to determine the power output from different types of building in an urban environment by taking into account building roof conditions. It also provides detailed economic assessment of PV systems. Subsequent environmental savings are also calculated. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Buildings; Environment; Saudi Arabia; Solar energy; Solar PV; Sustainability","alternative energy; assessment method; building; energy use; growth rate; photovoltaic system; solar power; sustainability; Saudi Arabia","Asif, M.; King Fahd University of Petroleum and MineralsSaudi Arabia; email: dr.m.asif@gmail.com",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",20466099,,,,"English","Smart Sustain.

Given the different types of power customers (e.g., residential, commercial and industrial), this work develops a systematic and straightforward framework for the optimal planning of urban solar/wind/biomass (/natural gas) systems at neighbourhood scale using the actual real-time hourly electric loads. In achieving this objective, we defined three power scenarios (i) 100% natural gas; (ii) natural gas and renewables; (iii) 100% renewables (e.g., solar/wind/biomass) and identified the hybrid systems with the least NPC for each of the three power scenarios. Our results indicate that providing per kilowatt-hour renewable electricity to the industrial sector (0.385 USD/kWh) costs 4% less than the commercial (0.399 USD/kWh) and about 5% less than the residential sector (0.418 USD/kWh) at neighbourhood scales. The more significant cost of electricity (COE) of the residential system is primarily due to the greater batteries to solar PV fractions. Also, COE of solar/wind/biomass plant showed to be three times less than the equivalent solar/wind power system. Likewise, by integrating a low-emission natural gas (NG) generator to the hybrid solar/wind/biomass plant, the system's COE reduced by 30% while resulting in close to three order-of-magnitude higher annual greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. To address the model accuracy concerning the uncertainty and variations associated with input variables, we further conducted the sensitivity analysis of the systems’ COE address the model accuracy concerning the uncertainty and variations associated with input variables by changes in the discount rate and capital cost of the PV panels and batteries. As a result, systems’ COE was detected to be more sensitive to the capital cost of batteries than solar panels. This study can help decision-makers in developing more effective policies and mechanisms to support the urban hybrid renewable energy systems. © 2019","City of Victoria; Hybrid renewable power system; Load patterns; Neighborhood scales; Urban electrification","Carbon; Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Decision making; Electric batteries; Electric utilities; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Housing; Hybrid systems; Natural gas; Natural gasoline plants; Photovoltaic cells; Real time systems; Renewable energy resources; Sensitivity analysis; Uncertainty analysis; City of Victoria; Load patterns; Neighborhood scales; Renewable power systems; Urban electrification; Electric power system planning; alternative energy; electrical power; electricity industry; electrification; greenhouse gas; integrated approach; natural gas; neighborhood; strategic approach; urban area; Australia; Victoria [Australia]","Bagheri, M.; Department of Civil Engineering, University of VictoriaCanada; email: Mbagheri@uvic.ca",,"Elsevier Ltd",03062619,,APEND,,"English","Appl.

In addition, a net billing remuneration mechanism for renewable and distributed energy generation has been established by recent Argentinian Law (Dec- 2017). This work presents a profitability analysis of solar photovoltaic projects connected to the grid in the residential sector, considering the Net Billing structure adopted by the Law, and also the Feed-in-Tariff structure that has been used in other countries in order to make comparisons. The valuations are performed for three different projects, taking into account the measured energy data for a year. The well-known Net Present Value method is used as the valuation index. Results show that renewable distributed generation is not profitable for the residential sector at this time, with the current technology costs, national financial conditions and tariffs, combined with some estimations regarding future electric tariffs. Considering this information, the manuscript details a sensitivity analysis of the capital cost, consumed and injected energy prices.

However, their hitherto high capital costs is a key barrier for their further deployment. In order to improve their economic viability, batteries could provide several applications offering revenues. The techno-economic evaluation of batteries simultaneously serving several applications has proven to be challenging due to the trade-offs between energy and power applications. Focusing on residential batteries, we develop an optimisation method for designing optimal value propositions and we test it for four different applications both individually and jointly: PV self-consumption, demand load-shifting, avoidance of PV curtailment and demand peak shaving. Our results show that the combination of all applications currently helps batteries to get closer to profitability, from a net present value (NPV) per unit of capital expenditure (CAPEX) of −0.63 ± 0.04 for PV self-consumption only to −0.36 ± 0.10, with the combination of demand peak-shaving and PV self-consumption adding most value (0.21 ± 0.04). We also find that the annual household's electricity consumption determines the value of energy storage applications. The proposed method allow us to classify storage applications as complementary and substitutive depending on whether their combined application increases their economic attractiveness or not. These results thus offer valuable insight for stakeholders interested in the deployment of energy storage in combination with energy efficiency, heat pumps and electric vehicles such as consumers, utility companies and policy makers. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Battery; Combination of applications; Energy storage; Lithium-ion; PV; Renewable energy","Costs; Economic and social effects; Electric energy storage; Energy efficiency; Energy storage; Heating; Housing; Renewable energy resources; Battery; Capital expenditures; Electricity-consumption; Energy storage applications; Lithium ions; Renewable energies; Renewable energy technologies; Techno-economic evaluation; Lithium-ion batteries; alternative energy; economic analysis; energy efficiency; energy storage; fuel cell; lithium; methodology; optimization; photovoltaic system; residential energy; stakeholder; technical efficiency","Parra, D.; Energy Efficiency Group, Institute for Environmental Sciences and Forel Institute, University of Geneva, Boulevard Carl-Vogt 66, Switzerland; email: david.parra@unige.ch",,"Elsevier Ltd",03062619,,APEND,,"English","Appl.

In contrast to multiple-converter-based microgrids with a common electric bus, using a multiport converter with a common magnetic bus can effectively reduce the number of voltage conversion stages, size, and cost of the renewable energy system and isolates the conversion ports. The resultant topology utilizes a centralized system level control that leads to a faster and more flexible energy management. The proposed microgrid is able to operate in multiple grid-connected and off-grid operation modes. A fuzzy controlled energy management unit (EMU) is designed to select the appropriate operation mode considering both real-time and long-term predicted data of the energy generation and consumption. A mode transition process is designed to smooth the mode variation by using a state transition diagram and bridging modes. To improve the microgrid operation performance, appropriate control techniques, such as synchronized bus-voltage balance, are used. A prototype of the proposed microgrid and the EMU are developed and experimentally tested for three different energy management scenarios.

The optima hybrid energy systems are able to meet 7.23 kWh/day household's electrical energy demand. The hybrid energy system for each of the locations was optimally obtained based on HOMER software computation and TOPSIS multi-criteria decision-making algorithm that considers technical, economic, environmental, and sociocultural criteria. Wind energy potential was conducted for the six locations using the Weibull distribution function; the wind speed ranges between 3.21 and 4.19 m/s at 10 m anemological height. The wind speeds and the wind characteristics were extrapolated for 30 m and 50 m hub heights. The solar resource potentials across the six locations are also presented – ranges between 4.21 and 4.71 kWh/m2/day. The best hybrid system for the locations in Benin-city, Yenagoa and Port Harcourt is the Diesel generator-PV-Wind-Battery system; whereas the best hybrid system for the locations in Warri, Uyo and Calabar is the PV-Wind-Battery system. The hybrid systems in Benin-city, Yenagoa and Port Harcourt emit CO2, only 8.47%, 15.02% and 14.09% of the business as usual (the diesel generator). The payback time ranges between 3.7 and 5.4 years, using 0.893 US$/kWh cost of energy obtained for the business as usual. The cost of energy of the hybrid systems ranges between 0.459 and 0.562 US$/kWh, which compares well with available data in the public domain.

Self-production of electricity for self-consumption has become profitable mainly because of high-distribution costs and taxes imposed by the service providers on commercially produced electricity or because of the subsidies which reduce installation costs. Electrical energy storage can be used to increase the self-consumption potential of photovoltaic power. Additionally, electrical energy storage can lead to other benefits such as demand response or avoiding high load peaks. In this study, the profitability and sizing of a photovoltaic system with an associated electrical energy storage are analyzed from an economic perspective. The novel theory of sizing for profitability is presented and demonstrated using case studies of an apartment building and detached houses in Finland. To maximize the benefits, several alternative models for electricity metering and pricing are used and compared. The results demonstrated that the optimal size of the photovoltaic system could be increased by using electrical energy storage and suitable electricity pricing. This could lead to an increasing amount of photovoltaic production in the residential sector. Additionally, it is possible that when all the incentives are taken into account, electrical energy storage in combination with photovoltaic power generation would be more profitable than photovoltaic power generation alone. Photovoltaic power generation also increased the profitability of electrical energy storage, which could mean that the implementation of electrical energy storage in the residential sector could likewise increase. © 2019","Cost optimization; Energy community model; Energy storage; Photovoltaic; Residential building; Self-consumption","Apartment houses; Electric batteries; Electric energy storage; Energy storage; Photovoltaic cells; Profitability; Solar energy; Community model; Cost optimization; Photovoltaic; Residential building; Self-consumption; Costs; building; cost; electrical power; electricity; energy storage; optimization; photovoltaic system; power generation; residential energy; residential location","Koskela, J.; Tampere University, Korkeakoulunkatu 3, Finland; email: juha.j.koskela@tuni.fi",,"Elsevier Ltd",03062619,,APEND,,"English","Appl.

Some researchers have argued that rooftop PVs should be viewed as an investment, where performance is evaluated using relevant investment analysis methods. This article argues that the proper economic value and climate mitigation potential of rooftop PVs can be assessed only if the market mechanisms and characteristics of the underlying building stock are understood better. This paper utilises a customer-driven investment model to examine the feasible market potential of rooftop PVs in an urban environment. The economic returns of PV installations are calculated for 89,000 buildings separately and by comparing them to the underlying spatial property returns, the profitability and adoption years of rooftop PVs for in different locations are estimated. Implications for CO2 emissions and the impact of the net metering (NM) policy on the rate of adoption are calculated. The results imply that even in Finland rooftop solar PVs are already profitable for a third of the residential building stock and will be profitable for a fourth of the commercial building stock by 2025. Finally, the NM could increase substantially the diffusion rate of solar PVs in the coming years. © 2019 The Authors","Investment analysis; Net metering; Net present value; Photovoltaics; Property yield; Real estate economics","Commerce; Economic analysis; Office buildings; Profitability; Risk assessment; Investment analysis; Net metering; Net present value; Photovoltaics; Property yield; Real estate; Investments; building; cost analysis; economic conditions; economics; electricity; estimation method; performance assessment; photovoltaic system; roof; solar power; urban area; Finland","Vimpari, J.; Aalto University, School of Engineering, Department of Built Environment, P.O.

Moreover, the problem of environmental protection can be considered as a factor of sustainable development. In response to these many challenges, appropriate national and regional policies, as well as mechanisms, have been implemented. In Mali, strong dependence on the importation of oil, growth in demand, and the low rate of electrification have pushed the highest authorities to think of diversified technological solutions like renewable energy for the satisfaction of energy demands, especially photovoltaics, for which the country has significant potential. The hybrid systems used is a compromise, because the emission rate of carbon dioxide emitted by thermal power plants must be reduced and limited to preserve supernatural disasters. For this, hybrid photovoltaic systems coupled to the grid increased, but the management of the production of these photovoltaics poses a lot of problem due to its intermittent status. It is in this context that we conducted an optimization study of a hybrid system photovoltaic connected to the grid. We applied our approach to the most extensive distribution post of Mali capital.

The variability in electricity costs also imposes uncertainties in the future operational costs of air conditioning installations. This study presents an economic analysis considering technical aspects related to the integrated use of solar photovoltaic, as a complementary energy source, and air conditioning systems connected to the utility grid. Two different systems, variable refrigerant flow and chillers, were analyzed in two cities in Brazil, Recife and São Paulo, with varying levels of irradiation and temperature. A mathematical model to evaluate the economic benefits of the integrated use of these systems was implemented considering conditionals and functional aspects of the locations, particularly in the Southern Hemisphere. A sensitivity analysis using Sobol's method to determinate the most sensitive parameters affecting the economic results of the proposed system has been carried out. The results reveal high economic viability for all the systems studied and their most critical variables, namely energy price, energy price annual adjustment, photovoltaic cost and solar panel efficiency. Finally, the findings show that the implementation of air conditioning systems with solar photovoltaic energy could assure high internal rate of return for both cities, with average values around 28% for Recife and 22% for São Paulo, and the variable refrigerant flow system simulations resulted in better indexes when compared to chiller indexes. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Air conditioning; Sensitivity analysis; Solar cooling; Solar photovoltaic","Air conditioning; Cooling systems; Earnings; Economic analysis; Economic and social effects; Energy efficiency; Office buildings; Photovoltaic cells; Refrigerants; Sensitivity analysis; Solar concentrators; Solar power generation; Complementary energy; Electricity consumers; Industrial buildings; Internal rate of return; Solar cooling; Solar photovoltaic energies; Solar photovoltaic system; Solar photovoltaics; Costs","Novaes Pires Leite, G.D.; IFPE – Federal Institute of Education, Science and Technology of Pernambuco, Campus Recife, DACI/CACTR, Av.

In this context, the goal of achieving scale and accelerating growth in the off-grid solar market is now considered prominent and urgent. This paper presents an ethnographic account of the diffusion of Solar Home Systems (SHSs) under the Renewable Energy for Rural Economic Development (RERED) project in Sri Lanka which came to an end in 2011. Based on ethnographic data from 2012 and 2018 it shows that a successful model for the diffusion of SHSs is not necessarily or automatically the same as a successful model for lasting energy access. The paper thus challenges the assumption that accelerated growth in the off-grid solar market will lead straightforwardly to sustainable access to electricity for people in countries of the global south. Focusing on the experiences of project administrators, solar installers and owners of SHSs during and after the RERED project it provides insight into how diffusion was achieved on the ground and with what consequences after the project came to an end. It argues for a need to look at the different kinds of relations, imaginaries, ideas and practices involved in diffusion in action in order to better understand what is being achieved on the ground. © 2018","Diffusion; Energy access; Scalability; Solar; Sri Lanka",,,,"Elsevier Ltd",22146296,,,,"English","Energy Res.

The energy hubs present twenty Canadian buildings’ archetypes: sixteen single residential buildings, primary school, quick service restaurant, office, and supermarket. The hubs are interconnected by thermal and electricity grid and are sharing the locally generated energy to meet the demand loads. Three scenarios, each employing different energy technologies at hubs level were developed and investigated. The performance results were compared to a reference case. A complex optimization model was developed to minimize the energy consumption and environmental impact. The results showed that integrating different residential and commercial buildings with associated generation technologies in smart energy network allows energy sharing among them, enhancing overall efficiency and reducing energy and emissions costs. The study also showed that with this approach an electrical storage capacity of 25% of average electrical load had the lowest energy cost and environmental impact.

However, battery storage systems (BSSs) and sector coupling with heat pumps (HPs) provide promising opportunities to increase PV self-consumption and the value of local energy generation, but change the dynamics of PV grid integration. Thus, an optimization model is proposed to enable all involved stakeholders to analyze interdependencies between different flexibility options for PV systems, incentive, and grid integration. A case study-based approach allows an efficient evaluation of future PV systems with BSSs and HPs, the impact of such decentralized power-heat-storage systems on grid integration as well as proper incentive setting for sector coupling. The analysis shows that such shifting technologies are required to avoid undersizing of PV systems. BSSs only provide a benefit for the adoption of inflexible HPs, which is not preferable from a grid integration point of view. Operational incentives, such as peak charges and PV feed-in limits, offer a chance to foster PV grid integration and use new flexibilities in a grid-supporting way. The adoption of market-oriented operation leads to small benefit for such systems, which heavily rely on PV self-consumption. © 1986-2012 IEEE.","battery storage systems; grid integration; heat pumps; Photovoltaic systems; power system planning","Electric batteries; Electric power transmission networks; Heat pump systems; Heat storage; Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Photovoltaic cells; Pumps; Battery storage system; Grid integration; Heat pumps; Photovoltaic systems; Power system planning; Battery storage","Von Appen, J.; Fraunhofer Institute for Energy Economics, Energy System Technology IEEGermany; email: jan.vonappen@iee.fraunhofer.de",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",08858969,,ITCNE,,"English","IEEE Trans Energy Convers",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85062818034

Renewable energy sources, PV, energy storage systems and bidirectional electricity exchange with the buildings and the grid are taken into account. The considered energy scheme, Building to Vehicle to Building, is analysed by including both buildings and mobility consumptions in the energy balance. Three different management system scenarios, designed to analyse the role of electric vehicles as electricity vector among buildings integrating PV panels and electrical storages, are analysed through a case study analysis. To this aim, a dynamic simulation model, implemented in MatLab, is suitably developed for the assessment of the energy demands and loads of the building, as a function of the considered electric vehicles energy use patterns. Simulation results show that the proposed energy management systems improves the building grid reliance and the grid electricity consumption is remarkably reduced up to 45% and 77% depending on the proposed scenarios. Their energy exchange options also enhanced the energy-matching indexes. The economic analysis highlights the economic viability of the system, as well as the need of suitable funding policies to support the development of such micro-grid systems. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Building integrated photovoltaics; Building to vehicle to building V2B2; Dynamic simulations; Electric vehicle; Net or nearly zero energy buildings; Solar renewable energy sources; Vehicle to home V2H","Buildings; Computer simulation; Economic analysis; Electric energy storage; Electric power transmission networks; Electric vehicles; Energy management; Energy management systems; Energy utilization; MATLAB; Natural resources; Photovoltaic cells; Renewable energy resources; Solar power generation; Building-integrated photovoltaics; Case study analysis; Electrical storages; Electricity exchanges; Energy storage systems; Energy use patterns; Renewable energy source; Solar renewable energies; Zero energy buildings","Buonomano, A.; Department of Industrial Engineering, University of Naples Federico IIItaly; email: annamaria.buonomano@unina.it",,"Elsevier Ltd",13640321,,RSERF,,"English","Renewable Sustainable Energy Rev",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85057753369

Countries such as Bangladesh depend largely on fossil fuels such as diesel fuel and natural gas to produce the main proportion of their electricity. However, this country's combination of limited natural gas reserves high fuel prices and escalating costs of transmission and distribution lines has greatly increased the unit cost of electricity generation and it is becoming difficult for customers to pay for electricity. On the other hand, burning fuel causes environmental pollution that leads to global warming which is ultimately responsible for climate change and its devastating consequences. In this study, we have recommended a stand-alone system for the traditional consumption of domestic electric use at residential units in Bangladesh. We have shown a comparison of using the stand-alone photovoltaic (PV) system with the traditional grid connection. Although the initial set-up cost is high, it becomes profitable as people are supplied with electricity, which is being generated from PV as a result minimizing the energy cost from the grid, and in addition, they can later make savings from this system. This paper, therefore, aims at determining the optimum size of the rooftop solar home system that will fulfil all the criteria for powering up electrical appliances at an affordable price. Comparative analysis of both energy systems based on the cost calculation has been performed by means of the Hybrid Optimization of Multiple Energy Renewables (HOMER) software.

Assuming that an energy storage device (ESD) is equipped with a set of predetermined real-time control modes, the dispatch objective is to select an optimal mode instead of a continuous charging or discharging power value. A two-stage algorithm is developed for mode selection. In the first stage, a sliding 24 h economic model predictive control algorithm is used to determine the power outputs of the ESD for the next 24 h. In the second stage, the output sign for the next time step determines the class of modes to be elected (charging or discharging). The information from the first stage is used to compute the total cost for each selected mode. The mode with the lowest day-ahead cost is chosen. The residential electricity consumption data collected in the PECAN Street Project is used in the simulation to validate the performance of the proposed algorithm. Simulation results show that using a mode-based approach reduces the sensitivity to forecasting errors along with load and solar variability.

Meanwhile, cities are the main recipients of this type of programs; therefore, the development of methodologies for the elaboration of prospective urban-energy studies is really important to efficiently use the available resources. Nevertheless, cities have substantial differences among themselves in terms of structure, conformation and growth, along different regions in the world. Hence, it is necessary that methodologies can respond to different realities that each case presents. In Argentina, as in many developing countries, cities are heterogeneous within their own urban structure, manifesting large socio-economic, morphological and infrastructure inequalities. This situation forces us to board the territory in a particular way and, therefore, to develop a proper methodology for the construction of prospective studies for our context. Thus, this paper proposes an innovative methodology that disaggregates the city in urban areas with similar internal behaviors [homogeneous areas (HA)]; which allows us to assess specific EES/RES measures for each of them, such as the application of regulations, programs or incentives for: the improvement of new and existing building's envelopes; the insertion of solar energy systems for space heating, sanitary hot water or PV; the replacement of energy-intensive appliances; among other options. This analysis considers socio-demographic, urban-morphology, building and energy consumption variables/indicators, which enable us to identify critical aspects in each homogenous area. This approach is unusual in most prospective urban-energy studies, where the study areas are addressed as a single element or, alternatively, a small urban sector is used as an example. In this context, this paper presents the methodology for the urban-energy diagnosis stage, obtaining as results the construction of the “base year” model into the LEAP software and the energy guidelines for each homogenous area. The continuation of this research, with the assessment of “alternative scenarios” will be presented in future publications. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Energy consumption; Residential sector; Scenarios; Urban areas; Urban-energy diagnosis","Developing countries; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Solar energy; Developed countries; Innovative methodologies; Renewable energies; Residential sectors; Scenarios; Solar energy systems; Urban areas; Urban energy; Application programs; alternative energy; assessment method; building; detection method; energy efficiency; energy resource; energy use; methodology; photovoltaic system; residential location; scenario analysis; software; sustainability; urban area; Argentina","Chévez, P.J.; Instituto de Investigaciones y Políticas del Ambiente Construido – IIPAC – (Built Environment Policy Research Institute), Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas – CONICET – (National Council of Scientific and Technical Research), Universidad Nacional de La Plata – UNLP – (National University of La Plata), Facultad de Arquitectura y Urbanismo – FAU – (School of Architecture and Planning), Street 47 N°162, Argentina; email: che.pedro@hotmail.com",,"Elsevier Ltd",03062619,,APEND,,"English","Appl.

The focus is on both wholesale energy trade functions, i.e. day-ahead market optimisation, and ancillary services to the operators of the transmission and distribution systems, i.e. provision of automatic frequency restoration reserves and peak shaving services. The control framework is generic, scalable, and is effectively configured to address all those diverse needs originating from the lower level, i.e. the device or the user, to the distribution and transmission levels. The work includes the establishment of procedures to identify and solve possible conflicts between the operators of the transmission and distribution systems when procuring ancillary services with competing objectives. The framework is applied on a case study focusing on an aggregation of residential buildings in the Netherlands which are equipped with photovoltaic installations and battery-based energy storage systems. The annual costs and benefits are calculated by using historical market data, whereas the simulation scenarios address the impact of different levels of generation and demand forecasting errors in the economic performance. The outcome of computer simulations provides an informative insight into the differences between the strategies of aggregator companies, and the potential of the investigated markets.

The objective of this study was to analyse the scope of the investment in the photovoltaic self-consumption of buildings in order to promote the creation of Prosumers communities within the cities. The operation of this model is based on the scalability of the Nearly Zero Energy concept from buildings to cities and seeks to evaluate Nearly Zero Energy Cities (nZEC): cities made up of Nearly Zero Energy Buildings (nZEB) and other installations of distributed generation to cover their energy demand by use of local renewable resources to the detriment of external resources. By using public data, we apply this model with the aim of economically evaluating the investment of six packages of energy rehabilitation and photovoltaic self-consumption in 17% of the residential buildings (37,800) in the city of Barcelona. To do this, we simulated 37 years of electricity distribution among Consumers, Producers and a hypothetical peer-to-peer community of Prosumers during the period 2014–2050 in hourly time intervals.

Ensuring that optimal operation is always achieved, using energy management systems and control algorithms, is essential in this endeavor. Here, a new real-time pricing scheme, the Danish flexible pricing scheme, illustrates how residential PV and battery systems can optimize the electricity bill of households, without changing consumption behavior or providing grid services in exchange. This means that the only addition is PV production, storage, and control. A case study is constructed from Danish household consumption data, irradiance measurements, and recorded spot prices. With the input data, the pricing scheme, and the energy flow, simulation models are computed in MATLAB, thereby validating the algorithmic potential and finding the best strategy for charging and discharging the energy storage unit. Different methods are compared to list the viable options and evaluate them, based on the economic feasibility for the household. Furthermore, a discussion of the system implementation is also included to highlight technical difficulties, co-integration opportunities, short-comings, and advantages present in the case study. In conclusion, it is possible to make renewable energy generation, and storage, viable for a Danish residential household under the new pricing scheme. © 2019 by the authors.","Behind-the-meter storage; Energy management; Real-time pricing; Renewable energy; Residential photovoltaic","Costs; Digital storage; Energy management; Energy management systems; Housing; MATLAB; Real time systems; Renewable energy resources; Secondary batteries; Economic feasibilities; Irradiance measurement; Real time pricing; Renewable energies; Renewable energy generation; Residential photovoltaic; System implementation; Technical difficulties; Battery storage","Nørgaard, J.B.; Department of Energy Technology, Aalborg UniversityDenmark; email: jacobbitsch.n@gmail.com",,"MDPI AG",19961073,,,,"English","Energies",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85062405960

Most of the models or available tools do not provide both an economic and environmental assessment of the energy systems and thus lead to the design of systems that are sub-optimal. A flexible and modular simulation tool, Eco-Sim, is thus developed in the current study to conduct a comprehensive techno-economic and environmental assessment of a distributed energy system considering different configuration scenarios. Subsequently, an intermodel comparison is conducted with the Hybrid Optimization Model for Electric Renewable (HOMER) Pro as well as with a state-of-the-art industrial tool. Eco-Sim is then extended by including the heating demand, thermal conversion (by using heat pumps and solar thermal) methods and thermal storage. A parametric analysis is conducted by considering different capacities of solar photovoltaics (PV), solar thermal panels and energy storage technologies. The levelized cost of electricity, the autonomy level and the CO 2 emissions are used as the key performance indicators. Based on the analysis of a study case conducted in a neighbourhood in Geneva, Switzerland, the study reveals that, with the present market prices for batteries and seasonal changes in solar energy potential, the combination of solar PV with battery storage doesn’t bring a significant autonomy to the system and increases the CO 2 emissions of the system. However, the integration of thermal storage and solar thermal generation is shown to considerably increase the autonomy of the neighbourhood. Finally, multiple scenarios are also run in order to evaluate the sensitivity of economic parameters on the performance indicators of the system. Under the assumptions of the model, to foster investments in solar PV and battery installations, falling installation costs or stronger policies in favor of renewable energy seem necessary for the future. © 2019 by the authors.","Battery storage; Electricity price; Solar energy; Solar photovoltaic; Techno-economic assessment; Thermal energy storage","Benchmarking; Carbon dioxide; Carbon footprint; Climate change; Costs; Electric batteries; Environmental impact; Heat storage; Investments; Solar concentrators; Solar energy; Solar heating; Solar power generation; Thermal energy; Decentralized energy system; Economic and environmental assessments; Electricity prices; Energy storage technologies; Integrate renewable energies; Levelized cost of electricities; Solar photovoltaics; Techno-economic assessment; Battery storage","Mauree, D.; Solar Energy and Building Physics Laboratory, Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de LausanneSwitzerland; email: dasaraden.mauree@gmail.com",,"MDPI AG",19961073,,,,"English","Energies",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85062400199

The daily solar radiation ranges from 3.79 to 6.71 kWh/m2/day and the total distributed load supplied by solar electricity is 8876.4 kWh/day which is 0.82% of overall plant load. The results show that proposed system reduces pollutant emissions by almost 23% with an increase of NPC by 3.075% and COE by 0.6436% only.

Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and ε-constraint method were used to simultaneously minimize total system cost, unmet load, and CO2 emissions. One optimal solution was chosen among the solutions set and analyzed. The remote Saharan village of Tiberkatine, province of Tamanrasset in southern Algeria was considered as a case study. The hybrid system supplied the energy demand of 20 households. It was found that the optimal solution can supply energy without unmet load, the minimum cost of energy COE is 0.37 $/kWh with 93% renewable fraction. A sensitivity analysis was performed on the optimal system to study the impact of three parameters (load consumption, εCO2, and εLLP constraints) on the system behavior.

Three different battery technologies (lead acid, lithium-ion, and vanadium redox flow) as well as the effects of load demand scalability are considered. The optimisations are based on Cost of Energy (COE) but the analyses consider several performance indicators including Excess Energy (EE), Renewable Penetration (RP), and Duty Factor (DF). Optimisations are done using the software tool HOMER (Hybrid Optimisation Model for Electric Renewable) and consider systems spanning 10 to 50 houses (210 kWh/yr to 1050 kWh/yr) and subject to modelling featuring hourly temporal resolution. A sensitivity analysis is also conducted to see the effects of various input parameters on the Cost of Energy. Results indicate that both PV/ICE/Li-ion and PV/ICE/LAB hybrid systems have comparable COE (0.31–0.32$/kWh). This occurs largely because the capital cost is lower for PV/ICE/LAB, but this is offset by relatively high replacement and O&M costs. This study highlights the need to use multi-objective optimisations (system sizing not just based on COE), and to specifically include lifecycle emissions when comparing between stand-alone hybrid systems that feature multiple options of battery technology.

Our study suggests that Qatar's residential PV adoption is strongly promoted by the falling cost of PV and can be further facilitated through the reduction of electricity subsidies and the extension of the electricity tariff to Qatari households, which are currently exempt. The introduction of a carbon tax can also play a role in accelerating residential PV adoption, if above $8 per metric ton of carbon dioxide equivalent.

Two sub-scenarios were examined that foresee the purchase of the EV as an alternative to a vehicle powered, respectively, by petrol and diesel.

The values of the bill savings of all groups are higher under the conditions of higher buyback rates/credit, lower PV-to-load ratios, and higher retail rates. Under the current retail rate design, the values of the bill savings of residential and small general service groups are slightly higher than those of medium and large general service groups, since there are demand charges for the latter two groups that cannot be completely avoided using rooftop PV. Load shapes do not significantly impact the values of the bill savings for all customer groups. Additionally, net metering causes a smaller variation in bill savings as compared to net billing, implying more flexibility for the customers to size their PV systems over a broader range.

Solar energy potential of the campus and the real electricity consumption of the hospital collected over one-year period were used in the design of the microgrid. The optimization takes into account the overall performance and the economic feasibility of the microgrid system over its lifetime. The designed microgrid consisting of photovoltaic (PV) modules, diesel generators, batteries, converters, and loads is configured as a grid-connected hybrid system. In order to optimize the system, PV module failures, increase in demand, increase in fuel cost of diesel generators, and mains interruptions are defined as performance variables and realistically modelled in the HOMER simulation. Later, both the individual and the combined effects of these variables on the performance of the microgrid was investigated via simulation using five operating scenarios. The objective was to obtain reliable data from the microgrid design that reflects the realistic operation of microgrid over its 25-years of service time. Simulation results have shown that the economic feasibility and the performance of the microgrid are greatly affected by these factors. For example, in a worst case scenario where all variables are acting together, net present cost increases to 40.44%, cost of energy increases to 21.92%, and operating cost rises to 53.91%. Moreover, the results show a reduction up to 33.30% in the portion of energy that is directly transferred from renewable sources to the load. The simulation results were then used to optimize the design of the microgrid system for the best overall performance. In conclusion, it was demonstrated that the proposed hybrid microgrid system supplies the energy demand of the hospital, lowers the cost of electricity consumption, provides a reasonable payback time, and the best of all, it contributes to the clean campus concept. © 2019.

Providing uninterrupted power the microgrid was composed of seven components - solar photovoltaics, wind-turbines, lead acid batteries, biodiesel generators, fuel cells, electrolyzers and H2 tanks. Firstly, detailed mathematical models that predicted the hourly energy generation for each of the components were developed and validated. Secondly, based on an electricity dispatch strategy, configurations having lowest LCOE (Levelized Cost of Energy) were determined using an evolutionary optimization technique - Genetic Algorithm (GA). Results for a single home microgrid were verified using an exhaustive search technique that scanned the entire design space to find the lowest LCOE configuration. The microgrid size was subsequently increased to satisfy power requirements for 10 and 50 homes and new lowest LCOE configurations were determined using GA to examine the economies of scale effect on sustainability. The LCOEs obtained were in the range of $0.32–0.42/kWh and were also compared with similar economic analyses available in the literature.

When optimally designed, HESs prove to be more reliable and economical than single energy source systems. This study examines the feasibility of a combined dispatch (CD) control strategy for a photovoltaic (PV)/diesel/battery HES by combining the load following (LF) strategy and cycle charging (CC) strategy. HOMER software is used as a tool for optimization analysis by investigating the techno-economic and environmental performance of the proposed system under the LF strategy, CC strategy, and combined dispatch CD strategy. The simulation results reveal that the CD strategy has a net present cost (NPC) and cost of energy (COE) values of $110,191 and $0.21/kWh, which are 20.6% and 4.8% lower than those of systems utilizing the LF and CC strategies, respectively. From an environmental point of view, the CD strategy also offers the best performance, with CO 2 emissions of 27,678 kg/year.

The temperature profiles of a 10-year period are gathered based on the existing solar and wind condition data. Simulation, economical and technical evaluations of this hybrid system are studied with the aid of HOMER software. To reach a proper independent structure from the total net present cost and energy cost viewpoints, thousands of cases were studied. Change of the factor investing on PV panels together with the amount of the sun radiance as well as change of the investment factor of wind turbines with the consideration of wind velocity and sun radiance on the system layout are studied and discussed. The initial investment is 440 thousand dollars and the contribution portion of the renewable energies is 84% for the case containing four wind turbines and a power grid system (optimal system). This optimal system returns the investment over a 4-year period which is very economically attractive. The optimal system for the case with a low mean wind speed of 3 m/s is preferred to involve 13-kW photovoltaic (PV) panels, one-wind turbine and a 10-kW converter with a power grid network. Results shown that when the cost of the PV panel is 0.6 times higher than the current cost, a system consisting 4-wind turbines connected to the grid network is still the optimal system. In addition, a sensitivity analysis is made on the load demand of the hybrid system and the renewable energy resource. As a result, the most influential variables on the performance of the system are identified in this research. Based on the economic and technical evaluation, establishing a hybrid grid system for a residential urban area is perfectly reasonable with the investment return during the fourth year of a 25-year project lifetime. Also, among the systems studied, a system with four wind turbines and a power grid system is chosen as an optimal system due to the fact that the region has favorable potential for wind energy. © The Author(s) 2018.

We describe a UK field trial in 48 homes of an approach to this problem aimed at directly matching local supply and demand. This combined a community-based business model with social engagement and demand response technology employing both thermal and electrical energy storage. A proportion of these homes (14) were equipped with rooftop photovoltaics (PV) amounting to a total of 45 kWp; the business model enabled the remaining 34 homes to consume the electricity exported from the PV-equipped dwellings at a favourably low tariff in the context of a time-of-day tariff scheme. We report on the useful financial return achieved by all participants, their overall experience of the trial, and the proportion of local generation consumed locally. The energy storage devices were controlled, with user oversight, to respond automatically to signals indicating the availability of low cost electricity either from the photovoltaics or the time of day grid tariff. A substantial response was observed in the resulting demand profile from these controls, less so from demand scheduling methods which required regular user configuration. Finally results are reported from a follow-up fully commercial implementation of the concept showing the viability of the business model. We conclude that the sustainability of the transition to renewable energy can be strengthened with a community-oriented approach as demonstrated in the trial that supports users through technological change and improves return on investment by matching local generation and consumption. © 2018 by the author.","Business model; Community energy; Demand response; Energy storage; Home battery; Renewable energy; Time of use tariff","alternative energy; business development; cost analysis; demand analysis; demand-side management; electrical power; electricity supply; energy storage; fuel cell; instrumentation; local participation; power generation; tariff structure; thermal power; United Kingdom","Boait, P.; Institute of Energy and Sustainable Development, De Montfort University, Queens Building, The Gateway, United Kingdom; email: p.boait@dmu.ac.uk",,"MDPI AG",20711050,,,,"English","Sustainability",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85059512314

It will provide a basis for the configuration of a practical microgrid. Initially, the actual power demand in a particular university area, namely, Khulna University of Engineering & Technology in Bangladesh, is measured, and then, the process of designing the optimized model is demonstrated with an initial choice of various parameters and constraints. Its inputs are climate data, electrical loads, technical and economic parameters of the equipment used for generation, sensitivity variables, grid parameters, and project economics and constraints. The best mix of solar photovoltaics (PV) and wind power is determined considering the most profitable size of the PV's inverter for different plants. The optimization results obtained through HOMER show that a specific PV panel does not need an inverter of the same capacity and a smaller one results in a lower investment. The analysis has been carried out by considering annual increase rates of both the load and the grid power price, which makes the result more realistic. The optimal size and control strategy are determined based on the net present cost, levelized cost of energy, increased rates of load and grid price, renewable fraction, and greenhouse gas emissions. A comparative analysis between the fixed and variable data for load and cost demonstrates that an optimal inverter-PV ratio, with the best mix of PV and wind energy, provides an optimum solution for all models. An economically viable plant size of 1.5 MW for the considered case is achieved. © 2019 Author(s).",,"Cost benefit analysis; Economics; Electric inverters; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Investments; Photovoltaic cells; Solar power generation; Wind power; Comparative analysis; Control strategies; Economic parameters; Economically viable; Generation capacity; Hybrid power systems; Hybrid renewable energy systems; Solar photovoltaics; Electric power transmission networks",,,"American Institute of Physics Inc.",19417012,,,,"English","J.

Thermal energy self-sufficiency is enlarged by driving a heat pump (HP) with the electricity surplus of the PV system. The size of the thermal storage tank was varied from 0.3 up to 50 m 3 . Further on, the effect of using the building mass as a thermal storage was investigated. The considerations deal with theoretical investigations of the sizing of both electrical- and thermal storage systems in order to reduce the load on the supply grids under economic conditions. The investigation of storage capacities is based on thermal-energetic building and plant simulations. A new cost-benefit assessment for storage systems, which considers calendrical lifespan and charging cycles, is presented. The simulation results show that small to middle sized decentralized electrical and thermal storage are an economic way to keep the power grid stable during day cycle, while reducing CO 2 -emissions by using more renewable energies. Here the thermal mass of the building can also be used as a short-term storage.

In the present work, Adjustable Robust Optimization (ARO) is used to include uncertainty in the optimization model, and a comparative study of modifications to this formulation is carried out to determine its potential and limitations. The comparative analysis is performed from the point of view of average cost and risk, after performing Monte Carlo simulation. Simulations show the advantages of using an ARO framework when compared to deterministic approaches and also allow us to conclude about the advantages of using the proposed alternative formulation to find more attractive solutions for an aggregator. © 2019 by the Authors.","Aggregators; Prosumers; Robust optimization; Smart homes; Storage; Uncertainty","Automation; Commerce; Cost benefit analysis; Energy storage; Housing; Intelligent buildings; Intelligent systems; Monte Carlo methods; Optimization; Photovoltaic cells; Risk assessment; Water heaters; Aggregators; Prosumers; Robust optimization; Smart homes; Uncertainty; Power markets","Kariniotakis, G.; PERSEE-Centre for Processes, Renewable Energies and Energy Systems, MINES ParisTech, PSL University, 1 rue Claude Daunesse, France; email: carlos-adrian.correa_florez@mines-paristech.fr",,"MDPI AG",19961073,,,,"English","Energies",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85066029965

The simulation is based on two models of solar panels, one with Sun-tracker and the other one is stationary to illustrate differences between the PVs output power related to either tracking the sun or with fixed installation. PVs are simulated with three types of output power, 150 KW, 300 and 600 KW. After calculating the output power for the PV panels, it is possible to find the PVs optimum placement and sizing for a 69 IEEE RTS distribution power system in order to reduce power line losses and also receiving the maximum profit by selling the generated power via PVs. Placing and sizing the PVs are limited by common power system limitation such as voltage profile as well as overcurrent violation in the distribution system. Aside from that additional limitations such as reverse power flow, power line capacity and different group of loads, such as residential, industrial and agricultural, are considered in this paper in order to make the simulation more realistic. Moreover, meteorological data is collected from metrological organization of Mashhad, Iran. Finally, after calculating the injected power using PVs the amount of reduced energy from the main feeder is calculated; and consequently, economic benefit for the customers is evaluated.

The need to mitigate these issues with simple yet effective measures in countries with high PV penetrations is likely to drive the adoption of limits on the very exports that affect this infrastructure. Defining the most adequate limit, however, requires understanding the tradeoffs between the technical benefits and the effects on PV owners. This paper proposes two methodologies: an optimal power flow (OPF) based technique to define the export limit that solves technical problems with minimal curtailment, and a Monte Carlo based analysis to investigate the spectrum of such tradeoffs considering different PV penetrations and export limits. A real U.K. residential LV network with 180 customers is analyzed using realistic 1-min resolution daily load and PV generation profiles across seasons. Results demonstrate that, for DNOs, the OPF-based approach is effective in determining the most technically adequate export limit. However, for policy makers, the spectrum of tradeoffs provided by the Monte Carlo approach can help defining export limits that reduce curtailment at the expense of partially mitigating technical issues. © 2018 IEEE.","Low voltage networks; optimal power flow; photovoltaics; PV management","Acoustic generators; Commerce; Electric load flow; Housing; Monte Carlo methods; Photovoltaic cells; Distribution network operators; Effective measures; Low voltage network; Monte Carlo approach; Optimal power flows; Photovoltaics; Residential photovoltaic; Technical challenges; Economic and social effects","Ochoa, L.F.; Department of Electrical Engineering, University of MelbourneAustralia; email: luis_ochoa@ieee.org",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",08858950,,ITPSE,,"English","IEEE Trans Power Syst",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85050227694

For this purpose, five scenarios of system’s renewable energy fractions (namely 0% renewable energy, 25% renewable energy, 50% renewable energy, 75% renewable energy and 100% renewable energy) were modeled, simulated, optimized and analyzed. The results obtained using the Hybrid Optimization of Multiple Energy Resources (HOMER) software of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)/USA showed that the hybrid system with 50% renewable energy fraction is the optimal one in terms of both its technical performance and the cost of generated electricity which was found to be $0.202/kWh. It was also proved that deploying this system for electricity generation reduces the emissions by 49% compared to the conventional system comprising only diesel generator sets. Moreover, a sensitivity analysis was conducted to reveal the impact of diesel prices, solar radiation and wind speed on the cost of generated–by this optimal system–electricity. The obtained results indicated that diesel price is the most influential factor in the cost of generated electricity. It changes from $0.168/kWh to $0.0.237/kWh for a variation in diesel prices from −30% to +30% of its current prices. The effect of battery bank’s storage capacity on the performance and cost of electricity, generated by the optimal system was investigated as well. The results showed that varying the storage capacity from −30% to +30% (from the base case value of 2971 kWh) increases the hybrid system’s capital cost, but reduces each of the excess electricity, diesel generators operation hours, the annual diesel consumption and consequently the CO2 emissions. However, increasing the storage capacity from −30% till 0% (the base case), reduces the cost of electricity, while increasing the storage capacity from the base case of 0% to +30% does not affect the cost of generated electricity. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","HOMER; Hybrid PV-wind-diesel-battery system; renewable energy fraction; sensitivity analysis; storage capacity; techno-economic analysis","Cost benefit analysis; Cost reduction; Diesel engines; Economic analysis; Electric batteries; Energy resources; Hybrid systems; Optimal systems; Power quality; Sensitivity analysis; Wind; HOMER; Renewable energy fractions; Storage capacity; Techno-Economic analysis; Wind-diesel-battery systems; Electric power generation","Hrayshat, E.S.; Department of Mechatronics and Power Engineering, College of Engineering, Tafila Technical UniversityJordan; email: ehrayshat@ttu.edu.jo",,"Taylor and Francis Inc.",15567036,,,,"English","Energy Sources Recovery Util.

Energy storage has the potential to solve those issues although its technical, economic, and environmental impact is up for debate. The paper presents a study about a PV-battery energy storage system installed in a gridconnected residential apartment in the Green Energy Laboratory at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China. Daily experimental results show how the presence of energy storage reduces the midday feed-in of excess PV power and the evening peak demand, providing benefits to the distribution network in terms of reduced voltage swings and peak load. Considering the Chinese context, an economic analysis is carried out to assess the profitability of residential PV-battery systems, using the net present value as the economic indicator of an 18-year investment in which the battery pack is replaced twice (6 life years). The analysis shows that such system is not economically viable due to a combination of low electricity prices, valuable PV incentives, and high technology costs. However, considering a future scenario of doubled electricity tariff, halved export tariff, and falling technology costs (-66% battery and -17% PV and inverter), PV-battery investment becomes profitable and shows more resilience to future scenarios than PV-only investment.

This work describes the potentials of using solar PV/biogas power system to supply the slaughterhouse located in Ado Ekiti, South West Nigeria through an optimal design and techno-economic analysis. With an annual average daily radiation of 4.93 kWh/m2/d, the facility slaughters an average of 25 cows daily to yield a biomass supply of about 1150 kg/day.

However, PV self-consumption systems at the residential or small business level can be designed with the aims of reducing the electricity consumption from the conventional local grid and achieving competitiveness with grid electricity prices. These criteria will provide not only greater environmental benefits, security and independence of the grid but it will make the cost of PV self-consumption electricity competitive with electricity prices from the power grid. In this sense, this paper proposes a method to size the generator for a PV self-consumption system based on cost-competitiveness, maximizing direct self-consumption. The method will be applied for three different households located in the south of Spain using the household daily consumption and generation profiles for a single year. However, the method here illustrated can be applied to other countries.

Because the delivered photovoltaic Watt is very expensive, the photovoltaic system must be correctly and optimally dimensioned the proposed system in technical (feasible) and economical (lowest cost) term, it depends on several parameters such as orientation, tilt angle, type of modules. Among these parameters, tilt angle and module technologies are the ones have a significant impact on the PV system performance. In this study, three different technologies of PV generators with 5 kWp capacity each (Si-mono, Si-poly, Si-amorph) for Alger location in Algeria are simulated. PV generators have been mounted on a roof surface and positioned at different tilt angles ranging from 0° to 90°, in order to find the best configuration of PV generator to be installed in residential customer at house roof.

This work presents a transactive energy scheme to jointly optimise the operation of smart distribution networks, residential flexible loads and distributed PV-battery systems. With this aim, a day-ahead dynamic pricing (DADP) is proposed, which results in the economic social welfare maximisation of both distribution system operator (DSO) and prosumers in a 24 h time window, considering AC network constraints. DADP consists of distribution locational marginal prices that quantify DSO power delivery costs over time and across distribution network buses. To enable the participation of PV batteries in the DADP settlement scheme, and to consider the value of stored energy, a preference model is proposed on the willingness of prosumers to charge or discharge active power from batteries. The social welfare maximisation problem is proposed within the context of Latin American distribution networks and solved using the alternating direction method of multipliers, which is tested via simulations on a radial test feeder. Results indicate that DADP outperforms FIT scheme in terms of social welfare, and volume of exchanges among prosumers, DSO and wholesale market. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2019.",,"Electric power transmission; Secondary batteries; Alternating direction method of multipliers; Distribution systems; Locational marginal prices; Operational state; Optimal dynamics; Preference modeling; Smart distribution networks; Wholesale markets; Costs","Palacios, J.P.; Institute of Electric Energy, National University of San Juan-CONICET, Av.

With the presence of a microgrid power market (MPM), control of the BES systems is formulated as a self-interested distributed control problem, as individual DEMPC controllers minimize their local economic cost functions based on the price prediction of MPM. Due to the intermittent nature of photovoltaic (PV) power generations and load demands, the DEMPC without proper coordination or constraints may lead to excessive energy trading and price oscillations in MPM. To solve this problem, dissipativity theory with dynamic supply rates is adopted in this paper to deal with the interactions between individual users and the MPM. The microgrid-wide performance requirement of attenuation of the net power fluctuations with respect to time-varying PV generation and demands, is converted into the dissipative trajectory constraints imposed on individual DEMPC controllers. The proposed approach is scalable as it does not require online iterative optimizations across the controller network. A case study is presented to illustrate the proposed method. © 2018","Dissipativity; Distributed battery energy storage systems; Distributed economic MPC; Residential microgrids","Commerce; Controllers; Cost functions; Distributed parameter control systems; Electric batteries; Housing; Iterative methods; Model predictive control; Photovoltaic cells; Power markets; Predictive control systems; Battery energy storage; Battery energy storage systems; Battery energy storages (BES); Dissipativity; Distributed control problems; Distributed economic MPC; Micro grid; Performance requirements; Battery storage","Bao, J.; School of Chemical Engineering, The University of New South WalesAustralia; email: j.bao@unsw.edu.au",,"Elsevier Ltd",09591524,,JPCOE,,"English","J Process Control",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85057114906

Also, the effect of different parameters on the feasibility of the PV system was evaluated. The optimal battery capacity (OBC) was determined for different saving targets of the annual electricity consumption of the chosen building. For this aim, real electricity consumption data of a residential building in Landskrona, Sweden, was used as energy consumption profile. A Solar World SW325XL, which is a monocrystalline solar panel, was selected as PV panel. The calculations were performed under the metrological and economic conditions of southern Sweden. Different working parameters (WPs) were considered (prices of the battery, feed-in tariffs, and saving targets). The performed calculations show that the optimal battery capacity (OBC), in which the payback time (PBT) of the system is maximized, strongly depends on the WP. The proper selection of the battery can considerably increase the economic feasibility of the PV system in southern Sweden. However, in some cases, using battery can have a negative impact on the PBT of the system. The results show that the electricity price, the module price, the inverter price, and the inverter lifetime have the highest effect on the PBT. © 2018 by the authors.

This trend can be observed in many developed Western economies—for example, in the United States, as well as in the United Kingdom. Hence, the role of innovative policies for promoting energy efficiency is becoming crucial in transition to the post-carbon economy. The shift to the carbon-free future make all actors to face forgoing commitments Nevertheless, customers and residential households are the first and the most important players in the pursuit of the energy-efficient future. Without them, carbon-free economy based on RES would never take the shape as envisaged. Our paper focuses on the innovative strategies and policies studying the effect and the scope of RES penetration into the households. We employ and empirical analysis of the effects from using RES in households using an example of the residential households in the northwest region of the United Kingdom (UK) with and without solar photovoltaic (PV) panels and electric vehicles (EV). We analyse the four scenarios that are aimed at analysing the system dynamics and providing differentiation between systems in terms of the varying values of the gross demand, tariffs, metered import, and the total revenue. Our results demonstrate that the solar PV leads to the transfer of costs and wealth regardless of the ownership of PV and EVs. Solar energy generation reduces the share of UK solar PV households per kWh costs of the distribution system which causes the augmenting of the per unit charges as well as to the changes in payments for the electricity that impoverishes less wealthy customer groups. It also becomes clear that with the increase of EV penetration, the existing energy efficiency schemes would have to be revised. © 2019 by the authors.","Consumer attitudes; Electric vehicles; Energy efficiency; Renewable energy; Solar photovoltaic","Carbon; Economics; Electric automobiles; Electric vehicles; Housing; Photovoltaic effects; Solar concentrators; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Consumer attitudes; Distribution systems; Empirical analysis; Energy generations; Innovative strategies; Renewable energies; Renewable energy source; Solar photovoltaics; Energy efficiency","Strielkowski, W.; Centre for Energy Studies, Prague Business School, Prague, Werichova 1145/29, Czech Republic; email: strielkowski@pbs-education.cz",,"MDPI AG",19961073,,,,"English","Energies",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85065493192

To evolve to the required level of performance, an existing building must already consume little energy. On this basis, a local power generation system can be associated with the existing infrastructure to make it an energy generator. The energy balance is positive when there is surplus production. In this paper, we present a feasibility study of a project carried out as part of a cross-border cooperation between Italy and Tunisia setup at Research and Technology Center (CRTEn) in Borj-Cedria Tunisia. This project foresees the realization of sustainable energy microsystems device based on renewable sources that allows the integration and optimal management of energy services and resources gravitate to geographical areas such as groups of buildings and residential-type consumption centres. The feasibility study was conducted by the HOMER software.

Solar PV is a growing industry and it is beginning to play a major role in the electricity mix in our country. The objective of this study is to understand the need for India to commoditise PV for effective implementation, bringing about a paradigm shift in harnessing energy from the abundant freely available sunshine. Commoditization can be a prerequisite for enhanced and speedier adoption of PV even in homes. The study is based on the secondary data collected from Research articles, renewable energy journals and websites of solar energy organisations. The study helps understand the elements and the factors responsible for commoditisation which can culminate in aggressive market development of RTS. Assessing India’s stance to bring about rapid commoditisation and how best to tackle the problems encountered in the Indian scenario are elucidated. The basic idea of the researcher is to lay emphasis on producing a roof top model that can be plugged in a socket to produce your own energy.The study concludes that potential challenges like effective net metering implementation, grid connectivity, fragmented electricity market, thrust for green financing etc. have to be addressed to trigger the growth of RTS. © IAEME Publication","Commoditisation; Grid; Photo voltaic (PV); Residential Solar Roof Tops (RTS) Regulatory policies; Tax incentives",,,,"IAEME Publication",09766502,,,,"English","Int.

Although this topic is already being discussed in literature, there is still a lack of experience on how such a system, of allowing bidirectional power flows between an EV and building, will work in a residential environment. The challenge is to optimize the interplay of electrical load, photovoltaic (PV) generation, EV, and optionally a home energy storage system (HES). In total, fourteen different scenarios are explored for a German household. A two-step approach is used, which combines a computationally efficient linear optimizer with a detailed modelling of the non-linear effects on the battery. The change in battery degradation, storage system efficiency, and operating expenses (OPEX) as a result of different, unidirectional and bidirectional, EV charging schemes is examined for both an EV battery and a HES. The simulations show that optimizing unidirectional charging can improve the OPEX by 15%. The addition of V2B leads to a further 11% cost reduction, however, this corresponds with a 12% decrease in EV battery lifetime. Techno-economic analysis reveals that the V2B charging solution with no HES leads to strong self-consumption improvements (EUR 1381 savings over ten years), whereas, this charging scheme would not be justified for a residential prosumer with a HES (only EUR 160 savings). © 2019 by the authors.","Battery degradation; Battery energy storage system; Charging scheme; Efficiency; Electric vehicle; Linear programming; Lithium ion battery; Operating expenses; Residential battery storage; Vehicle-to-building","Battery storage; Cost reduction; Economic analysis; Efficiency; Electric vehicles; Houses; Linear programming; Lithium-ion batteries; Battery degradation; Battery energy storage systems; Bidirectional power flow; Charging scheme; Computationally efficient; Electric vehicle charging; Operating expense; Techno-Economic analysis; Charging (batteries)","Englberger, S.; Institute for Electrical Energy Storage Technology, Technical University of Munich (TUM), Arcisstr. 21, Germany; email: stefan.englberger@tum.de",,"MDPI AG",19961073,,,,"English","Energies",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85063054309

Such an energy supply model might be particularly interesting for settlements located in rural areas where enough space is available for energy generation installations.

High-resolution reanalysis data are used to calculate necessary system sizes over a large area by simultaneously accounting for the temporal variability of renewable energy. For every potential location in the research area, the hybrid system requirements for clusters of 50 self-sufficient single-family houses are calculated. The results indicate no general trend regarding the size of the respective technologies, although larger areas where PV-wind power complementarity enables lowering the total system costs and required storage capacities were determined. Assuming that the cluster of households could be constituted and depending on the location, the total installation and operation costs for the proposed systems for a lifetime of 20 years range between EUR 1.8 Million and EUR 5 Million without considering costs of financing.

The performance of building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) modules varies depending upon the orientation and azimuth angle of the building. In this work, the year-round performance and economic feasibility analysis of grid-connected building-integrated photovoltaic (GBIPV) modules is reported for the hot and humid climatic regional condition at Kovilpatti (9°10′0′′N, 77°52′0′′E), Tamil Nadu, India. The appropriate mounting structures are provided, to experimentally simulate the performance of GBIPV modules at various orientations and inclination angles (0° to 90°). The result indicated that the optimum orientation for installation of BIPV modules in the façade and walls is found to be east while that for a pitched roof south orientation is recommended. The overall average annual performance ratio, capacity utilisation factor, array capture loss and system losses are found to be 0.83, 23%, 0.07 (h/day), and 0.17 (h/day), respectively. In addition, the economic feasibility of grid connected PV system for residential buildings in Tamil Nadu, India is analysed using HOMER by incorporating both a net metering process and electricity tariff. Practical application: Grid-connected building-integrated photovoltaic system has many benefits and barriers by being installed and integrated into the building structure. The application of GBIPV in building structures and its orientation of installation needs to be optimised before installing into buildings. This study will assist architects and wider community to design buildings facades and roofs with GBIPV system which are more aesthetic and account for noise protection and thermal insulation in the region of equatorial climate zones. By adding as shading devices, they can reduce the need for artificial lighting, and moderate heating or cooling load of the buildings. © The Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers 2019.","BIPV; Building integrated photovoltaic; grid-connected; HOMER; net metering; performance ratio","Architectural design; Economic analysis; Housing; Incident solar radiation; Photovoltaic cells; Roofs; Solar power generation; Thermal insulation; BIPV; Building integrated photovoltaic; Grid-connected; HOMER; Net metering; Performance ratio; Photovoltaic effects","Karthick, A.; Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, KPR Institute of Engineering and TechnologyIndia; email: karthick.power@gmail.com",,"SAGE Publications Ltd",01436244,,BSETD,,"English","Build Serv Eng Res Technol",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85076544403

To explore this question, a small-scale domestic PV system for South Africa (20-year lifetime) to deliver 1.42 kWh electricity from batteries overnight with 10-h discharge was costed with various Li-ion, Pb-acid and Aquion aqueous hybrid ion batteries (AHIBs). Environmental impact; compatibility with circular economy; potential for cost-reduction through lifetime extension; and valorisation of batteries at end-of-life is discussed. Batteries are 81–93% of system costs, and battery production required over the system lifetime would emit 743, 674 and 6060 kg CO2-eq (Pb-acid, Li-ion and AHIBs respectively). Hazardous materials in Li-ion and Pb-acid batteries pose risks at end-of-life. Li-ion and AHIBs face potential resource supply constraints due to use of Co, Li and graphite. Closed-loop recycling and refurbishment of Pb-acid batteries is well established in South Africa. Currently, no African facilities for Li-ion or AHIB recycling exist, with little opportunity to retain material value from these batteries within the region. Despite lower efficiencies and shorter lifetimes, Pb-acid batteries, which are readily available from domestic manufacturing at low cost, are the current best choice for sustainable small-scale domestic PV systems in South Africa. © 2018 The Authors","Africa; Batteries; Circular economy; Critical materials; End-of-life; Solar energy","Cost reduction; Electric energy storage; Electronic Waste; Environmental impact; Ions; Lithium-ion batteries; Recycling; Solar cells; Solar energy; Strategic materials; Africa; Battery production; Circular economy; Domestic manufacturing; End of lives; Potential resources; Sub-saharan africa; Sustainable energy; Lead acid batteries; alternative energy; carbon dioxide; comparative study; cost analysis; electricity; electrification; energy storage; equipment; manufacturing; photovoltaic system; refurbishment; rural area; solar power; Sub-Saharan Africa","Charles, R.G.; SPECIFIC, Materials Research Centre, College of Engineering, Swansea UniversityUnited Kingdom; email: r.charles@swansea.ac.uk",,"Elsevier Ltd",03605442,,ENEYD,,"English","Energy",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85057158339

This paper aims at investigating how residential photovoltaic (PV)-battery systems are operated, given different assumed incentives, and whether or not a prosumer induced operational pattern differs from what is desirable from a total electricity system point of view. The work combines a household optimization model that minimizes the annual household electricity bill for two price zones in southern Sweden with a dispatch model for the northern European electricity supply system. The results show significant differences in the charging and discharging patterns of residential batteries. A household annual electricity cost minimization gives many hours in which only a fraction of the battery capacity is used for charging and discharging, mainly driven by incentives to maximize self-consumption of PV-generated electricity. In contrast, in a total electricity system operational cost minimization larger fractions of the available battery capacity are utilized within single hours. In the total system optimization case, the batteries are charged and discharged less frequently and the energy turnover in the batteries is only half that of the household optimization case. For all the cases studied, the hourly electricity price provides only a limited incentive for households to operate their batteries in a system-optimal manner. © 2019 Heinisch, Odenberger, Göransson and Johnsson.","Electricity system dispatch modeling; Household electricity cost optimization; Prosumer load profiles; Residential PV-battery systems; Storage system operation; Techno-economic modeling","Charging (batteries); Costs; Housing; Secondary batteries; Battery systems; Electricity costs; Electricity system; Load profiles; Storage systems; Techno-economic model; Electric load dispatching","Heinisch, V.; Division of Energy Technology, Chalmers University of TechnologySweden; email: verena.heinisch@chalmers.se",,"Frontiers Media S.A.",2296598X,,,,"English","Front.

Regarding the high potential of renewable energies in Zahedan and Zanjan cities of Iran, implementing hybrid energy systems could be feasible for producing electrical energy as a correct policy and a good vision by policymakers and energy experts in the future. In this respect, a PV-Wind-Generator system is investigated in this paper for producing electricity in the two mentioned cities. Technical analysis of the solar energy for Zahedan is showing that the total amount of electricity production by the hybrid system is about 40,617 kWh/yr. In addition, the total amount of electricity production by this hybrid system for Zanjan is to equal 41,728 kWh/yr. Therefore, regarding this high potential of energy in these areas, investment on the solar energy for both cities has economic justification, while from the wind energy potential viewpoint, only Zahedan is proper for investment. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","energy sustainability; homer software; hybrid system; Renewable energy; SDGs","Economic analysis; Electric power generation; Hybrid systems; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Sustainable development; Wind power; Economic justification; Electricity production; Energy sustainability; Homer softwares; Renewable energies; SDGs; Techno-Economic analysis; Wind generator systems; Investments","Davarpanah, A.; Department of Mathematics, Aberystwyth UniversityUnited Kingdom; email: afshindpe@gmail.com",,"Taylor and Francis Inc.",15567036,,,,"English","Energy Sources Recovery Util.

This paper examines how a common characteristic of social networks, known as network segregation, can dampen the indirect benefits of solar incentive programs that arise from peer effects. Peer effects cause an agent to be more likely to adopt a technology if they are socially connected to other adopters. Due to network segregation, programs that target relatively affluent agents can generate rapid increases in overall adoption levels but at the cost of increasing disparities in access to solar technology between rich and poor communities. These dynamics are explored through theoretical agent-based models of solar adoption within hypothetical social systems. The effectiveness of three types of solar incentive programs, the feed-in tariff, leasing programs, and seeding programs, is explored. Even though these programs promote rapid adoption in the short term, results demonstrate that network segregation can create serious distributional justice problems in the long term for some programs. The distributional justice effects are particularly severe with the feed-in tariff. Overall, this paper provides an illustration of how agent-based models may be used to evaluate and experiment with policy interventions in a virtual space, which enhances the scientific basis of policymaking. © 2019 Heike I.

This study addresses the lack of studies on automation and control of systems that produce electricity, heating, cooling, and potable water. Mixed integer linear programming (MILP) optimization of the annualized total cost is used to select and size the plant components. The final layout consists of solar photovoltaic (PV) and thermal, an absorption chiller and a multi-effect desalination for electricity, heating, cooling and water, respectively. As auxiliary sources, boiler, gas turbine and grid connection are present. Storage units for electricity, heating, and water are also included in the proposed layout. The control and automation system are implemented using ladder logic. Sufficient supply, efficient resource use, financial gain, and real-world factors such as equipment degradation and response delay are considered in the control scheme design. Applying the methodology to a mixed industrial, commercial and residential zone in Southern Luzon, Philippines, the simulation results show successful implementation of all control scenarios.

Therefore, sector coupling, for example by using heat pump systems, is mandatory. Integrated homes use photovoltaic energy for space heating and domestic hot water to contribute to the decarbonization of the heating sector. The economics are a key to increasing the market penetration of integrated homes. Combined operation strategies for the electricity sector as well as for the heating sector can enhance the economics of these systems. This paper analyses different operation strategies for both electrical and thermal systems and examines the gain in efficiency by combined strategies. Furthermore, the dimensioning of the different system components heavily influences the economics of the integrated home. Capital-intensive components, such as photovoltaic generators, battery storage systems, heat pumps, and thermal storage units, play a major role for the profitability. Therefore, the optimization of component sizing is necessary in order to enhance the economics of the system. This paper presents optimization results based on the covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy. The results of the paper indicate that combined operation strategies as well as the optimization of the component sizes strongly influence the economics of photovoltaic battery energy storage systems with power-to-heat coupling. The impact of the optimization on the economic efficiency is higher compared to the influence of advanced combined operation strategies. The optimization indicates that relatively small storage units are more economical. The use of the heating sector as additional storage for excess photovoltaic energy is only economical to a minor degree, because it reduces the coefficient of performance of the heat pump. © 2019 The Authors","Battery energy storage systems; Integrated homes; Optimization; Photovoltaics; Power-to-heat coupling","Coefficient of performance; Covariance matrix; Economic and social effects; Electric batteries; Electric industry; Heat pump systems; Heat storage; Heating; Housing; Optimization; Photovoltaic cells; Pumps; Battery energy storage systems; Battery storage system; Covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategies; Heat coupling; Integrated homes; Optimization of components; Photovoltaics; Residential photovoltaic; Battery storage","Angenendt, G.; Chair of Electrochemical Energy Conversion and Storage Systems, Institute for Power Electronics and Electrical Drives (ISEA), RWTH Aachen UniversityGermany; email: georg.angenendt@isea.rwth-aachen.de",,"Elsevier Ltd",25901745,,,,"English","Energy Convers.

This review focuses on the pivotal role of waste biomass in creating residential buildings, including a smart system, which provides a union between who treats organic wastes and who transforms them into energy, contributing to improve a sustainable ecosystem as an efficient resource in order to contain energy consumption. According to European Directive 2009/28/EC, this essay highlights the way to create a self-sufficient residential building, powered with both a photovoltaic system and a biomass power plant. The synergy between the systems is guaranteed by the partnership of two Sicilian firms: F.E. R S.r.l., which operates in designing and incentivising Renewable Energy Sources, particularly in the photovoltaic solar power sector, and EcoHouse Immobiliare, which realizes sustainable residential buildings. Both of them are able to assure a low cost waste disposal and a cost amortization too. This project develops a way to generate energy with solar power and biomass resources, contributing to provide a sustainable development via the construction of Nearly Zero Energy Buildings. By the way, the present research shows how biomass energy in the construction of residential buildings has several economic and environmental advantages, such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions and minimizing the dependence on non-renewable energy resources. Moreover, due this analysis it is possible to underline the reduction of disposal costs and the fulfilment of the connected environmental benefits and decrease in costs. © 2019 National Society of Environmental Science and Engineering (SNSIM).","Mmc (modern methods of construction); Nzebs (nearly zero energy buildings); RES (renewable energy sources); Solar panel efficiency; Waste biomass",,"Tuccio, G.; University of Catania, Department of Economics and Business, 55 Corso Italia, Italy; email: giovannatuccio.gt@gmail.com",,"National Society of Environmental Science and Engineering (SNSIM)",23929537,,,,"English","Procedia Environ.

Meanwhile, energy supply increased by 6.1% from 1991 to 2006. If energy consumption continues to increase, it will put significant strain on the energy supply. The steady growth of electricity consumption in Malaysia is directly linked to CO2 emissions and climate change, which directly increases annual temperature and temperature-related health problems. The development of a low-carbon society is important as Malaysia is experiencing increasing CO2 emissions. A low-carbon society aims to reduce CO2 and improve life. The use of PV solar energy can be an effective solution, but Malaysian households face several barriers to using solar energy in their homes, such as high price, lack of physical and financial means, in addition to a lack of awareness and social support. This study proposes a model that will benefit from PV solar panels with Shariah-compliant equity-based crowd financing. In this study, electricity usage and energy usage of households, their interest in solar energy and the obstacles they encounter in the use of solar energy are discussed. A total of 260 participants from Kuala Lumpur were surveyed. The majority of respondents (74%) claimed that electricity usage was between 0-3000 KWh. The findings of this study show that high initial costs, limited knowledge of renewable energy technologies, lack of the best possible price, and lack of awareness are the biggest obstacles to sustainable renewable energy development. Besides, 47% of respondents were willing to accept the proposed model to help them in using solar energy in their homes. Furthermore, a logit model was estimated to investigate the factors that may affect the willingness of the households to accept the model. The results of the logit model reveal that income, household size and knowledge about climate change affect significantly and positively the willingness of the households to accept the model. This study suggests that the government can take the initiative to raise awareness of the households about the need for renewable energy and low-carbon consumer society. © 2019, Malaysian Consumer and Family Economics Association.

Economic benefits are crucial for residents to accept LCZEBs. However, few relevant case studies have been conducted. A comparative analysis between a NZEB and a LCZEB with a multi-story apartment in a temperate region that meets the requirements of local building energy codes as the reference building was conducted in this study to ascertain economic feasibility of LCZEB. First, a building model and an energy model were established on the basis of site test, survey, and monitoring data. Then, the energy balances of the NZEB and LCZEB were calculated on the basis of the results of energy simulation and the foregoing data. Finally, the LCZEB and NZEB were realized on the condition that high thermal performance materials and high energy efficiency building equipment were adopted in accordance with the principle of maximizing net present value (NPV) and solar energy was fully utilized. Results demonstrate that solar hot water and photovoltaic systems are critical to the NZEB and LCZEB. Annual net energy (ANE) and annual NPV per square meter of thermal collector are −571.11 kWh and $455.5, respectively, and ANE and annual NPV per square meter of photovoltaic panel are −115.62 kWh and $13.2. The NZEB and LCZEB are economically feasible in the temperate region although the NZEB is superior to the LCZEB in terms of economic benefits. Their NPVs for the calculation period (20 years) are $15369.64 and $4718.77, and their payback periods are 11 and 16 years.

However, not all installations are equally profitable. The objective of this paper is to analyze the economic performance of residential self-consumption systems, and, in particular, the effect of electric load profiles on that performance. For this, a simulation model is proposed that allows a comparative analysis of the profitability of different configurations of a residential solar system connected to the grid. The model is applied to several differentiated load profiles, as well as to different configurations of photovoltaic panels and batteries. The analysis shows the impact of different load profiles on self-consumption, autarky and, ultimately, the grid parity of the installation. © 2019 Publicaciones Dyna Sl.

The paper presents a study to evaluate the effects of retrofit scenarios on energy performance of residential buildings with emphasize on the relation of retrofit actions and morphological characteristics, location and layout of these buildings. The parametric analysis of retrofit actions is executed for two building types with different conditions including a single-family house and an apartment, representing considerable part of existing residential fabrics in Yazd. This research proposes a retrofit plan implementing two strategies to balance the energy demand and supply of models by minimizing the annual energy demand and providing electricity by photovoltaic systems. This suggested retrofit plan incorporates three components of a comprehensive retrofit project: building envelope, systems and technologies, and application of renewable energies. The evaluation of demand and supply in balance analysis indicates that significant reduction in energy can be achieved (up to 36%) and total electricity generation is increased up to 9.25% in certain models by application of proposed retrofit scenarios.

To that end, Saudi Arabia has been chosen for this case study. Over a project lifetime of 25 years, we find that, contrary to the widely accepted norm of 50% being a reasonable MSOC, a lower MSOC can bestow economic benefits. For example, a MSOC of 20% results in a lower number of batteries required throughout the lifetime of the project-while still meeting demand. For a village of 1000 homes, this translates to a saving of $47 million in net present value. Further, incorporating temperature effects results in deducing more realistic costs that are 125% higher than the ideal scenario (i.e., when temperature is not modeled). This difference stems from underestimating the actual number of batteries needed throughout the project lifetime. Compared to a diesel-powered microgrid, and for a village of 1000 homes, a PVB would, on an annual basis, avoid emitting 5000 tons of carbon and avoid burning 2 million liters of diesel. © 2019 by the authors.","Battery; Diesel; Microgrid; Solar photovoltaics; State-of-charge; Storage","diesel; equipment; photovoltaic system; solar power; temperature effect; village; Saudi Arabia","Elshurafa, A.M.; King Abdullah Petroleum Studies and Research Center (KAPSARC)Saudi Arabia; email: amro.elshurafa@kapsarc.org",,"MDPI AG",20711050,,,,"English","Sustainability",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85069869573

The techno-economic performance of grid-connected PV system in the five regions was evaluated using the HOMER software. Monthly average electric production, economic and environmental considerations, and sensitivity analyses were all considered. The results show that the pollutants from grid-only, grid/PV, and grid/PV/battery systems come mainly in the form of CO2 emissions. In addition, this study concludes that grid/PV systems are technically, economically and environmentally feasible for all five climate zones. The excess electricity, NPC, and COE values of the grid/PV systems for all five climate zones increased with PV penetration increased, whereas the CO2 emissions for these climate zones decreased due to the increasing PV sizes. For the grid/PV systems of five climate zones, Kunming is the most economical with the least NPC ($113,382) and COE ($0.073/kWh). The lowest CO2 (38,975 kg/yr), SO2 (35.4 kg/yr), and NOx (165 kg/yr) emissions of grid/PV systems occurred in Kunming.

As the residential sector is the largest consumer of electricity in Oman, we develop a novel approach, using houses in Muscat as a case study, to assess the potential of implementing roof-top solar PV/battery technologies, that operate without recourse to the electricity grid. Such systems target the complete decarbonisation of electricity demand per household and are defined in this study as grid-independent systems. The approach adopted starts with a technical assessment of grid-independent systems that evaluates the characteristics of the solar panel and the battery facility required to provide grid-independence. This is then compared to a similar grid-connected system and any techno-economic targets necessary to enhance the feasibility of residential roof-top PV systems in Muscat are identified. Such an analysis was achieved through developing a detailed techno-economic mathematical model describing four sub-systems; the solar panel DC source, the grid-independent sub-system, the grid-connected sub-system and the economic sub-system. The model was implemented in gPROMS and uses real hourly weather and climate conditions matched with real demand data, over a simulated period of 20 years. The results indicate that, in the context of the system studied, grid-independent PV systems are not feasible.

The charging/discharging schedules are first optimized by EV owners/users, and then adjusted by the local EV dispatcher as final schedules. Specifically, an EV charging/discharging optimization model is first built with objectives of minimizing the charging cost and maximizing the discharging profit. Then, a dispatching model is presented for the local EV operator to enhance the local accommodation capability for PV power outputs. On the basis of the dispatching result of the local EV dispatcher and the on-line updated load profile in the distribution system concerned, a dynamic TOU tariff updating strategy is presented. FinHy, On the basis of the EV arival time, departure time and charging demands generated by the weel-established Monte Carlo simulation method, a distribution system with 3 residential communities is employed to demonstrate the eefectivenees of the proposed method. © 2018 State Power Economic Research Institute.

The emission reduction from GSHP depends on the carbon intensity of the electricity generation mix. Moreover, grid capacity may be limiting the introduction of these high-electricity demand GSHP systems. Photovoltaics (PV) systems help to provide additional emission reductions for residential GSHP systems. Battery energy storage systems can reduce the peak demand and allow for more GSHPs within the low voltage grid. We developed a techno-economic and environmental assessment model to quantify this impact of PV and batteries combined with residential GSHP systems. Measured demand data of 16 dwellings with GSHP and PV systems from the Netherlands were used. We show that PV can provide around 19% of the GSHP demand, while batteries enhance this by 50% and reduce the peak demand by 45%. Greenhouse gas emission of a GSHP with PV is reduced on average with 73 tCO2-eq, corresponding to a 80% reduction, over a 30-year lifetime. Dwellings with only a GSHP system have a net present values increase of around € 275 per tCO2-eq of avoided emission. This is reduced to € 230 per tCO2-eq when PV and storage is added to the system. Nevertheless, investment in GSHP systems today is not economically attractive for many dwellings. A sensitivity analysis showed that policies should focus on increasing natural gas tariffs, carbon taxation, investment subsidies or combinations of these routes to encourage sustainable heating. © 2018 The Authors","Avoided emissions; Ground source heat pump; Investment attractiveness; PV-battery systems; Residential dwellings; Self-consumption","Battery storage; Carbon; Digital storage; Electric batteries; Emission control; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Housing; Investments; Pumps; Sensitivity analysis; Taxation; Avoided emissions; Battery systems; Investment attractiveness; Residential dwelling; Self- consumption; Geothermal heat pumps","Litjens, G.B.M.A.; Copernicus Institute of Sustainable Development, Utrecht University, PO Box 80.115, Netherlands; email: g.b.m.a.litjens@uu.nl",,"Elsevier Ltd",03787788,,ENEBD,,"English","Energy Build.",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85054358932

The utilization of renewable energy technologies for off-grid electricity generation has become an attractive option for minimizing the concerns of global warming and continuous depletion of fossil fuels. This work aims to study the techno-economic and environmental feasibility of using a PV/diesel/battery hybrid energy system to supply electricity for a remote rural village in Iraq. HOMER software is utilized to evaluate the optimization and the sensitivity analysis using a multi-input module by considering the effect of components degradation, load growth, and fuel price fluctuations on the performance of the system during the project lifetime. Results indicate that the most economical combination consists of a 12 kW PV, a diesel generator with a capacity of 20 kW, 15 batteries and a 6 kW power converter, at a net present cost of $ 162703. Moreover, the multi-year input variations have a considerable influence on system performance. The batteries show degradation of 24.2% by the end of their lifetime. Furthermore, among the project lifetime, PV production is reduced by 10% whilst diesel production is increased by 25.6% thereby increasing CO2 emission by 23.1%. Likewise, the sensitivity analysis on ambient temperature demonstrates that the PV and batteries are highly affected by temperature increment, which increases the annual output energy of batteries from 5496 kWh to 5871 kWh whilst reducing the lifetime of batteries from 26.5 months to 23.5 months and the annual PV production from 18268 kWh to 17332 kWh, which generally affects the economic performance of the system negatively. © 2018 International Journal of Renewable Energy Research.","Diesel; Hybrid; Multi-year; Net present cost; Rural areas; Solar",,"Aziz, A.S.; School of Electrical Systems Engineering, Universiti Malaysia PerlisMalaysia; email: iraq_1991@yahoo.com",,"International Journal of Renewable Energy Research",13090127,,,,"English","Int.

Net- Metering scheme includes two main items that have a negative effect on the economics of the PV system. The first item is represented in monthly subtraction of 25% of the excess PV energy, as compensation for utilizing the electric grid and the second one is striking off the excess PV energy at the end of each year instead of carrying it forward to following year. Economic analysis of PV grid connected system certifies that Net-Metering reduces the income of the PV system and therefore does not encourage expanding the use of PV systems. Considering Net- Metering, a PV system of 5 kWp with an annual yield of 8686 kWh installed on a house with an annual consumption of 6984 kWh, 19% of total annual PV energy generated will not be credited which results in a net present value of 5126 $, an internal rate of return of 17.3% and a payback period of 7.6 years. On the other hand, the same analysis were used to evaluate the same system with Feed-in Tariff, where the total annual PV energy will be credited, the results were 7991 $, 22% and 5.7 year respectively. Moreover, the performed analyses show that the Net- Metering is sensitive to load profile variation even at constant annual energy load.

However, the performance of renewable energy resource (RER) based generators in a microgrid is hindered by their intermittent nature. The energy storage system plays a key role in overcoming the intermittency of renewable sources by balancing the power demand against variable generation. Energy storage using batteries is accepted as one of the most important and efficient ways for retaining reliable energy supply whilst incorporating RERs into the electricity grid. Lead-acid (LA) batteries have been the most commonly used electrochemical energy storage technology for grid-based applications till date, but many other competing technologies are also being used such as lithium-ion (Li-ion), Sodium-Sulphur and flow batteries. This paper carries out the techno-economic analysis of the battery storage system under different configurations of the microgrid system. The design of an optimal model of standalone as well as grid-connected microgrid systems having PV-wind-diesel and biodiesel energy resources in the presence of Li-ion (LiFeSO4 type) and LA batteries have been studied. The performance of the two types of batteries has been compared in the proposed microgrid systems considering realistic load profiles, real resource data, and real prices of the components. Load profiles of two rural villages, a business organization and an urban residential building have been used. On the basis of these load profiles and available resources, different microgrid configurations with generation from PV, wind turbine, diesel and biodiesel generators have been considered to study the performances of the batteries. The results include the cost of optimal system configuration under the given scenarios, electricity generation by various generating sources, detail comparison between various components, emissions, and various batteries performance assessment parameters. The study reveals that Li-ion batteries as energy storage are techno-economically more viable compared to LA batteries and they are expected to play a significant role in various applications of future electric power systems. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Battery; HOMER; Microgrid; Optimization; Solar; Wind","Biodiesel; Digital storage; Economic analysis; Electric power system economics; Electric power systems; Ions; Iron compounds; Lead acid batteries; Lithium compounds; Lithium-ion batteries; Optimization; Renewable energy resources; Wind; Wind turbines; Battery; Electrochemical energy storage; HOMER; Micro grid; Optimal system configuration; Renewable energy resource (RER); Solar; Urban residential buildings; Battery storage","Dhundhara, S.; Department of Electrical & Electronics Engineering, UIET, Panjab UniversityIndia; email: sandeep08@pu.ac.in",,"Elsevier Ltd",01968904,,ECMAD,,"English","Energy Convers.

Therefore, this study focuses on how to address the identified problem so that the healthcare centers or clinics in the remote areas can provide timely delivery of medical services for the concerned people. This paper, then, presents the analysis of stand-alone hybrid renewable energy systems for basic healthcare services in the rural areas, where there is no grid energy supply or the supply from the existing grid is erratic and unreliable. One major factor that informs the selection of the hybrid energy system in this study is that it promises high reliability compared to a single energy system. The research presents a statistical analysis of the potential of wind and solar energies for a selected rural locations in Nigeria based on the available long-term hourly and daily meteorological data. It employs an optimal technical and economic design and sizing of hybrid electrical power systems’ components such as the wind, PV, battery and inverter systems, using the hybrid optimisation software (HOMER). Results show that Sokoto and Jos sites exist in the high wind potential regions, while the remaining sites are only suitable for small wind applications. Values obtained for global radiation show that all the sites enjoy considerable solar energy potential suitable for varying degree of solar energy applications. PV/wind/diesel/battery hybrid system configuration is considered optimum for rural health center at Iseyin, Sokoto, Maiduguri, Jos and Enugu, while hybrid systems involving PV/diesel/battery is considered ideal for Port-Harcourt, due to the quality of renewable energy potential.

We used an experimentally validated building simulation model to evaluate various electrically-powered and commercially-available HVAC technologies. The HVAC accounted for 23.8% to 72.9% of the total building energy depending on the HVAC option and climate zone. Each HVAC configuration was paired with a PV system sized to exactly reach the net-zero energy target, so the economics were compared based on the initial PV + HVAC cost. Mechanical ventilation was considered with and without heat recovery; the heat recovery ventilator (HRV) saved a significant amount of energy in cold winter months and hot summer months, and the energy recovery ventilator (ERV) provided additional benefit for humid zones. The HRV was cost-effective in the cold northern latitudes of Chicago, Minneapolis, Helena, and Duluth, where energy savings reached 17.3% to 19.7%. In other climates, ventilation without recovery was more cost effective, by 1% to 9%, and sometimes even more energy efficient. The ERV was never the lowest cost option. A ground-source heat pump (GSHP) and an air-source heat pump (ASHP) were compared, with the GSHP providing significant energy savings, 24.3% to 39.2%, in heating-dominated climates (Chicago through Duluth). In warmer climates, the GSHP saved little energy or used more energy than the ASHP. The PV + HVAC cost was lower everywhere with the ASHP, though it is possible for colder climates that a carefully sized GSHP and ground loop could be cost-competitive. The energy and cost data as well as the required PV capacity could guide HVAC and PV designs for residential NZEBs in different climate zones. © 2018","Climate zone; Ground-source heat pump; Heat recovery; HVAC; Initial cost; Net-zero energy building","Air conditioning; Air source heat pumps; Cost effectiveness; Energy conservation; Energy efficiency; Geothermal heat pumps; Housing; Intelligent buildings; Pumps; Ventilation; Waste heat; Waste heat utilization; Building simulation model; Energy performance; Groundsource heat pump (GSHP); Heating , Ventilating , and Air-Conditioning; HVAC; Initial costs; Mechanical ventilation; Northern latitudes; Zero energy buildings","Skye, H.M.; National Institute of Standards and TechnologyUnited States; email: harrison.skye@nist.gov",,"Elsevier Ltd",01968904,,ECMAD,,"English","Energy Convers.

Hence to develop a power system model for sustainable and efficient power deliverance is inevitable. To serve the purpose, we proposed in this paper a hybrid renewable energy system (HRES) that consists of run-off canal micro hydro/PV/wind integrated with a diesel generator. Main purpose is the electrification of remote areas of province Punjab, Pakistan. The authors selected the BS link canal-I located at 300 52' N and 730 55' E in Punjab, Pakistan, for the proposed HRES. Beforehand, load and resource profile of selected site was evaluated to present an economically optimized model of the proposed energy system. Moreover, Hybrid Optimization Model for Electric Renewables (HOMER) was used as an optimization tool to perform techno-economic feasibility of the micro hydro/PV/wind energy system to entertain the evaluated load of the location. Mainly three strategies are employed due to scarcity of hydro resources and based on the availability of the energy resources. First strategy suggests to use diesel generator integrated with solar and wind power systems, HOMER declares this strategy most expensive with total Net Present Cost (NPC) of $ 670,121 and Cost of Energy (COE) of $ 0.0936/kWh. The recovery period of the hybrid energy system under this strategy is 13 years. The second strategy focuses on the water management strategy using 100 % renewable energy.

The Energy Services Delivery Project (ESDP) in Sri Lanka was an exemplary renewable energy access program, successfully installing 21,000 off-grid SHSs alongside grid-connected mini-hydro capacity and off-grid village hydroelectric systems. It reached all of its targets ahead of schedule and below cost. By contrast, the Indonesia Solar Home System Project (ISHSP), which ran from 1997 to 2003, sought to reach one million rural Indonesians through the sales and installation of 200,000 SHSs. However, by project closing in 2003, less than five percent of the original sales target, or only 8054 units, had been installed. The ESDP and ISHSP were the World Bank's first foray into a “market-based renewable energy services provision model.” Based on original research interviews and field observation, the article finds that contrasting the two programs—one a success, the other a failure—offers lessons for energy and development practitioners, namely that effective programs are those that select appropriate technology, often with input from households themselves; they promote community participation and ownership; and they have robust marketing, demonstration, and promotion activities. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Electrification; Energy poverty; Energy security; Rural energy use; Solar home system; Solar photovoltaic (PV) panels","Commerce; Electric utilities; Energy policy; Energy security; Energy utilization; Renewable energy resources; Solar power generation; Electrification; Energy poverties; Rural energy; Solar home system; Solar photovoltaics; Solar buildings; alternative energy; electrification; photovoltaic system; political economy; rural energy; service provision; solar power; World Bank; Indonesia; Sri Lanka","Sovacool, B.K.; Science Policy Research Unit (SPRU), University of Sussex, Jubilee Building, Room 367, Falmer, United Kingdom; email: B.Sovacool@sussex.ac.uk",,"Elsevier Ltd",03014215,,ENPYA,,"English","Energy Policy",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85053796180

However, ‘energy storage’ encompasses a family of technologies, each with its own set of performance, cost and physical characteristics, at different stages of development. At the same time, each energy system – however defined – has specific needs; and energy systems are themselves part of a wider socio-technical system which has aims beyond the confines of the energy ‘trilemma’. As energy storage technologies develop, funding is becoming available to demonstrate their application in realistic environments. However, with multiple technical and non-technical factors to consider, it is challenging for many decision makers who often have limited expertise and resources to select which projects to support. In this paper we first describe a novel framework for assessing the wider benefits that could come from deploying energy storage using Multi-Attribute Value Theory (MAVT), a form of Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis. We then use the framework to assess six potential energy storage projects through a combination of technical analysis and stakeholder input in the county of Cornwall in the UK: a region that has good solar and wind resource with relatively low demand and constrained network infrastructure. The projects assessed were: power to gas, a distributed battery system, battery storage integrated with solar PV and demand from Cornwall Airport Newquay, liquid air energy storage, battery storage integrated with wave energy, and thermal energy storage at a new residential development. We conclude that MAVT can provide a straightforward and user-friendly approach, which can be easily used by decision makers for assessing energy storage projects across a range of criteria and promoting engagement with stakeholders. This approach also allows the subjectivity of decision-making, a potential limitation, to be explored through a sensitivity analysis. The use of MAVT can lead to important insights for the development of energy systems, which in this study included the importance of local priorities to decision-making. In this case, battery storage with PV and demand from Cornwall Airport Newquay was the top-ranking project, performing well across a range of attributes including the maturity of the technology, its ability to defer grid upgrades and economic viability. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Energy storage; Energy system planning; Multi-attribute value theory; Multi-criteria decision analysis","Decision making; Decision theory; Electric batteries; Energy storage; Heat storage; Liquefied gases; Potential energy; Sensitivity analysis; Wave energy conversion; Wind power; Energy storage technologies; Energy systems; Multi-attribute value theories; Multi-criteria decision analysis; Physical characteristics; Realistic environments; Renewable energy generation; Residential development; Battery storage; alternative energy; analytical framework; assessment method; decision making; energy planning; energy storage; multicriteria analysis; potential energy; stakeholder; Cornwall [England]; Cornwall [England]; England; Newquay; United Kingdom","Murrant, D.; Birmingham Centre for Energy Storage, School of Chemical Engineering, University of Birmingham, Edgbaston, United Kingdom; email: d.murrant@bham.ac.uk",,"Elsevier Ltd",03062619,,APEND,,"English","Appl.

In this paper, models and methods which can handle three-phase unbalanced scenarios are developed. The authors present a novel three-phase home energy management system to control both active and reactive power to provide per-phase optimization. Simplified single-phase algorithms are not sufficient to capture all the complexities a three-phase unbalance system poses. Distributed generators such as photo-voltaic systems, wind generators, and loads such as household electric and thermal demand connected to these networks directly depend on external factors such as weather, ambient temperature, and irradiation. They are also time dependent, containing daily, weekly, and seasonal cycles. Economic and phase-balanced operation of such generators and loads is very important to improve energy efficiency and maximize benefit while respecting consumer needs. Since homes and buildings are expected to consume a large share of electrical energy of a country, they are the ideal candidate to help solve these issues. The method developed will include typical distributed generation, loads, and various smart home models which were constructed using realistic models representing typical homes in Austria.

These new regulations allow residential consumers to become micro and mini-generators; this scenario institutes an overall change to the behavior of the energy distribution system (DS). The loads now tend toward a bidirectional flow, producing change in the energy profile, this occurs mainly during the day due to photovoltaic penetration. In this context, one notes the introduction of Electrical Energy Storages (EES), which has as its prime objective to aid distribution systems in their control of these new variables.

In order to reach this goal, a technical analysis was performed that tested 4 case studies, considering variable demand, with distributed and concentrated EES.

The small quantity of platinum in the filaments of used thermocouples, thousands of which are discarded each year by metal foundries, can be economically recovered by conversion to chloroplatinic acid hydrate, an ‘added value’ product, which can then be used in the fabrication of dye-sensitized solar cell counter-electrodes. 91% recovery of platinum from filaments as chloroplatinic acid hydrate has been achieved by aqua regia digestion of manually isolated filaments. Cost-benefit analysis shows the proposed process derives sufficient value to cover landfill costs for what is left of the waste thermocouples after platinum removal; provide ∼5 days employment; and provide 63% materials cost savings for electrode preparation in comparison to purchasing commercially available chloroplatinic acid hydrate. The proposed local industrial symbiosis would, per year, divert ∼50 g of platinum from landfill, avoid up to 1400 kg of CO2 emissions associated with primary production of an equivalent quantity of platinum, and give enough platinum to produce catalytic electrodes for ∼500 m2 of dye-sensitized solar cells, which could supply clean energy for 12 homes in the locality. The process exemplifies the environmental, economic and social benefits available through adoption of circular practices, which make use of secondary materials available within the local economy by valorizing wastes.

Part of the attractiveness of investing in such systems stems from avoiding paying grid charges (GCs). Yet, the systems rely on the grid for PV feed-in and possibly contribute to PV grid integration challenges. Here, a bilevel optimization approach is developed to evaluate interdependencies between the DNO's decision of raising GCs and the reaction of PV BSS investors. The model allows DNOs to trade-off the effectiveness of different measures to foster PV grid integration and the danger of starting a self-reinforcing process, potentially leading to grid defection. Included are two case studies that show that the new equilibrium between DNO and PV BSSs comes at a price of raised GCs and larger PV system sizes. Yet, in either case study, grid defection is not a realistic scenario as the marginal value of additional self-supply decreases with higher GCs. Compared to PV curtailment by the DNO, or grid reinforcements, fixed feed-in limits and power-based GCs reduce oversizing of PV BSSs and provide an operational incentive for peak-oriented BSS operation. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Battery storage; Grid defection; Grid economics; Photovoltaics (PV); PV grid integration; Self-consumption","Data storage equipment; Decision making; Defects; Economic and social effects; Economics; Electric batteries; Housing; Reinforcement; Grid defection; Grid economics; Grid integration; Photovoltaics; Self- consumption; Battery storage; building; decision making; distribution system; economics; energy storage; energy use; model; optimization; photovoltaic system; residential energy; smart grid; strategic approach","von Appen, J.; Fraunhofer Institute for Energy Economics and Energy Systems Technology IEE, Königstor 59, Germany; email: jan.vonappen@iee.fraunhofer.de",,"Elsevier Ltd",03062619,,APEND,,"English","Appl.

In this regard, the construction of urban water systems that utilize renewable energy is important for safeguarding urban ecological environments while improving the aesthetic quality of residential areas. In this study, we examine a photovoltaic water lifting and pumping method to supplement an urban water system in Xiamen, China, with reclaimed water from a nearby sewage plant, which might serve as a water source during the dry season. We analyzed the current conditions for the planned water system in the Xiang'an District, Xiamen, as well as the requirements for maintaining a constant water supply to this system. This analysis illustrated the necessity for a water system that maintains the ecological balance in the area, and the necessary conditions for adopting the photovoltaic water-supply scheme as part of the Xiang'an water system. The sewage treatment plant in the Xiang'an District requires upgrades so that the standard of its reclaimed water complies with the Class IV water quality standard for post-treatment surface water. Furthermore, we analyzed water supply scenarios for the water system in the Xiang'an District based on the conditions in 2011, when the highest number of non-rainy days in the past ten years were recorded. Based on this analysis, we propose a photovoltaic water-supply scheme and describe the structure of a compatible photovoltaic water-pumping system scheme. The pump system includes three photovoltaic pump stations: one is the main pump station that operates throughout the year for water lifting, which utilizes a reclaimed water supply, while the other two are supplementary, and serve to increase the recirculation of water in the river, and operate when necessary during the dry season.

However, adopting renewable energy systems is still burdensome for the Maldives not only because of its high initial costs and insufficient financial resources but also because of a lack of understanding about whether the deployment of a renewable system is economically feasible. Therefore, the concept of grid parity is explored as an important concept in this paper to examine the possible timeframe for reaching it. A distinctive feature of the paper is that the paper used actual cost and technical information to analyze the levelized cost of energy (LCOEs) of the independent renewable system in a remote island and examined its timeframe for reaching the grid parity condition. Based on economic and technical information from a project for replacing existing diesel generator to photovoltaic (PV) with energy storage system (ESS) in Kuda Bandos Island in the Maldives, the paper considers three different system configurations and evaluates which configuration could result in the most optimal off-grid energy systems in this remote island. With sensitivity analysis on various uncertainties, the paper shows the range of the levelized costs of energy and the periods required for reaching grid parity for deploying solar photovoltaics and ESSs in Kuda Bandos Island, Maldives. The result indicates that the photovoltaic system is an economically feasible option for the resort, and that grid parity can be reached within the project lifetime. However, the result shows that the use of advanced ESSs is still an expensive option and would not be economically reasonable. © 2018 by the authors.","HOMER simulation; LCOE comparison; Levelized cost of energy; Photovoltaic with energy storage system; Sensitivity analysis","alternative energy; comparative study; cost analysis; economic conditions; energy storage; island; photovoltaic system; power generation; scenario analysis; sensitivity analysis; simulation; small island state; solar power; Maldives","Kim, D.; Graduate School of International Studies, Yonsei UniversitySouth Korea; email: dhkim2@yonsei.ac.kr",,"MDPI AG",20711050,,,,"English","Sustainability",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85055987901

The present work studies the impact of different retail rate mechanisms on bill savings of net metered consumers, with increasing solar penetration scenario. Seven different scenarios, based on increasing solar penetration in the energy mix, are designed. After simulating wholesale electricity prices through a unit commitment based energy system model, retail rates (two time-invariant and three time-variant) are designed using simulated electricity prices. To evaluate the impact of increasing PV penetration on consumer economics, the electricity bills of 97 net metered consumers are calculated using designed retail rates for all the scenarios. It is observed from the results, that the value of bill savings decreases with increasing PV penetration for all the retail rates.

Rising electricity prices and decreasing battery prices enhance the economics of residential battery storage. Intelligent operation strategies could further improve the economics and lead to grid relief as well. This paper presents new forecast-based operation strategies for increased battery lifetime and reduced curtailment of PV power feed-into enhance system economics. In addition, these strategies are compared to different commonly used operation strategies in terms of economics and self-sufficiency of the system. Increased battery lifetime is achieved by reducing the average state of charge of the battery by limiting the stored energy according to the predicted energy demand during night. Forecast-based operation strategies are used in combination with variable power feed-in limits of the PV battery storage system to relieve the grid. Two different forecast strategies are discussed: the perfect forecast, which is used as the best case, and the persistence forecast, representing the worst case in terms of forecast accuracy. The operation strategies are evaluated by simulating a DC-coupled PV and battery system. The model is parameterized with measured data from cell testing and battery aging tests. The levelized cost of electricity is used for the economic evaluation of the operation strategies. Results show that the developed forecast-based operation strategy can drastically increase battery lifetime and thus total energy throughput and therefore reduce the levelized cost of electricity by up to 12%. This has been shown effectively for two different types of battery cell, a low-cost consumer cell and a high-quality battery cell. The combination of forecast-based operation strategies with variable feed-in limits can nearly eliminate curtailed PV energy for the simulated system. Sensitivity analyses of component sizing and load profile confirm the findings. The developed strategy can easily be implemented on real residential PV battery energy storage systems since no additional communication interface is required. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Battery energy storage system; Lifetime enhancement; Operation strategies; PV home storage system; Self-consumption","Charging (batteries); Costs; Digital storage; Forecasting; Housing; Secondary batteries; Sensitivity analysis; Testing; Battery energy storage systems; Lifetime enhancement; Operation strategy; Self- consumption; Storage systems; Battery storage; cost analysis; electricity generation; energy storage; operations technology; photovoltaic system; self sufficiency; sensitivity analysis","Angenendt, G.; Chair for Electrochemical Energy Conversion and Storage Systems, Institute for Power Electronics and Electrical Drives (ISEA), RWTH Aachen UniversityGermany; email: georg.angenendt@isea.rwth-aachen.de",,"Elsevier Ltd",03062619,,APEND,,"English","Appl.

Essentially, we have derived the probability distribution of the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) for both PV and grid electricity. We have thus assessed how likely grid parity will occur with respect to system's nominal power and financing scheme in a net metering framework, by computing the cumulative probability for which the LCOE difference is nonnegative: P(ΔLCOE≥0). Regarding southern Brazil, it appears that economic viability of many residential grid-connected PV systems in operation is far from guaranteed, due to the need for substantial own capital and nominal capacity. 4-kW systems might be viable (P(ΔLCOE≥0)=0.82) but only by relying on equity financing, while small systems around 2kW will not (P(ΔLCOE≥0)≤0.3). When debt financing is considered however, merely systems with nominal capacity above 7kW present significant confidence levels (P(ΔLCOE≥0)>0.95).

Few studies have included the value of resilience when sizing PV and Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS), and none have included the cost to island a PV and BESS, grid-connected costs and benefits, and the value of resilience. This work presents a novel method for incorporating the value of resilience provided by a PV and BESS into a techno-economic optimization model. Including the value of resilience in the design of a cost-optimal PV and BESS generally increases the system capacities, and in some cases makes a system economical where it was not before. For example, for a large hotel in Anaheim, CA no system is economical without resilience valued; however, with a $5317/hr value of resilience a 363 kW and 60 kWh solar and BESS provides a net present value of $50,000. Lastly, we discuss the effect of the ”islandable premium” which must be balanced against the benefits from serving critical loads during outages.

This cost/kWh is compared with projected grid electricity prices at each location to determine parity dates. Analysis results reveal that grid parity is primarily a result of higher power prices or unreliable grids rather than declining microgrid costs. For Pakistan, grid parity is already here for microgrids, while Germany hits parity in the 2023–2040 timeframe. Results for South Africa and the US suggest that places with low grid prices hit parity after the year 2040.

The focus of the paper lies in evaluating the feasibility for the power system of solar power generation technologies to achieve a balance between energy generation and support costs in a more efficient way. The case study is based on a year-long time series of examples with an hourly resolution of electricity prices from the Nord Pool power market, in addition to the power demand and solar generation of Latvian prosumers. Electric energy generation and the consumption of big data from more than 100 clients were collected. Based on these data, we predict the processes for the next 25 years, and we estimate economic indicators using a detailed description of the net metering billing system and the Monte-Carlo method. A recommendation to change the current net system to a superior one, taking into account the market cost of energy, concludes the paper. © 2018 by the authors.

Next to an increasing spread between electricity prices and feed-in tariffs (FITs), the adoption of PV BSSs is fostered by a preference for higher self-sufficiency and a federal investment incentive for PV BSSs. Such an incentive subsidizes BSSs on the promise of facilitating PV grid integration. However, so far a comprehensive analysis of implications of self-sufficiency desire and investment incentive for PV BSS sizing and operation and their grid integration is missing. To enable the key stakeholders – PV BSS investors, distribution network operators and policy makers – to derive a better understanding of the underlying interdependencies between these drivers and the corresponding sizing and operation of PV BSSs, an optimization model is developed. The model includes all relevant cash flows for the business case of PV BSSs, e.g. surcharges on PV self-consumption, and an approach for adopting preferences for self-sufficiency. A case study-based analysis shows that the desire for self-sufficiency and the BSS investment incentive lead to larger PV systems. From a PV grid integration perspective, a grid-supporting BSS operation is contradicted by larger system sizes fostered by the investment incentive and self-sufficiency desires. Imposing stricter feed-in limits and adjusting the residential PV support mechanism entail chances to enable larger PV systems sizes while also limiting their grid impact. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Battery storage; Distributed energy resources; Photovoltaics (PV); PV grid integration; Self-consumption; Self-sufficiency","Economics; Energy resources; Housing; Investments; Distributed Energy Resources; Grid integration; Photovoltaics; Self- consumption; Self-sufficiency; Battery storage; business; electricity; energy resource; energy storage; energy use; investment; investment incentive; model; optimization; photovoltaic system; self sufficiency; smart grid; Germany","von Appen, J.; Fraunhofer Institute for Energy Economics and Energy Systems Technology IEE, Königstor 59, Germany; email: jan.vonappen@iee.fraunhofer.de",,"Elsevier Ltd",03062619,,APEND,,"English","Appl.

However, PV micro-generation is confronted with several challenges: (a) the average self-consumption does not exceed 25% in cold-climate regions; and (b) most of the generated energy during daytime is exported to the grid at a lower monetary rate per unit than that of imported energy. Governments and authorities envision the value of considering the integration of renewables at the community level since this strategy can leverage self-consumption and increase its social impacts and economics. This research aims to develop a systematic framework that simulates and optimises community shared solar. The performance scenarios of two sustainable communities are simulated and presented as case studies. In the first scenario, each unit is connected to a small PV system. In the second scenario, all units are connected to a large PV system. Evidence-based Monte Carlo simulation is applied to ensure the stochasticity of the diverse household users. It is concluded that the community shared solar application is preferred over individual rooftop applications as the former secures the uniform distribution of generated electricity among the community members. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Community shared solar; Energy-efficient community simulation; Load-match-driven design; Long-term monitoring; Monte Carlo simulation; Solar PV optimisation","Economics; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Housing; Intelligent systems; Monte Carlo methods; Solar power generation; Community shared solar; Energy efficient; Integration of renewables; Long term monitoring; Optimisations; Residential building; Sustainable communities; Systematic framework; Energy efficiency","Gül, M.; Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Alberta, 9211 116 Street, Canada; email: mustafa.gul@ualberta.ca",,"Elsevier Ltd",22106707,,,,"English","Sustainable Cities Soc.",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85052916231

The systems include PVT collectors with a polycarbonate flat-box structure design, a water storage tank, an auxiliary heater and a battery storage subsystem. A methodology is developed for modelling the energetic and economic performance of such PVT-based S-CHP systems, which is used to optimally size and operate systems for covering the energy demands of single-family reference households at three selected locations: Athens (Greece), London (UK) and Zaragoza (Spain). The results show that optimised systems are capable of covering ∼65% of the annual household electricity demands in Athens, London and Zaragoza when employing 14.0, 17.0 and 12.4 m2 collector array areas respectively, while also covering a significant fraction of the thermal energy demands in Athens (∼60%) and Zaragoza (∼45%); even in London, almost 30% of the reference household's thermal demand is covered by such a system. A corresponding economic analysis reveals that, despite the suitability of Athens’ weather conditions for implementing such solar-energy systems, the payback time (PBT) of the optimised S-CHP system in Athens is 15.6 years in contrast to the 11.6 years predicted for Zaragoza, due to the lower electricity prices in Greece. On the other hand, the high carbon emission factor of the electricity grid in Greece makes these systems particularly promising at this location. Specifically, the investigated systems have the potential to displace 3.87, 1.65 and 1.54 tons of CO2 per year in Athens, London and Zaragoza, when substituting the conventional means for household energy provision (i.e. grid electricity and gas-fired boilers). Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the optimised systems outperform benchmark equivalent systems comprising conventional sheet-and-tube PVT collectors in all studied cases, by covering similar or slightly (up to 3%) higher fractions of the household electrical and thermal demands with 9–11% lower PBTs, and that PV-only solutions displace 3.56, 1.21, 1.22 tCO2/year (up to ∼20–25% lower) for the same area. Overall, the results suggest that the newly proposed polymeric flat-box PVT collector designs are an improved economic proposition over their conventional equivalents, but that the cost of this technology still remains high relative to PV and that if decarbonisation is a desirable goal, especially in high population-density regions with space restrictions, it is important to consider how to promote this technology. © 2018 The Authors","Combined heat and power; Flat-box structure; Hybrid PVT collector; Solar energy; Technoeconomic modelling","Costs; Economic analysis; Gas fired boilers; Heating; Population statistics; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Thermography (temperature measurement); Box structures; Combined heat and power; Combined heat and power system; High population density; Modelling and optimisation; Photovoltaic thermals; PV-T collectors; Techno-economics; Electric power transmission networks","Markides, C.N.; Clean Energy Processes (CEP) Laboratory, Department of Chemical Engineering, Imperial College LondonUnited Kingdom; email: c.markides@imperial.ac.uk",,"Elsevier Ltd",01968904,,ECMAD,,"English","Energy Convers.

If the heat loss is minimized, to reduce the temperature losses, it is possible to cook with a low power source less than 500 W. A slogan has been adopted by the researchers-'It is temperature that cooks food not heat', meaning that it is not the flow of energy that cooks food, but rather, that food is cooked when held at a key temperature for a time. The slogan draws attention to the core concept that if heat loss is minimized, maintaining the temperature inside the cooker and the cooking pan, then the cooking process becomes very energy efficient. The paper considers ways to maintain temperature, but with due reference to the 'art of cooking', those all-important cultural processes that determine how meals are made. A prototype solar home system e-cooker was designed, fabricated and tested for cooking different foods in Bangladesh. Experimental results are presented to show that cooking is possible using much less power and energy than is commonly thought. A cost analysis is also presented to show that such a cooker can be cost effective in off-grid areas if connected to a properly designed Solar Home System. © 2018 by the authors.

The hybrid system is optimized to meet a remote stand-alone village community's load demand of 242.56 kWh/day with a 51.52 kW peak load demand. The result of this study indicates that the optimized hybrid system consists of 73 kW PV arrays, a 57 kW Diesel generator, a 387 kWh nominal capacity battery bank, and 28 kW inverters have the minimum Cost of Energy (COE) of 0.37$/kWh and the Net Present Cost (NPC) of $357,284. The outcome also indicates that the optimized system reduces CO2 emission by around 62% in comparison with the kerosene used in a current situation and 67% with the grid connected system. Furthermore, the Life Cycle Emissions-LCE (kg CO2-eq/yr) production is considerably lower in PV/Batt/ICE system than the other system configurations.

This goal is achieved by employing the KAPSARC Energy Model (KEM), which is the first publicly available large-scale energy policy model for Saudi Arabia. Past studies using KEM have examined industrial pricing policy, residential energy efficiency, the prospects of power generation technologies, and residential electricity pricing. These studies have shown that under certain fuel pricing scenarios, significant renewable energy capacity is deployed. With large-scale renewable technologies introduced in the power system, representing transmission more appropriately becomes important. By incorporating a direct current optimal flow model, our results show • the optimal investment in utility-scale photovoltaics are 30 percent lower, and the weighted average marginal costs of delivering electricity are 100 percent higher, compared to a model that has a transshipment formulation,• a version of KEM with a single node in each region for transmission and without transmission losses provides valuable insight while keeping the model size tractable,• the market-clearing price of natural gas in a deregulated environment modifies slightly, demonstrating that a transmission component predominantly affects the operations of the power system.

In this work, a three-step simulation based posteriori method is proposed to develop a scheme for eco-efficient operation of HEMS. The proposed method provides the trade-off between the net cost of energy (CEnet) and the time-based discomfort (TBD) due to shifting of home appliances (HAs). At step-1, primary trade-offs for CEnet, TBD and minimal emissions TEMiss are generated through a heuristic method. This method takes into account photovoltaic availability, the state of charge, the related rates for the storage system, mixed shifting of HAs, inclining block rates, the sharing-based parallel operation of power sources, and selling of the renewable energy to the utility. The search has been driven through multi-objective genetic algorithm and Pareto based optimization. A filtration mechanism (based on the trends exhibited by TEMiss in consideration of CEnet and TBD) is devised to harness the trade-offs with minimal emissions. At step-2, a constraint filter based on the average value of TEMiss is used to filter out the trade-offs with extremely high values of TEMiss. At step-3, another constraint filter (made up of an average surface fit for TEMiss) is applied to screen out the trade-offs with marginally high values of TEMiss. The surface fit is developed using polynomial models for regression based on the least sum of squared errors. The selected solutions are classified for critical trade-off analysis to enable the consumer choice for the best options. Furthermore, simulations validate our proposed method in terms of aforementioned objectives. © 2018 by the authors.

However, the high purchase price of these devices still limits their applications. This paper introduces an alternative form of distributed energy storage, cloud energy storage (CES), which is a shared pool of grid-scale energy storage resources that provides storage services to small consumers. The goal of this approach is to lower the cost of energy storage by exploiting the complementarity of consumers as well as economies of scale. This paper considers the investment and operating decisions of both the CES operator and the consumers to demonstrate the benefits of this form of storage. Numerical results based on load and electricity prices of residential consumers from Ireland show that CES can be profitable and that CES can benefit consumers by providing energy storage services at a lower cost. © 2010-2012 IEEE.","Battery; cloud energy storage; distributed energy storage; energy Internet; energy storage; residential consumer","Costs; Decision making; Economics; Energy storage; Housing; Investments; Battery; Decision making models; Distributed energy storages; Economies of scale; Electricity prices; Energy internet; Photovoltaic generation; Residential consumers; Electric energy storage","Kang, C.; Department of Electrical Engineering, Tsinghua UniversityChina; email: cqkang@tsinghua.edu.cn",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",19493053,,,,"English","IEEE Trans.

One of the parameters to compare costs of energy across various technologies is levelised cost of energy (LCOE), but it has been conventional practice to neglect the external costs in estimating the LCOE of power generation technologies. Furthermore, as LCOE is a critical indicator for policy and decision makers, there is a need to juxtapose actual costs of renewable and conventional power generation technologies. This research paper attempts to internalise some of these external and GHG emission costs across various power generation and storage technologies in all the G20 countries, as they account for 85% of global power consumption. As future investment decisions are largely influenced by costs, estimates in this research prove renewables and storage to be far cheaper than fossil and nuclear sources by 2030, even without considering external costs. The myth that renewables are ‘way too expensive’ has been debunked repeatedly, and the cost decline of wind and solar photovoltaic (PV) technologies have outpaced most industry expectations. The results of this research not only substantiate this trend, but also statistically display that all the G20 countries have the opportunity to decrease their energy costs significantly, between now and 2030. Renewable energy technologies offer the lowest LCOE ranges across G20 countries in 2030. Utility-scale solar PV generally shows the lowest values ranging from 16 to 117 €/MWhel and onshore wind LCOE range is from 16 to 90 €/MWhel. Rooftop solar PV generally offers the next lowest LCOE ranging from 31 to 126 €/MWhel, followed by LCOE of offshore wind power ranging from 64 to 135 €/MWhel. Solar PV and battery systems are highly competitive on an LCOE basis at utility-scale ranging from 21 to 165 €/MWhel and at residential scale from 40 to 204 €/MWhel. The G20, as well as other countries, can continue to develop their economies in a sustainable manner, along with substantial co-benefits in adjacent policy fields such as higher national welfare, better health of citizens, lower respective health costs and improved energy security. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","External costs; Group of Twenty (G20); Levelised cost of energy (LCOE); Renewable energy","Cost estimating; Decision making; Economics; Energy policy; Energy security; Fossil fuels; Greenhouse gases; Investments; Solar power generation; Wind power; Electricity generation cost; External costs; Group of Twenty (G20); Levelised cost of energies; Power generation technology; Renewable energies; Renewable energy technologies; Solar photovoltaic technology; Cost benefit analysis","Ram, M.; Lappeenranta University of Technology, Skinnarilankatu 34, Finland; email: Manish.Thulasi.Ram@lut.fi",,"Elsevier Ltd",09596526,,JCROE,,"English","J.

The conventional generation and continued use of fossil fuels as the main source of electricity will raise the operational environmental impact of electricity generation. Therefore, using different renewable energy sources might be a solution to this issue. In this study, a grid-connected solar PV-wind hybrid energy system has been designed considering an average community load demand of 15,000 kWh/day and a peak load of 2395 kW. HOMER software is used to assess the potential of renewable energy resources and perform the technical and economic analyses of the grid-connected hybrid system. The meteorological data was collected from the Renewable Resources Atlas developed by the King Abdullah City of Atomic and Renewable Energy (KACARE). Four different cities in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, namely, the cities of Riyadh, Hafar Albatin, Sharurah, and Yanbu were selected to do the analyses. The simulation results show that the proposed system is economically and environmentally feasible at Yanbu city. The system at this city has the lowest net present cost (NPC) and levelized the cost of energy (LCOE), highest total energy that can be sold to the grid, as well as the lowest CO2 emissions due to a highly renewable energy penetration. This grid-connected hybrid system with the proposed configuration is applicable for similar meteorological and environmental conditions in the region, and around the world. Reduction of some greenhouse gasses as well as the reduction of energy costs are main contributors of this research. © 2018 by the authors.","Grid-connected hybrid system; HOMER; Solar energy; Sustainability; Wind energy",,"Alharthi, Y.Z.; Department of Computer Science Electrical Engineering, University of Missouri-Kansas City, 5110 Rockhill Rd, United States; email: yza6x6@mail.umkc.edu",,"MDPI AG",20711050,,,,"English","Sustainability",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85054971246

The costs of generating electricity from grid-connected PV systems are studied with and without energy storage at the PV homeowners’ sites. Three selling scenarios for excess PV energy conversion are considered: net metering, wholesale pricing, and no payback. PV systems in Utah are utilized as case studies in this analysis. The presence of PV systems gives homeowners economic benefits such as reduced annual electricity bills. However, the levelized costs of electricity are considerably higher than the weighted electricity price in Utah. Currently, the addition of energy storage only benefits customers in Utah under the no payback policy. The impacts of PV systems toward electrical distribution networks are then studied on a distribution test system. Excess PV generation from residential PV systems causes voltage rise in the electrical distribution network. The results from this paper can educate consumers about the lifetime benefit of integrating solar energy into their homes. For grid operators, residential PV systems with energy storage can reduce the negative impacts on the grid compared with high PV penetration alone. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Distribution network; Energy storage; LCOE; Net metering; Rooftop PV","Costs; Economics; Electric energy storage; Electric power distribution; Electric power transmission networks; Energy conversion; Energy storage; Housing; Photovoltaic cells; Solar energy; Electrical distribution networks; Grid connected PV system; Integrated energy storages; LCOE; Net metering; Rooftop photovoltaic systems; Rooftop PV; Thermoeconomic analysis; Electric network parameters; alternative energy; economic analysis; electricity generation; energy policy; energy storage; photovoltaic system; roof; solar power; United States; Utah","Smith, A.D.; Site-Specific Energy Systems LaboratoryUnited States; email: amanda.d.smith@utah.edu",,"Elsevier Ltd",22131388,,,,"English","Sustainable Energy Technol.

Apart from the PV subsystem, an electrolyzer-hydrogen storage-fuel cell subsystem is integrated to the system to fully fulfill a varying load profile throughout the year. The fuel cell and electrolyzer components are based on proton exchange membrane technology. The model allows quantification of energy and power flows, such as power input from the PV subsystem, conversion of electricity to hydrogen, and re-production of electricity. The system components are sized to satisfy demand, which is varied through a case study conducted to investigate system performance at different capacities. The economic performance of the proposed system is assessed with a detailed cost model. The proposed system (base case) results in a unit cost of electricity at 0.216 EUR/kWh for a system capacity of 100 households, which is moderately higher than the current cost of electricity in Cyprus. A parametric study including those economic parameters with a high degree of uncertainty is conducted to investigate the sensitivity and future potential of the system.

Two occupancy scenarios (seasonal and regular) of the households were investigated under two storage options (hydrogen and battery) and each storage option consisted of six hybrid system configurations (three 100% renewable + three minimum 95% renewable). As a result, the levelized cost of electricity (COE) of off-grid renewable energy systems are found to be above the cost of grid electricity, however, a lot less when compared to previous years.

In this paper, we use mixed-integer quadratically constrained programming (MIQCP) formulations to determine optimal BESS takeover for violation control at various PV and ASHP ownership fractions, whilst implementing Monte-Carlo methods to explore the multiple possible technology ownership patterns that may occur at each penetration level. We compare the cost of feasible BESS takeover solutions to the cost of the reconductoring works that would be required to mitigate the same violations, where novel mixed integer linear programming (MILP) formulations are used to determine the optimum reconductoring strategies.

This study aims at performing a techno-economic analysis and optimization of a pumped-hydro energy storage based 100%-renewable off-grid hybrid energy system for the electrification of Djoundé, which is a small village in northern Cameroon. Hybrid Optimization of Multiple Energy Resources (HOMER) software was used as an analysis tool, and the resulting optimal system architecture included an 81.8 kW PV array and a 15 kW biogas generator, with a cost of energy (COE) and total net present cost (NPC) of € 0.256/kWh and €370,426, respectively. The system showed promise given the upcoming decrease in installation cost of photovoltaic systems. It will be viable in parts of SSA region but, significant investment subsidies will be needed elsewhere. The originality of this study can be emphasized in three points: (1) the modelling with the recently introduced pumped-hydro component of HOMER; (2) broadening sensitivity analysis applications to address practical issues related to hybrid renewable energy systems (HRES); and, (3) consideration of the agricultural sector and seasonal variation in the assessment of the electricity demand in an area of SSA. © 2018 by the authors.","Cameroon; HOMER software; Hybrid renewable energy system; Off-grid; Optimization; Pumped-hydro energy storage; Rural electrification; Sub-Saharan Africa","Cost benefit analysis; Economic analysis; Electric energy storage; Electric utilities; Hybrid systems; Investments; Optimization; Photovoltaic cells; Renewable energy resources; Sensitivity analysis; Cameroon; Homer softwares; Hybrid renewable energy systems; Off-grids; Pumped-hydro energy storages; Rural electrification; Sub-saharan africa; Rural areas","Yimen, N.; National Advanced School of Engineering, University of Yaoundé I, POB: 8390, Cameroon; email: nazerois@yahoo.fr",,"MDPI AG",19961073,,,,"English","Energies",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85056122393

However, the economic viability of such systems is dependent on effective use of excess electricity generation, most often through net or bi-directional metering. With recent cost reductions in residential-scale lithium ion battery storage systems, these may be a practical alternative. In this work, we model the lifetime performance and economics of residential photovoltaics with lithium ion batteries across all 50 states in the U.S. We investigate in detail how photovoltaic size and battery capacity affect performance and cost metrics in California, Georgia, and Massachusetts. We find that with appropriate sizing, photovoltaic-battery systems can be more affordable than photovoltaics alone. We demonstrate that these systems may be competitive with grid prices when the federal investment tax credit and favorable financing terms are used, and we calculate the sell-back price required for bi-directional metering to reach cost parity with photovoltaic-battery systems in every state. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","LCOE; Lithium ion battery; PV","Cost reduction; Economic analysis; Housing; Ions; Lithium-ion batteries; Photovoltaic cells; Taxation; Battery capacity; Battery systems; Economic viability; Electricity generation; Federal investments; LCOE; Lifetime performance; Residential photovoltaic; Battery storage","Tervo, E.; George W.

The hybrid energy system comprises a photovoltaic module and wind turbine as the main source of energy, and battery storage systems or hydrogen storage systems are used as an energy storage system, while a diesel generator is used as a backup energy source. A new multi-objective hybrid Particle Swarm Optimization – Grey Wolf Optimizer (PSO–GWO) optimization method is used to obtain the optimal size of the different system components to minimize both the total cost of fresh water production and, at the same time, CO2 emissions, for a period of 20 years. Moreover, a comparison is done between the PSO–GWO optimization method and the use of PSO alone and the use of GWO alone. The solar radiation, temperature and wind speed of the residential community are measured using the weather station system. A comparison between different hybrid system configurations using three different optimization methods is presented. The complete model for energy management strategies and the optimization models for this study are programmed using MATLAB software. The results show that the proposed PSO–GWO hybrid performs better at determining the optimization parameters than either of the same optimization methods used in isolation. The optimization results indicate that a battery storage system is more economical than a hydrogen storage system. Further reduction in cost can be achieved by incorporating a diesel generator into the hybrid system. Finally, sensitivity analyses are performed to show how varying certain parameters affects total investment cost. Such analyses have shown that the variation in annual solar irradiance has a greater impact on the total investment cost than wind speed variation. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Desalination; Grid; GWO; Optimization; PSO; Renewable energy","Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Desalination; Electric batteries; Energy management; Housing; Hybrid systems; Hydrogen storage; Investments; MATLAB; Optimization; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Photovoltaic cells; Renewable energy resources; Sensitivity analysis; Solar radiation; Water; Wind; Wind turbines; Energy management strategies; Grid; Hybrid Particle Swarm Optimization; Hybrid renewable energies; Hydrogen storage system; Renewable energies; Residential communities; Reverse osmosis desalination; Battery storage","Hassan, H.; Energy Resources Eng.

As capital costs of photovoltaics continue to fall, its role towards making buildings more sustainable and environmentally-friendly will continue to grow. Capital costs of a photovoltaic system comprise the module and balance-of-system costs. The latter refers to everything-else needed to make the photovoltaic system functional including cables, mounts, labor, etc. While modules are priced internationally, the balance-of-system cost is country-specific. Price developments of modules, which have been thoroughly studied in literature, followed an 80% learning curve. Research on the balance-of-system learning curve however, has not been as extensive. In this paper, we estimate for the first time the learning curve of balance-of-system costs in photovoltaics for more than 20 countries via an extensive dataset. Our calculations yield a global learning curve for the balance-of-system of 89%, which corresponds to a progress ratio of 11% compared with 20% for modules. Understanding the rate at which capital costs of photovoltaics are falling with such detail will aid in more effective renewable energy policy planning and budgeting. Finally, some steps requiring no financial commitment but can bring down balance-of-system costs are discussed, which greatly contribute to a cleaner and more sustainable future. © 2018 The Authors","Balance of systems; Capital costs; Learning curves; Renewable energy policy; Rooftop solar; Solar photovoltaics","Budget control; Costs; Energy policy; Office buildings; Photovoltaic cells; Renewable energy resources; Solar concentrators; Solar power generation; Balance of systems; Capital costs; Learning curves; Renewable energy policy; Rooftop solar; Solar photovoltaics; Cost benefit analysis","Elshurafa, A.M.; King Abdullah Petroleum Studies and Research Center (KAPSARC), PO Box 88550, Saudi Arabia; email: amro.elshurafa@kapsarc.org",,"Elsevier Ltd",09596526,,JCROE,,"English","J.

In this paper, a techno-economical model for the energy supply of a district including both electrical and thermal demand as well as renewable energy generation is developed. Furthermore, a high penetration of fuel cell electric vehicles is assumed and the hydrogen has to be provided by the energy supply system as well. The single components of the energy system are optimal sized, with respect to the total cost of ownership of the system, while the systems operation strategy is defined by a fixed ranking list. A reference case is defined by actual or near future techno-economical assumptions of the components. In the resulting optimal system, the most important components are a large PV system, a SOFC for heat and power generation and a PEM electrolyzer for hydrogen production. The produced hydrogen is used solely to refuel the fuel cell electric vehicles. On this basis, the influences of the components investment costs and the energy purchasing costs on the system configuration are investigated. It is shown that, the PV investment costs as well as the feed-in tariff can cause qualitative differences in the system configuration. Moreover, interactions between all conversion devices with respect to the optimal sizing are identified. Finally, it is shown that if the PV investment costs and the feed-in tariff decreases in the future, a reconversion of the self produced hydrogen in the SOFC becomes economically feasible, even for small natural gas purchasing costs. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","District energy supply; Genetic algorithm; Hydrogen; Multi-energy; Optimal sizing; Sector coupling","Costs; Genetic algorithms; Hydrogen; Hydrogen production; Optimal systems; Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC); Renewable energy resources; Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC); Vehicles; Energy supplies; Fuel cell electric vehicle; Multi energy; Optimal sizing; Qualitative differences; Renewable energy generation; Total cost of ownership; Use of renewable energies; Investments; combined heat and power; cost analysis; demand analysis; design method; economic conditions; electric vehicle; electrical power; electricity supply; energy resource; equipment; fuel cell; genetic algorithm; hydrogen; investment; photovoltaic system; power generation; renewable resource; thermal power","Bensmann, A.; Institute of Electric Power Systems, Leibniz Universität Hannover, Welfengarten 1, Germany; email: astrid.bensmann@ifes.uni-hannover.de",,"Elsevier Ltd",03062619,,APEND,,"English","Appl.

P2P energy sharing is being becoming more attractive than the conventional peer-to-grid (P2G) trading. However, intensive sensing and communication infrastructures are required either for information flows in a local market or for building a central control system. Moreover, the existing pricing mechanisms for P2P energy sharing could not ensure all the P2P participants gain economic benefits. This work proposed a two-stage aggregated control to realize P2P energy sharing in community Microgrids, where only the measurement at the point of common coupling (PCC) and one-way communication are required. This method allows individual prosumers to control their DERs via a third party entity, so called energy sharing coordinator (ESC). In the first stage, a constrained non-linear programming (CNLP) optimization with a rolling horizon was used to minimize the energy costs of the community. In the second stage, a rule based control was carried out updating the control set-points according to the real-time measurement. The benefits of P2P energy sharing were assessed from the community's as well as individual customers’ perspective. The proposed method was applied to residential community Microgrids with photovoltaic (PV) battery systems. It was revealed that P2P energy sharing is able to reduce the energy cost of the community by 30% compared to the conventional P2G energy trading. The modified supply demand ratio based pricing mechanism ensures every individual customer be better off, and can be used as a benchmark for any P2P energy sharing model. For consumers, the electricity bill is reduced by ∼12.4%, and for prosumers, the annual income is increased by ∼£57 per premises. © 2018 The Authors","Community energy system; Constrained non-linear programming (CNLP); Peer-to-peer energy sharing; PV battery system; Self-consumption; Two-stage aggregated control","Constrained optimization; Costs; Electric batteries; Electric fault currents; Energy resources; Nonlinear programming; Battery systems; Community energy; Energy sharings; Self- consumption; Two-stage; Peer to peer networks; control system; demand analysis; economic analysis; energy efficiency; energy market; energy resource; energy use; fuel cell; linear programing; photovoltaic system; smart grid","Wu, J.; Cardiff UniversityUnited Kingdom; email: wuj5@cardiff.ac.uk",,"Elsevier Ltd",03062619,,APEND,,"English","Appl.

The analysis primarily focuses on developing sustainable alternative to excessive reliance on Diesel Gensets in fulfilling the increasing seasonal shortfall in electricity supply from standalone Micro hydros. First, a preliminary assessment is conducted using hypothetical future shortfall in electricity supply from a Micro hydro of 10%, 20% and 30%, compared to a baseline of 2% shortfall, which shows drastic increase in the environmental costs (combined human health and ecological) by as much as 400%, 900%, 1400% respectively from continued use of conventional Diesel Genset. In the next step, a ‘Micro hydro sustainability indicator’ is formulated as the ratio of environmental costs to net present costs of different hybrid options. This is estimated through a mixed assessment framework, which combines consumer engagement for understanding the current and the projected future diurnal and the seasonal electrical loads along with quantitative evaluation of the corresponding costs. Finally, a demonstration case study implements this framework at the Khun Pang micro hydropower project in Si Lanna National Park within Chiang Mai province, northern Thailand for two scenarios – Scenario 1 (circa 2016–17, annual shortfall of 4% i.e. 571 kW h); Scenario 2 (circa 2025, projected future annual shortfall of 12.5% i.e. 3904 kW h). For smaller unmet load of up to 4% in Scenario 1, Diesel Genset turns out to be the most preferred hybrid option, irrespective of whether the environmental costs were included alongside the net present costs or not. However, for an increased future load of 12.5% in Scenario 2, including the environmental costs makes the hybrid Micro hydro-PV-Diesel-Battery system cost-competitive to the Diesel only option. Considering a 25-year project lifespan, it becomes the most sustainable solution for retrofitting micro hydro facilities in ecologically sensitive locations in order to meet future shortfall in electricity supply, with improved renewable penetration of up to 97.5%. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Emission; HOMER; Hybrid; Micro hydro; Off-grid; Rural electrification","Commerce; Costs; Economic and social effects; Environmental management; Hydroelectric power; Neutron emission; Rural areas; HOMER; Hybrid; Micro hydros; Off-grids; Rural electrification; Sustainable development","Tiwary, A.; Faculty of Engineering and the Environment, Northumbria UniversityUnited Kingdom; email: abhishek.tiwary@northumbria.ac.uk",,"Elsevier Ltd",03062619,,APEND,,"English","Appl.

Renewable energy sources, particularly solar photovoltaic (PV), have to be deployed to ensure daily life activities. Associated with information and communication technologies, solar PV systems contribute in establishing a sustainable development for these communities. Controlling power supply is one of the sustainable solutions to be adopted. This paper focuses on developing a Smart PV Power Supply Control system (SPSC) for off-grid solar homes. The proposed SPSC is a Machine to Machine (M2M) communication-based system. It aims at controlling the power supply, through either WIFI or Short Message Service (SMS) network, depending on consumption quota exhaustion. The PV off-grid home system sizing is presented. The economic analysis including the billing process are described. Advantages and scenarios of the proposed system are detailed. The system architecture is investigated. Main function programs are explained via flowcharts. Three main application scenarios are validated on an off-grid real residential 60W load. Firstly, the power supply control test is made when internet access is available. Secondly, the test is performed only through SMS messages and lastly through delayed SMS messages. The proposed SPSC can be used in rural areas where internet penetration rates are low. It helps solar PV installer companies control the home power supply depending on bill payment and consumption quota. Thus, it provides an overall evaluation of the solar PV market in Africa and a particular evaluation of solar PV generation compared with other off-grid generation technologies. © 2018, International Journal of Renewable Energy Research.","African Rural Electrification; GPRS-GSM Communication Network; Machine-to-Machine Communication; Smart Power Supply Control System; Solar PV off- grid system",,"Khelifa, R.F.Tunisia; email: fadhel.rihab@gmail.com",,"International Journal of Renewable Energy Research",13090127,,,,"English","Int.

The main energy source for vehicles in Bangladesh are the country's natural gas and fuel. However, due to the rapid depletion of the gas reserve, soaring gas prices and global warming, alongside the environmental pollution caused by burning fuel, this raises concerns about these energy sources. Renewable energy offers a plausible solution to these problems. This paper's objective is to focus on the maximum usages of a solar photovoltaic (PV) system in electrical vehicles and to minimize the environmental impact in terms of CO2 emission. This system may be partially used to power up the electric vehicle with a charging facility and contribute excess power to the national grid. The modeling, with its optimal analysis of the green transportation system, is simulated using the Hybrid Optimization of Multiple Energy Renewables (HOMER) software. The energy produced by the PV system can provide up to 13,792 kWh/year. Approximately 21% of the total production can be used in the charging station for charging the electrical vehicles and the rest of the energy can contribute to the national grid.

This has led to the use of diesel generators as source of electricity by the dwellers in these rural areas. These sources of energy are expensive and pose threats to the environment. Renewable Energy Systems (RESs) as alternatives to such energy sources reduce greenhouse emissions as well as cost of energy production. In Northern Nigeria, very few feasibility studies have been carried out on the development of RESs as clean and cheaper energy systems in remote villages not connected to the national grid. This paper presents techno-economic analyses of five different power system models in a North-eastern Nigerian village in Nganzai Local Government Area. The available renewable energy resources in the area were studied and the technical, environmental and economic aspects of five energy sources viz. diesel system, PV with battery storage system, hybrid PV/diesel with and without battery storage systems and hybrid PV/wind with battery storage system were studied using HOMER. Results from this study revealed that Nganzai district has sufficient monthly global solar irradiance and wind speed potential for the deployment of RESs. In addition, PV/diesel with battery storage system was found to be the most cost effective power system for the village in focus, with various cost indices being cheaper to diesel system by as much as 38 % and emissions cut by 36 %. © 2019 by Academic Publishing House Researcher s.r.o.","HOMER; Nganzai; Nigeria; Off-grid; Renewable Energy Systems; Solar Energy; Wind Energy",,"Bashir, N.; Power Equipment and Electrical Machinery Development Institute, Okene-Auchi Expressway, P.M.B. 1029, Nigeria; email: nour@naseni.org",,"International Journal of Renewable Energy Research",13090127,,,,"English","Int.

This paper explores different ways of utilizing an established off-grid PV-diesel hybrid system when the national grid becomes available. This is a rather unique starting point within the otherwise well-explored area of rural electrification. With particular focus on the impact of blackouts in the national grid, we evaluate the economic viability of some alternatives: to continue to use the off-grid micro-grid, to connect the existing micro-grid with or without battery backup to the national grid, or to use the national grid only. Our simulation results in HOMER demonstrate that with a grid without blackouts, there are few benefits to maintain the existing system. Low grid-connection fees, low tariffs and low revenues from selling excess electricity to the grid contribute to this result despite the fact that the system does not carry any investment costs. With a grid with blackouts, it is beneficial to maintain the system. The extent of blackouts and the load on the system determine which system configuration is most feasible. The results make clear the importance of taking blackouts in the national grid into consideration when possible system configurations are being evaluated.

In Peru, the definition of regulatory mechanisms and technical-economic conditions of connection of distributed generation are under discussion and development. This paper evaluates the technical-economic impact of integration mechanism called net metering on the end-user and the electricity distribution company (DSO), by connecting photovoltaic (PV) systems to the distribution network of the Arequipa City. The evaluation from residential end-user, connected to the low-voltage grid and associated with tariff BT5B, it is in terms of the installed PV power in kWp and the greater expected economic benefit, in terms of optimum values for consumption range. The evaluation from DSO, is made based on purchase energy blocks to the wholesale market to distribute regulated users. In addition, has been used indicators such as the self-consumption rate, coverage rate and impact about billing. The results find that net metering provides a strong economic incentive for the installation of PV systems by the residential user of higher energy consumption, a payback time of 6 years, considering that in the region analysed there are high level of solar irradiation. Consequently, end-users with low energy consumption will have less incentive to become prosumers, due to the existence of subsidized rate. The DSO would experience a reduction in the sustainability of its business, due to the injection of energy to the distribution network with a higher price than spot market. © 2018, International Journal of Renewable Energy Research.","Distributed generation; Incentive mechanisms; Net metering; Photovoltaic system",,"Villacorta, A.R.; Faculty of Sytems, Electronics and Industrial Engineering, Universidad Técnica de AmbatoEcuador; email: a.rios@uta.edu.ec",,"International Journal of Renewable Energy Research",13090127,,,,"English","Int.

Moreover, a non-renewable grid-connected energy system is assessed as a reference system. It is found that the optimized DER system not only meets load supplying, but also effectively minimizes emissions and system lifetime costs. DER systems are of great advantages over reference systems in almost all optimal evaluations, especially in Beijing, Wuhan, Shanghai and Nanjing.

The energy produced by the PV system is intermittent and it depends on the weather conditions, presenting lower levels of production than other renewable resources (RESs). The economic feasibility of PV systems is linked typically to the share of self-consumption in a developed market and consequently, energy storage system (ESS) can be a solution to increase this share. This paper proposes an economic feasibility of residential lead-acid ESS combined with PV panels and the assumptions at which these systems become economically viable. The profitability analysis is conducted on the base of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) method and the index used is Net Present Value (NPV). The analysis evaluates several scenarios concerning a 3-kW plant located in a residential building in a PV developed market (Italy). It is determined by combinations of the following critical variables: levels of insolation, electricity purchase prices, electricity sales prices, investment costs of PV systems, specific tax deduction of PV systems, size of batteries, investment costs of ESS, lifetime of a battery, increases of self-consumption following the adoption of an ESS, and subsidies of ESS. Results show that the increase of the share of self-consumption is the main critical variable and consequently, the break-even point (BEP) analysis defines the case-studies in which the profitability is verified. © 2018 by the authors.","Economic analysis; Photovoltaic; Self-consumption; Sensitivity analysis; Storage","alternative energy; building; economic analysis; energy storage; environmental management; feasibility study; investment; photovoltaic system; profitability; residential energy; solar power; subsidy system; Italy","D'Adamo, I.; Department of Industrial and Information Engineering and Economics, University of L'Aquila, Via G.

Demand Response and its effective coordination with renewable are additional concerns for residential segments. This paper deals with two problems: the demonstration of cost-effectiveness of renewables in three different scenarios, and the application of the flexibility of demand, performing as energy storage systems, to efficiently manage the generation of renewable sources while improving benefits and avoiding penalties for the customer. A residential customer in Spain has been used as example. The work combines the use of a commercial simulator to obtain photovoltaic generation, the monitoring of customer to obtain demand patterns, and the development of a Physically-Based Model to evaluate the capability of demand to follow self-generation. As a main result, the integration of models (load/generation), neglected in practice in other approaches in the literature, allows customers to improve revenue up to 20% and reach a basic but important knowledge on how they can modify the demand, development of new skills and, in this way, learn how to deal with the characteristics and limitations of both Demand and Generation when a customer becomes a prosumer.

Standalone photovoltaic power systems normally integrate energy storage devices, mainly Lead-acid battery, to compensate the supply-demand mismatch due to the nature of solar energy. However, the short cycle life of Lead-acid battery increases the operating cost of photovoltaic power systems. Supercapacitor-battery hybrid energy storage system has been proposed by researchers to extend the cycle life of battery bank by mitigating the charge-discharge stress due to the fluctuating power exchange. The existing hybrid energy storage systems and their corresponding energy management strategies vary in terms of topology, complexity and control algorithm which are often application oriented. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the state of the art for HESS and discusses potential topologies that are suitable for improving the service life of Lead-acid battery in standalone photovoltaic power systems. Theoretical analysis and numerical simulation in Matlab Simulink for different hybrid energy storage system topologies in rural residential energy system applications have been carried out and their effectiveness in mitigating battery stress are investigated and compared. A battery health cost function is proposed in this paper to quantify the impact of many damaging factors on battery, thus the effectiveness of different hybrid energy storage systems in mitigating battery stress and the associated financial analysis can be quantitatively compared.

Thus, governments and researchers are encouraging the use of renewable energy sources such as solar and geothermal energy in residential areas. However, high equipment costs and low energy conversion efficiency have reduced their acceptability to residents. Thus, researchers must determine the eco-feedback equilibrium point that achieves both economic benefit and thermal comfort. The objective of this study is to design and build a nearly zero-energy building (NZEB) with an HVAC system and an onsite solar photovoltaic system. Because HVAC systems typically account for more than 40% of total energy consumption in residences, a 24 h monitoring system was installed in the considered residential setting to measure the temperature, wind velocity, and energy in-out value with/without the HVAC system for several days in summer and winter. The thermal comfort period was analyzed and confirmed, and the air conditioner was switched on during thermal discomfort periods in one summer and one winter month. Temperature, humidity, wind, and energy data was recorded to calculate the average monthly energy consumption that provides all-day thermal comfort. Finally, two analyses were conducted; first, the real measured temperature after construction was recorded for thermal comfort analysis; second, the cost of renewable energy facilities and power consumption was converted to cost efficient rates to assess the feasibility of renewable energy input for the residence. The results of the experiment showed that the house could achieve better thermal comfort in summer than in winter. Contrary to our assumptions, energy consumption was highest in September and October rather than in July and August. Moreover, with a payback period of approximately 11 year, the cost-effectiveness is high for a house in the city of Guilin. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Cost efficiency; Eco-feedback; Low energy residence; Thermal comfort","Air conditioning; Conversion efficiency; Cost benefit analysis; Cost effectiveness; Costs; Energy conversion; Energy utilization; Geothermal energy; Housing; Investments; Photovoltaic cells; Solar power generation; Thermal comfort; Zero energy buildings; Cost efficiency; Eco feedbacks; Low-energy; Measured temperatures; Solar photovoltaic system; Thermal comfort analysis; Total energy consumption; Use of renewable energies; Energy efficiency","Zhang, Y.; College of Mechanical and Control Engineering, Guilin University of TechnologyChina; email: 2002079@glut.edu.cn",,"Elsevier Ltd",03787788,,ENEBD,,"English","Energy Build.",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85047255193

To eliminate the need of iterations, a new line power flow calculation method based on the line sensitivity factors (LSFs) is developed. It could precisely compute out VCPI without executing AC power flow program. Combined with the economic optimization software HOMER to determine the sizes and quantities of PV-DGs, the optimal buses to connect PV-DGs are selected by minimizing the sum of VCPIs. The proposed location strategy is validated by multiple IEEE test systems. The numerical simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method is accurate on VCPI calculations and has the decreased computation time compared with the Newton-Raphson power flow method. Through the continuous power flow results, it is verified that the optimal DG configuration selected by the proposed strategy could maximize the overall voltage stability margin of the system. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Distributed generation; Optimal power flow; Sensitivity analysis; Sizing and location; Voltage stability","Distributed power generation; Electric load flow; Location; Numerical methods; Sensitivity analysis; Voltage control; Combination strategies; Continuous power flow; Distributed generation units; Economic optimization; Optimal power flows; Power flow calculations; Power system voltage stability; Voltage stability margins; System stability","Kou, W.; University of ConnecticutUnited States; email: kouweichris@gmail.com",,"Springer Verlag",18683967,,,,"English","Energy Syst.",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85050267876

For this purpose, we develop a mixed-integer linear optimization model of a PV battery storage system that minimizes the electricity cost from grid purchases and employ it to study two exemplary households. In contrast to most existing studies, we consider the following issues: Our calculations are based on households’ electricity demand and PV production profiles in high temporal five-minute resolution. We take regulatory and fiscal treatment of so-called “prosumers” explicitly into account. Furthermore, we derive cost functions characterized by size-dependent, non-constant specific PV investment cost as well as by separated cost factors for the sizing of the storage systems´ capacity and its power electronics. In this context, we also clarify the interaction between possible peak demand coverage, rates of self-sufficiency and profitability of different system configurations. Finally, our analysis compares different modelling approaches regarding assumptions about perfect foresight horizons. Results show that modelling assumptions for regulatory and fiscal treatment as well as for specific investment cost can have significant impact on the economic assessment, and therefore should receive more attention in future. Besides this, our calculations reveal that economic incentives for investments in residential PV storage systems can gain great momentum within the next few years. © 2018","Battery storage; Energy transformation; Prosumer; PV; Self-consumption; Selfsufficiency","Cost functions; Costs; Electric batteries; Housing; Integer programming; Investments; Linear programming; Profitability; Battery storage system; Economic assessments; Energy transformation; Mixed-integer linear optimizations; Prosumer; Self- consumption; Selfsufficiency; System configurations; Battery storage; electricity; investment; modeling; optimization; photovoltaic system; profitability; regulatory framework; solar power; Germany","Dietrich, A.; Chair for Management Science and Energy Economics, University of Duisburg-Essen, Universitätsstraße 12, Germany; email: andreas.dietrich@uni-due.de",,"Elsevier B.V.",01409883,,EECOD,,"English","Energy Econ.",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85049733104

However, battery systems aimed at increasing self-consumption are not constantly put to use. Additional battery storage capacity is available for a second application to improve the profitability of an energy storage system. One of these options is the provision of frequency restoration reserves (FRR) to the electricity balancing market. This provision can be either negative to compensate for excess power supply, or positive to compensate for excess demand on the power market. This study assesses the benefits for residential and commercial PV-battery systems by combining PV energy storage for higher self-consumption with provision of FRR. Six battery storage dispatch strategies were developed and assessed on the technical and economic performance of 48 residential and 42 commercial PV-battery systems. These systems were modelled over their economic lifetime with a time resolution of 5 min and with historical energy consumption measurements and market prices. FRR provision results in a small drop in the self-consumption rate of 0.5%. However annual revenues are significantly increased. Using battery storage systems only for self-consumption is not profitable with the assumptions used in this study. Provision of negative FRR substantially reduces the electricity bought with the consumption tariff and increases investment attractiveness substantially. Prioritizing the provision of FRR over self-consumption enhancement results in even higher revenues, but significantly reduces self-consumption. We recommend FRR provision to economically investment in residential battery storage systems. Commercial systems need prioritization of both positive and negative FRR provision over self-consumption for a cost-effective investment. In conclusion, combining enhancement of PV self-consumption with the provision of frequency restoration reserves leads to profitable investments. © 2018 The Author(s)","Combining applications; Commercial; Frequency restoration reserve; PV self-consumption; PV-battery systems; Residential","Commerce; Cost effectiveness; Electric batteries; Electric power systems; Energy utilization; Housing; Investments; Profitability; Restoration; Battery systems; Commercial; Frequency restorations; Residential; Self- consumption; Battery storage; economic conditions; electricity; energy market; energy storage; equipment; photovoltaic system; residential energy","Litjens, G.B.M.A.; Copernicus Institute of Sustainable Development, Utrecht University, PO Box 80.115, Netherlands; email: g.b.m.a.litjens@uu.nl",,"Elsevier Ltd",03062619,,APEND,,"English","Appl.

Under Feed-in Tariff (FiT) scheme, solar PV has gained popularity due to its high FiT rates. However, the FiT scheme for solar PV has expired in 2016 and been replaced by the Net Energy Metering (NEM) scheme. The objective of this research work is to technically and economically analyze the solar PV system for a residential house under NEM scheme. The methodology involves gathering solar energy resource information and daily residential load profile, sizing PV array together with grid-connected inverter and then lastly simulation of the design system by using PVsyst software. Based on the results obtained, the amount of energy generated is higher when the capacity of solar PV system is increased. While most of the energy generated is exported to the grid, only up to 25% of load demand is supplied by the solar PV system. From economic aspect, the residential house does not need to pay the electricity bill due to the self-consumed of energy generated and profit gained from excess energy exported to the grid. From the environmental aspect, 2,434 kWh energy generated from renewable resource annually and consumed by the residential load has replaced the fossil fuel based power from grid. This value is equivalent to almost 1.7 tons of CO2 avoidance to the environment. © 2018 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

This slow uptake is attributed to the lack of awareness of four major stakeholders, namely the house hold, utility, financier and the policy-maker. This paper presents a coherent framework that addresses the concerns of the stakeholders using four country-specific parameters i.e. the local solar irradiation, PV system costs, borrowing and discount rates, and electricity tariffs; to compute NPV, IRR, payback period and levelized cost of electricity (LCOE). Assuming net-metering, we model the economic payoffs on self-consumption and sale of PV electricity at varying net-metering rates, system sizes, load-to-generation profiles, borrowing and discount rates. Findings suggest economic competitiveness of PV electricity, with an IRR and payback averaging around 28% and 5 years respectively. Moreover, the LCOE is also found to be significantly lower than the retail rates. The findings inform the household and financier on the economic yield; utility on efficient tariff setting; and government on sustainable policy design. Finally, we argue that GTRPVGS bears huge potential for Pakistan, suffering from energy deficit, unsustainable cost, transmission losses and environmental hazards. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",,"Competition; Housing; Investments; Irradiation; Photovoltaic cells; Solar radiation; Coherent frameworks; Economic competitiveness; Electricity tariff; Environmental hazards; Levelized cost of electricities; PV generation systems; Residential photovoltaic; Sustainable policies; Costs; alternative energy; competitiveness; cost analysis; electricity generation; energy market; photovoltaic system; residential energy; Pakistan; Nucleopolyhedrovirus","Aqeeq, M.A.; Institute of Business Management, Korangi CreekPakistan; email: arsalan@iobm.edu.pk",,"Elsevier Ltd",03014215,,ENPYA,,"English","Energy Policy",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85047241632

However in developing countries, only limited research has been conducted on the viability of micro-generation PV as a main stream clean energy source for greening the electricity grid. This study provides an insight into how residential PV adoption operates in a small developing country. Using a zero-inflated negative binomial regression model (ZINBM), this study compares the influencing factors of PV adoption in the Colombo district of Sri Lanka, a lower-middle income country, against the well-established factors of PV adoption in developed countries. The results suggest that highly educated middle-aged persons and retirees in the Colombo district are more likely to adopt PV. In addition, early adopters reside in larger houses of average, or above average, housing quality. In the short term, policies focused on expanding the knowledge base on PV technology, as well as incentivising the initial costs of installation, could increase the adoption rate of PV systems in Sri Lanka. In the longer term, increasing opportunities for tertiary education could accelerate the diffusion of innovations, as well as narrow socioeconomic gaps by even distribution of benefits of technological innovations. © 2018","Housing Quality; Photovoltaics; Spatial diffusion; Sri Lanka","Developing countries; Houses; Knowledge based systems; Regression analysis; Diffusion of innovations; Housing quality; Negative binomial regression model; Photovoltaics; Residential photovoltaic; Spatial diffusions; Sri Lanka; Technological innovation; Diffusion; developing world; electricity generation; housing; photovoltaic system; residential energy; technology adoption; technology diffusion; Colombo [Western Province]; Sri Lanka; Western Province [Sri Lanka]","Jayaweera, N.; Department of Architecture, Faculty of Architecture, University of Moratuwa, Bandaranayake MawathaSri Lanka; email: njayaweera@uom.lk",,"Elsevier Ltd",03014215,,ENPYA,,"English","Energy Policy",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85046335182

However, it has been overlooked in previous models about the green technology diffusion. This work developed an innovation diffusion model based on a social network, which was integrated with an anecdotal information exchange process. The contributions were to model the households’ evaluation, which changes with social influence, and analyze the impact of such dynamics on the adoption of residential PV. A case study was conducted for villages in Beijing. Different scenarios about policies have been considered concerning both the economic benefits and the information diffusion on social network. The results show that: (1) Providing insurance against the damage of PV to adopters for free can improve the adoption rate from 24% up to 62% (full insurance), and the new adopter acquisition cost is only 36% of that of providing additional subsidy; (2) The enhancement of communications (e.g. Bulletin Board System (BBS) and Social Networking Services (SNS)) creates an obstacle to the residential PV adoption when the majority of households have insufficient knowledge about the PV system; and (3) Information campaigns and information screening are both effective and necessary in mitigating the negative effect from the enhancement of communications at the initial stage of the residential PV market. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Agent-based modelling; Enhancement of communications; Free insurance; Innovation diffusion; Residential PV adoption; Social network","Autonomous agents; Bulletin boards; Computational methods; Housing; Information dissemination; Social networking (online); Agent-based modelling; Bulletin board systems; Information screening; Innovation diffusion; Innovation diffusion models; Residential photovoltaic; Residential PV adoption; Social networking services; Economic and social effects; energy market; innovation; perception; photovoltaic system; policy making; residential energy; village; Beijing [China]; China","Zhang, Q.; Academy of Chinese Energy Strategy, China University of Petroleum-Beijing, Changping, China; email: zhangqi@cup.edu.cn",,"Elsevier Ltd",03062619,,APEND,,"English","Appl.

In P2P energy sharing, prosumers directly trade energy with each other to achieve a win-win outcome. From the perspectives of power systems, P2P energy sharing has the potential to facilitate local energy balance and self-sufficiency. A systematic index system was developed to evaluate the performance of various P2P energy sharing mechanisms based on a multiagent-based simulation framework. The simulation framework is composed of three types of agents and three corresponding models. Two techniques, i.e. step length control and learning process involvement, and a last-defence mechanism were proposed to facilitate the convergence of simulation and deal with the divergence. The evaluation indexes include three economic indexes, i.e. value tapping, participation willing and equality, and three technical indexes, i.e. energy balance, power flatness and self-sufficiency. They are normalised and further synthesized to reflect the overall performance. The proposed methods were applied to simulate and evaluate three existing P2P energy sharing mechanisms, i.e. the supply and demand ratio (SDR), mid-market rate (MMR) and bill sharing (BS), for residential customers in current and future scenarios of Great Britain. Simulation results showed that both of the step length control and learning process involvement techniques improve the performance of P2P energy sharing mechanisms with moderate ramping/learning rates. The results also showed that P2P energy sharing has the potential to bring both economic and technical benefits for Great Britain. In terms of the overall performance, the SDR mechanism outperforms all the other mechanisms, and the MMR mechanism has good performance when with moderate PV penetration levels. The BS mechanism performs at the similar level as the conventional paradigm. The conclusion on the mechanism performance is not sensitive to season factors, day types and retail price schemes. © 2018 The Authors","Distributed energy resource; Energy trading; Evaluation index; Multiagent simulation; Peer-to-peer energy sharing; Prosumer","Commerce; Energy balance; Energy resources; Learning systems; Multi agent systems; Process control; Distributed Energy Resources; Energy sharings; Energy trading; Evaluation index; Multi agent simulation; Prosumer; Peer to peer networks; demand-side management; detection method; economic conditions; energy balance; energy resource; index method; numerical model; performance assessment; photovoltaic system; residential energy; self sufficiency; simulation; technological development; trade; United Kingdom","Wu, J.; School of Engineering, Cardiff University, Queen's Buildings, The Parade, United Kingdom; email: WuJ5@cardiff.ac.uk",,"Elsevier Ltd",03062619,,APEND,,"English","Appl.

The model addresses optimal investment and operational decisions of a desalination-based water supply system driven by surplus photovoltaic output and grid electricity. The two-level mixed integer linear programming model considers demands, systems configuration, resources capacity and electricity tariffs and gives the solution such that the highest compatibility with available renewable energy is achieved. The model is then applied to Perth, Australia and solved for three operational scenarios. The results show, for a given year, hourly (flexible) basis scenario leads to $9 521 425 and $18 673 545 economic benefits over seasonal (semi-flexible) and yearly (fixed) basis scenarios, respectively. They also indicate 19.9% better economic performance in terms of annualised unit cost of water production over existing Southern seawater desalination plant in Perth. Additionally, it is shown that the seasonal change on the optimal solutions mainly corresponds to the share of each energy resource to meet water-related energy demand.

Two objective functions, namely, LCA and LCC, were evaluated for each design and a total of 20 alternatives were analyzed. Two wall schemes that have been adopted from two different recent studies toward mitigation of climate change require clarification in both life cycle objectives. Design/methodology/approach: For this strategic life cycle assessment, Simapro 8.3 tool has been chosen over a 50-year life span. LCC analysis was also used to determine not only the most energy-efficient strategy, but also the most economically feasible one. A present value (PV)-based economic analysis takes LCC into account. Findings: The results will appear in present value and LC carbon footprint saving, both individually and in combination with each other. Result of life cycle management shows that timber wall−wooden post and beam covered by steel stud (W5) and wood truss with concrete roof tiles (R1) released less carbon emission to atmosphere and have lower life cycle cost over their life span. W5R1 releases 35 per cent less CO2 emission than the second best choice and costs 25 per cent less.

We calculate annual self-consumption levels and find that they are 855 kWh/year per household on average, or 45% of PV generation. We conduct a simple regression analysis to estimate self-consumption and use the results to show that self-consumption for an average UK household with electricity demand of 4000 kWh/year and 2.9 kWp PV system would be 966 ± 38 kWh/year, equivalent to a 24% reduction in average annual electricity demand from the grid.

Daily and yearly performance evaluation of the system is analytically performed through Engineering Equation Solver (EES) software and compared with the performances of a nanofluid-cooled PVT system without thermal storage and an uncooled PV system together with an economic assessment of the proposed system. A comparison of systems with and without thermal storage shows that the introduction of a PCM-thermal battery has made it possible to meet some of the building's thermal load but at the cost of reduction in the system's electrical and thermal outputs.

The addition of thermal storage has made it possible to cover up to 27.3% of the residential thermal load along with 77% of the residential electrical load. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Phase change material; Photovoltaic/thermal; Silver/water nanofluid; Thermal and electrical efficiency; Thermal battery","Climate change; Economics; Electric batteries; Heat storage; Housing; Phase change materials; Photovoltaic effects; Primary batteries; Silver; Storage (materials); Thermal load; Virtual storage; Electrical efficiency; Electrical performance; Engineering equation solvers; Photovoltaic/thermal; Photovoltaic/thermal systems; Residential application; Silver/water nanofluid; Thermal batteries; Nanofluidics; demand analysis; efficiency measurement; electrical power; energy efficiency; energy storage; equipment; performance assessment; photovoltaic system; residential energy; software; thermal power; water demand; Dhahran; Eastern Province [Saudi Arabia]; Saudi Arabia","Sahin, A.Z.; Mechanical Engineering Department, King Fahd University of Petroleum & MineralsSaudi Arabia; email: azsahin@kfupm.edu.sa",,"Elsevier Ltd",09601481,,,,"English","Renew.

The analysis is focused on residential buildings since these buildings consume over 48% of the total electricity used in Bahrain. The optimization analysis has the benefit to assess both at the individual building and the national building stock levels, the potential of the application of currently proven measures and technologies to improve the energy efficiency of the building sector in Bahrain. A sequential search technique is utilized to optimize the design of residential buildings in Manama in order to minimize life cycle energy costs using a wide range of energy efficiency measures. In the analysis, design features of air-conditioned single-family homes are considered including orientation, window location and size, glazing type, wall and roof insulation levels, lighting fixtures, appliances, and efficiencies of heating and cooling systems. Based on the optimization results, the potential energy use savings obtained for the optimal designs as well as the size of the photovoltaic panels required for net-zero energy residential building designs are estimated for Bahrain. Then, the economic and environmental impacts of developing and enforcing a more stringent building energy efficiency code are evaluated for Bahrain. The analysis indicate that the development and enforcement of a more stringent building energy efficiency code improve the energy productivity of buildings as well as the country with reduction of over 320 GWh in annual electricity consumption and 87 MW in peak demand. The analysis extended to the existing residential building stock indicates that Bahrain has the potential to cost-effectively decrease its energy consumption in the building sector by 62% with a reduction of 55% in its electrical peak demand in the future compared to the business as usual scenario. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Bahrain; Energy-Efficient Measures; Life Cycle Cost; Net-Zero Energy; Optimization; PV System; Residential Buildings","Air conditioning; Architectural design; Building codes; Buildings; Cooling systems; Cost benefit analysis; Cost effectiveness; Costs; Energy utilization; Environmental impact; Housing; Life cycle; Optimization; Photovoltaic cells; Potential energy; Zero energy buildings; Bahrain; Energy efficient; Lifecycle costs; PV system; Residential building; Zero energies; Energy efficiency","Krarti, M.; Building Systems Program, University of ColoradoUnited States; email: krarti@colorado.edu",,"Elsevier Ltd",23527102,,,,"English","J.

This article addresses the economic benefits of net metering for residential customers. Energy demands for individual apartments and common areas are calculated using the daily energy-consumption behavior of occupants for typical days of each month of the year. Photovoltaic (PV) generation is estimated for a residential building in Italy. The proposed net-metering scheme is applied on the aggregate energy demand of a selected building.

Compared to the use of single-household systems, the sharing of mid-scale electricity storage systems in neighborhoods could reduce the Levelized Costs of Storage (LCOS). However, a model for the shared usage of storage by multiple households has yet to emerge. We investigated eight demonstration projects in Germany and Western Australia with capacities between 100 and 1100 kW h with respect to potential business models and barriers in a cross-case study based on document analyses and expert interviews. We found that models relying on the transmission of electricity from individual rooftop photovoltaics to a shared storage system through the public grid are facing significant regulatory barriers. Removing these policy barriers would enable a more efficient use of electricity storage systems.

One of the main directions is the extended application of the technologies at smaller sizes. Micro-multigeneration solutions aim at becoming competitive at the size of the residential users. The cost of the technologies, in particular the cost of the cogenerator, is a major limitation to the diffusion of micro-multigeneration, especially in countries (e.g., Italy) where residential customers have a limited usage of electricity to supply their facilities. This paper discusses the prospects for the application of micro-multigeneration in Italy. The modelling and analysis of a residential micro-multigeneration system are developed from the energy efficiency and economic assessment viewpoints. The analysis is carried out on a typical system composed of a natural gas internal combustion engine, a small-scale photovoltaic plant, a backup boiler, thermal energy storage and electrical energy storage. A specific analysis tool has been implemented to address the operational planning of this system during a time period of one year. The whole model has been constructed from real data of thermal and electrical demand in a housing complex in Italy. The annual running cost and the primary energy savings occurring to serve the multi-energy demand have been considered in the operational assessment. From an economical viewpoint, the model considers the price of natural gas related to the cogeneration system, the electricity prices and all the tax breaks allowed in Italy. In this way, different scenarios have been constructed and assessed. The results indicate the impact of providing incentives on the purchase cost of the technologies, leading to increase the diffusion of micro-multigeneration solutions for the residential sector in the next years. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","CHP; Economic analysis; EES; Incentives; Micro-multigeneration; Photovoltaic","Costs; Digital storage; Electric energy storage; Energy conservation; Energy efficiency; Heat storage; Housing; Internal combustion engines; Natural gas; Electrical energy storages; Incentives; Modelling and analysis; Multi generations; Operational assessment; Photovoltaic; Primary energy savings; Residential application; Economic analysis","Portoraro, A.; Dipartimento Energia “Galileo Ferraris”, Politecnico di Torino, C.so Duca degli Abruzzi, 24, Italy; email: armando.portoraro@polito.it",,"Elsevier Ltd",01968904,,ECMAD,,"English","Energy Convers.

This is because mobile cellular BSs are known to consume a high percentage of power within the mobile cellular network. Such energy consumption contributes to the emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs) through the use of conventional diesel generating set (gen-set). As a result, mobile cellular operators are faced with the dilemma of minimizing the power consumption, GHG emissions, and operation cost, while improving the quality of service (QoS) of the networks. In attempting to find a solution, this study presents the feasibility and simulation of a solar photovoltaic (PV)/battery hybrid power system (HPS), as a predominant source of power for a specific mobile cellular BS site situated in the Soshanguve area of the city of Pretoria, South Africa. It also presents the technical development and shows the environmental advantage and cost benefits of using a solar PV/battery HPS to power a BS site with a 24 h daily load of 241.10 kWh/d and peak load of 20.31 kW as compared to using the HPS with a solar PV/diesel gen-set/battery. The solar resource pattern for the city of Pretoria was collected from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and was modeled statistically. The statistical modeling done using solar radiation resource exposure characteristic patterns of Pretoria, South Africa revealed an average annual daily solar radiation of 5.4645 Wh/m2/d and a 0.605 clearness index. The simulation and the design were done using Hybrid Optimization Model for Electric Renewables (HOMER) and Matlab/Simulink software. The simulation finding showed that the HPS of the solar PV/battery combination has about a 59.62% saving in the net present cost (NPC) and levelized cost of energy (LCOE) and an 80.87% saving in operating cost as against conventional BSs powered with a gen-set/battery. © 2018 by the authors.

PV technology is mainly being installed in distribution networks next to the consumption centres but it is an intermittent source which does not offer demand matching capability therefore calling for the redesign of distribution networks. In this study, battery storage and PV curtailment are compared as solutions for a residential area in Zurich (Switzerland) with large PV penetration from a techno-economic perspective. The techno-economic analysis focuses on the implications of the location (and related size) of battery storage and the type of curtailment control (fixed versus dynamic) for relevant stakeholders such as consumers and the distribution network operator. PV energy time-shift, the avoidance of PV curtailment and the upgrade deferral of the distribution transformer are the energy services provided by battery systems. Residential batteries offer more value for PV management than grid-scale solutions despite higher levelized cost but PV curtailment is the most cost-effective solution since only up to 3.2% of total PV electricity generation in energy terms should be curtailed for avoiding the transformer upgrading.

Results show that the two main drivers for the convenience of such systems are the load profile and the PV power plant power sizing.

In the context of falling global PV prices, recent advancements in battery technology and rising charcoal/fuelwood prices in severely deforested regions, the door is opening for a potentially transformative alternative – solar electric cooking (PV-eCook). While initial investigations focused on solar home systems sized for cooking (cooking device, battery storage, charge controller and PV array), it has since been shown that battery-supported electric cooking (eCook) can also strengthen national, mini, micro and nano grids. This paper presents a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) based methodology, accounting for a wide variety of socio-cultural, political, technical and economic factors which are expected to affect the uptake and potential impact of eCook across a variety of African contexts. It shows the concept has considerable viability in many African countries, that there are significant sizeable markets (millions of potential users), and that within the next five years the anticipated costs of eCook are highly competitive against existing ‘commercialised polluting fuels’. © 2018","eCook; Photovoltaic; Solar; Sub Saharan Africa",,"Batchelor, S.; Gamos Ltd.United Kingdom; email: research@gamos.org",,"Elsevier Ltd",22146296,,,,"English","Energy Res.

As the household appliances contribute significantly to the energy consumption of the smart houses, it is possible to decrease electricity cost in buildings by scheduling the operation of domestic appliances. In this paper, we propose an optimization model for jointly minimizing electricity costs and CO2 emissions by considering consumer preferences in smart buildings that are equipped with distributed energy resources (DERs). Both controllable and uncontrollable tasks and DER operations are scheduled according to the real-time price of electricity and a peak demand charge to reduce the peak demand on the grid. We formulate the daily energy consumption scheduling problem in multiple smart homes from economic and environmental perspectives and exploit a mixed integer linear programming technique to solve it. We validated the proposed approach through extensive experimental analysis. The results of the experiment show that the proposed approach can decrease both CO2 emissions and the daily energy cost. © 2018 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

Consequently the need for grid expansion increases [1]. A politically promoted alternative to grid expansion is managing congestions by the preventive use of flexibility options, such as flexible generation, load management and storage systems [2]. However, preventive congestion management is not yet established in distribution grids. Thus, various measures are under discussion to stimulate the provision of flexibility options by its owners for concerns of congestion management. Assessing the suitability of solutions among these congestion management measures (CMMs) requires a realistic modeling of grid operation, energy system structures and the behavior of the owners of DER and flexibility options. The intended application of the presented simulation framework is consequently the assessment of the macro- and micro-economic effects of preventative CMMs in distribution grids. Supporting that goal, the design of an agent-based simulation framework, which incorporates detailed optimization models for simulating the behavior of grid users (owners of DER and flexibility options) and Distribution System Operators (DSO) is presented. Exemplarily it is applied on a realistic distribution grid use case. The simulation framework enables analyzing the consequences of the grid users’ interaction with the DSO following defined CMMs. Within the framework, the grid users are modeled as individually or market driven oriented users, who both aim at improving their micro-economic situation. The DSO's operational target is the minimization of congestion management costs under application of several CMMs. The exemplary application focuses on four congestion management concepts, such as flexible tariffs and a market-based flexibility provision. The chosen use case comprises a congested distribution grid with high PV penetration and grid users at the medium and low voltage level. In the use case, the alternatively necessary curtailment of renewable energy can be reduced from 15% to 35% depending on the considered CMM. The most promising CMM (a market-based flexibility provision) reduces the DSO's congestion management costs by 33%, without degrading the grid users’ economic situation. Future work will advance the analyses based on a comprehensive database of realistic distribution grid scenarios. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Flexibility options; Grid congestion management; Operational planning; Smart homes; Virtual power plants","Automation; Commerce; Energy resources; Intelligent buildings; Flexibility options; Grid congestions; Operational planning; Smart homes; Virtual power plants; Digital instruments","Kulms, T.; RWTH Aachen University, Institute for High Voltage Technology, Schinkelstrasse 2, Germany; email: kulms@ifht.rwth-aachen.de",,"Elsevier Ltd",2352152X,,,,"English","J.

Five system configurations were simulated: a gas boiler (with/without battery) and an electric boiler (without demand management and with genetic and heuristic optimization). A sensitivity analysis on photovoltaic capacity shows the optimum photovoltaic sizing to be in the range 1.0 to 2.5 kWp. The gas boiler scenario and the heuristic scenario present the best levelized cost of energy, respectively, for the lower and higher photovoltaic capacities. The use of a battery shows the highest levelized cost of energy and the heuristic scenario shows the highest solar fraction (56.9%).

Economic modelling showed that, the cost of production per kWh lost due to dust exhibited by these systems were A$ 0.26/kWh and A$ 0.15/kWh, respectively. Comparison of the cost of energy losses and maintenance revealed that, the Perth system would require manual cleaning in October while the system in NTT would require cleaning in August and October. Although the saving in production losses is not economically significant, this cleaning schedule was recommended, particularly for small systems in NTT since the extra output can have a significant effect on the quality of life in remote villages. The key finding was that higher dust de-rating factors and more cleaning activity may be more appropriate for PV systems deployed in tropical climate areas than that in temperate climate regions.

Moreover, the transportation sector produces Green House Gas (GHG) especially CO2 emissions. Due to the excess power needed to recharge these EVs, the national grid has to supply more than 500 MW daily. This paper proposes an Electric Vehicle Charging Station (EVCS) based on solar and biogas to reduce the burden on the national grid. The proposed EVCS integrates a combination of a solar PV module (10 kW), three biogas generators (10 kW), 25 lead acid batteries (each 100 Ah), a converter (10 kW) and charging assemblies. This paper analyzes the technical, economic and environmental feasibility of the proposed EVCS using the Hybrid Optimization of Multiple Energy Renewables (HOMER) Pro software. This configuration estimates a Cost of Energy (COE) of $0.1302/kWh, total net present cost (NPC) of $56,202 and operating cost of $2540. In addition, the proposed model reduces the CO2 emissions by 34.68% compared to a conventional grid-based charging station. The designed EVCS saves approximately $12–$18 per month to recharge an EV which increases the socio-economic standard of EV owner. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Cost of energy; Electric vehicle; GHG; MSW; NPC; Profitability index","Biogas; Carbon dioxide; Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Electric power transmission networks; Electric vehicles; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Lead acid batteries; Photovoltaic cells; Renewable energy resources; Vehicles; Cost of energies; Electric vehicle charging; Environmental feasibility; Feasibility assessment; Hybrid optimization; Hybrid renewable energies; Profitability index; Transportation sector; Charging (batteries)","Karmaker, A.K.; Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Dhaka University of Engineering & TechnologyBangladesh; email: ashish@duet.ac.bd",,"Elsevier Ltd",22106707,,,,"English","Sustainable Cities Soc.",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85042884568

Solar energy can help in providing a certain amount of power to buildings. Full dependence on solar energy to provide daily demands to power of a building is not considered due to high cost. Thus in this research, the economic aspects of using a photovoltaic system to provide the full power for Kuwait residential buildings is investigated. The technical information for the solar system is assumed to have a full economical study; the technical information include information about load, panel array sizing, battery size, selection of controller and the selection of inverter. The economic analysis includes the estimation of payback period, return on investment (ROI), net present value (NPV), and cost of electricity consumption based on Ministry of Electricity and Water (MEW) tariffs in Kuwait. Weather conditions will be included in the selection of photovoltaic system components. It was found that the monocrystalline panel is the most suitable for the solar system. The tariff values have strong effect on the feasibility to use the photovoltaic system as the only source of power. Higher values of tariffs gives smaller payback period for example payback period calculated to be 7 years for 0.015 KWD (Kuwait Dinars) per kWh of the cost of electricity. Positive net present values are achieved for using photovoltaic cells to supply full power needs for a typical apartment in Kuwait.

Interconnecting multiple MGs as a multi-microgrid (MMG) is an effective way to improve operational and economic performance. However, ensuring the optimal collaborative operation of a MMG is a challenging problem, especially under disturbances of intermittent renewable energy. In this paper, the economic and collaborative operation of MMGs is formulated as a unit commitment problem to describe the discrete characteristics of energy transaction combinations among MGs. A two-stage adaptive robust optimization based collaborative operation approach for a residential MMG is constructed to derive the scheduling scheme which minimizes the MMG operating cost under the worst realization of uncertain PV output. Transformed by its KKT optimality conditions, the reformulated model is efficiently solved by a column-and-constraint generation (C&CG) method. Case studies verify the effectiveness of the proposed model and evaluate the benefits of energy transactions in MMGs. The results show that the developed MMG operation approach is able to minimize the daily MMG operating cost while mitigating the disturbances of uncertainty in renewable energy sources. Compared to the non-interactive model, the proposed model can not only reduce the MMG operating cost but also mitigate the frequent energy interaction between the MMG and the grid. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Energy transaction; Multi-microgrid; Robust optimization; Uncertainty; Unit commitment","Costs; Operating costs; Optimization; Energy transaction; Micro grid; Robust optimization; Uncertainty; Unit-commitment; Renewable energy resources; alternative energy; cost analysis; energy efficiency; optimization; performance assessment; photovoltaic system; smart grid; uncertainty analysis","Li, Q.; School of Control Science and Engineering, Shandong UniversityChina; email: qqli@sdu.edu.cn",,"Elsevier Ltd",03062619,,APEND,,"English","Appl.

Longer prediction horizons lead to better storage placement strategies but also higher computational complexity that can quickly become computationally prohibitive. The MPC strategy proposed here in conjunction with a Benders decomposition technique effectively reduces the computational complexity to a manageable level. We use the CIGRE low voltage benchmark grid as a case study for solving an optimal placement and sizing problem for different control strategies with different MPC prediction horizons. The objective of the MPC strategy is to maximize the photovoltaic utilization and minimize battery degradation in a local residential area, while satisfying all grid constraints. For this case study, we show that the economic value of battery storage is higher when using MPC-based storage control strategies than when using heuristic storage control strategies, because MPC strategies explicitly exploit the value of forecast information. The economic merit of this approach can be further increased by explicitly incorporating a battery degradation model in the MPC strategy. © 1969-2012 IEEE.","Energy storage; power systems; predictive control","Computational complexity; Degradation; Electric batteries; Energy storage; Forecasting; Gas generators; Model predictive control; Optimization; Planning; Predictive control systems; Solar cells; Standby power systems; Stochastic programming; Voltage control; Voltage measurement; Battery degradation; Benders decomposition; Forecast information; Optimal placement and sizings; Prediction horizon; Predictive control; Receding horizon control; Satellite broadcasting; Electric machine control","Fortenbacher, P.; Power Systems Laboratory, ETH ZurichSwitzerland; email: fortenbacher@eeh.ee.ethz.ch",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",08858950,,ITPSE,,"English","IEEE Trans Power Syst",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85028732313

In this context, cities in Latin America have high potential to convert sunlight into energy. Hence, the main objective of this study was to determine the potential of electricity self-sufficiency production and mitigation of GHG emissions in three medium-sized cities in Peru through the revalorization of underutilized rooftop areas in urban environments. Each city represented a distinct natural area of Peru: Pacific coast, Andean region and Amazon basin. More specifically, photovoltaic solar systems were the technology selected for implementation in these rooftop areas. Data on incident solar energy, temperature and energy consumption were collected. Thereafter, ArcGis10.3 was used to quantify the total usable area in the cities. A series of correction factors, including tilt, orientation or roof profiles were applied to attain an accurate value of usable area. Finally, Life Cycle Assessment was the methodology chosen to calculate the reduction of environmental impacts as compared to the current context of using electricity from the regional grids. Results showed that the cities assessed have the potential to obtain their entire current electricity demand for residential, commercial and public lighting purposes, augmenting energy security and resilience to intermittent natural disasters, with the support of decentralized storage systems. This approach would also translate into substantial reductions in terms of GHG emissions. Annual reductions in GHG emissions ranged from 112 ton CO2eq in the city of Ayacucho to over 523 kton CO2eq in Pucallpa, showing that cities in the Amazon basin would be the ones that benefit the most in terms of climate change mitigation. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change mitigation; GHG emissions; Life Cycle Assessment; Resilience; Smart cities; Solar panel","Carbon; Digital storage; Disasters; Economics; Electric power generation; Energy security; Energy utilization; Environmental impact; Fossil fuels; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle; Photovoltaic cells; Smart city; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Urban growth; Urban planning; Climate change mitigation; GHG emission; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Resilience; Solar panels; Climate change; carbon emission; climate change; electricity supply; energy use; greenhouse gas; life cycle analysis; photovoltaic system; smart city; solar power; Article; carbon footprint; controlled study; electricity; energy consumption; environmental impact; life cycle assessment; Peru; photovoltaic panel; priority journal; solar energy; temperature; urban area; Amazon Basin; Andes; Ayacucho; Latin America; Pacific Coast [South America]; Peru; Pucallpa; Ucayali","Vázquez-Rowe, I.; Peruvian LCA Network, Department of Engineering, Pontificia Universidad Católica del Perú, Avenida Universitaria 1801, San Miguel, Peru; email: ian.vazquez@pucp.pe",,"Elsevier B.V.",00489697,,STEVA,"29890610","English","Sci.

Therefore, clean, local, and sustainable sources of energy, such as solar energy, have recently been receiving more attention. In this paper, a complete design approach for grid-connected photovoltaic (PV) plants is developed. Jordan University of Science and Technology (JUST) is presented as a case study. The design is formulated as an optimization problem to find the optimal PV plant size needed to minimize the system cost and meet the design constraints. The uncertainties of solar radiation and temperature are considered using appropriate stochastic models. The optimization problem is solved using the Scenario Aggregation technique.

Incentives such as Feed-in Tariffs and Net Metering are seen as key policies to achieve this objective. While the Feed-in Tariff scheme has been widely applied in the past, it has now become less justified mainly due to the sharp decline of the PV system costs. Consequently, the Net Metering scheme is being adopted in several countries, such as Brazil, where it has is in force since 2012. In this context, this paper aims to estimate the minimum monthly residential demand for prosumers located in the different distribution concession areas in the interconnected Brazilian system that ensures the economic viability of the installation of PV systems. In addition, the potential penetration of PV-based distributed generation (DG) in residential buildings is also estimated. This study was conducted for the entire Brazilian interconnected system and it demonstrates that the integration of distributed PV systems is technical-economic feasible in several regions of the country reinforcing the role of the distributed solar energy in the diversification of Brazilian electricity matrix. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Brazil; Distributed generation; Economic analysis; Net metering; PV systems; PV systems penetration","Distributed power generation; Housing; Integration; Solar energy; Brazil; Different distributions; Economic sustainability; Net metering; PV system; Renewable energy source; Residential building; Technical-economic analysis; Economic analysis; alternative energy; economic analysis; energy policy; photovoltaic system; regulatory framework; solar power; Brazil","Vilaça Gomes, P.; Institute for Systems and Computer Engineering, Technology and Science – INESC TECPortugal; email: phillipe.gomes@fe.up.pt",,"Elsevier Ltd",03014215,,ENPYA,,"English","Energy Policy",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85044681626

The results are then compared to the solar PV AC system with similar load setup. The methodology involves gathering solar energy resource, configuring daily load demand, sizing PV array, battery bank and inverter and lastly simulation of the design system by using Homer software. Based on Homer simulation, the solar PV AC system required slightly larger PV array sizes than the solar PV DC system to compensate losses due to the inverter efficiency which is not counted in DC system.Moreover, the solar PV AC system is almost 8.0% more expensive with 6% higher COE than the solar PV DC system due to the present of inverter.Lastly, both systems will benefit from reduction of energy consumed up to 2,434 kWh annually and to the environmental aspect, will avoid 1.7 tons of CO2 releases into the atmosphere. © 2018 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

Combining PV and storage is one way that this challenge can be overcome. In this work, we use one year of smart meter data from 369 consumers in three different US regions and calculate their economic benefits from both PV and coupled PV-battery systems. We consider a range of different electricity pricing schemes from the consumer regions, including both Feed-In-Tariff (FIT) and Net-Energy-Metering (NEM) policies. Significantly, our work uses real demand data, real PV generation data and optimizes each individual consumer's battery operation to minimize their electricity bill. Furthermore, we study the effect of batteries on consumer self-sufficiency, which is important because increasing self-sufficiency is a primary motivating factor behind battery adoption. We find that PV is profitable for the majority of consumers with most current pricing scenarios but PV-battery systems are always less profitable. However, batteries can provide very significant increases in self-sufficiency and we find that a majority of consumers can exceed 70% self-sufficiency with a 20 kW h battery and a PV system that produces the equivalent of their consumption. This is compared to an average self-sufficiency of 35% with PV only. Finally, recognizing that a number of factors could lead to profitable batteries in future, we study the sensitivity of battery profitability to future electricity prices in a FIT scenario, also accounting for future decreases in PV and battery costs. We find that if PV-battery systems are to become better investments than PV-only for the majority of consumers, retail electricity prices above $0.40/kW h and FIT rates below $0.05/kW h are a likely requirement. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Battery economics; Energy storage; Prosumer self-sufficiency; Residential batteries; Rooftop PV","Costs; Digital storage; Economics; Electric energy storage; Energy storage; Housing; Investments; Photovoltaic cells; Profitability; Smart meters; Solar power generation; Battery operation; Electricity prices; Electricity pricing; Global sustainability; Number of factors; Prosumer; Rooftop PV; Solar photovoltaics; Electric batteries; demand analysis; economics; efficiency measurement; electricity; energy efficiency; energy storage; equipment; operations technology; photovoltaic system; profitability; self sufficiency; technology adoption; United States","González, M.C.; Department of City and Regional Planning, UC BerkeleyUnited States; email: martag@berkeley.edu",,"Elsevier Ltd",03062619,,APEND,,"English","Appl.

The limited numbers of SHS installed in HCMC are mostly on-grid systems with backup batteries to supply electricity to residential properties during evenings and/or power cuts. Semi-structured interviews with SHS installers, manufacturers and users, plus government agencies and technical experts identify pricing, regulatory issues and the cost of systems as major constraints. Cost-benefit analysis is then used to estimate the financial rates of return and payback periods for three representative SHS. Introducing net metering with a price equal to the proposed tariff of VND 3250/kWh would generate financial rates of return of over 7.5% and shorten the payback periods for the two larger systems from more than 30 years to 12 or 13 years. Smaller off-grid kits are already competitive with small, stand-alone diesel or gasoline generators.

The willingness of households to privately invest in energy infrastructure, and the maturing of battery technology, provides significant scope for more efficient energy networks. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the scope for promoting distributed generation and storage from within existing network spending. In this paper, a techno-economic analysis is conducted to evaluate the economic impacts on networks of private investment in energy infrastructure. A highly granular probabilistic model of households within a test area was developed and an economic evaluation of both household and network sectors performed. Results of this paper show that PV only installations carry the greatest private return and, at current battery prices, the economics of combined PV and battery systems is marginal. However, when network benefits arising from reducing residential evening peaks, improved reliability, and losses avoided are considered, this can more than compensate for private economic losses.

It is believed that the development of fuel cell vehicles will greatly facilitate reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector due to the fact that these vehicles are fuelled by hydrogen, which can be produced by a wide range of processes using renewable energy sources. In order to promote the use of fuel cell vehicles, it is imperative to build the necessary facilities to support this need in the near future, including hydrogen refuelling stations powered by renewable power generation systems. In this study, techno-economic analysis was performed for a hydrogen refuelling station powered by two types of hybrid renewable power generation systems (wind-photovoltaic-battery and wind-battery systems) which will be installed on the island of Gökçeada, Turkey. The analysis was carried out to assess the feasibility of the hydrogen refuelling station to refuel 25 vehicles on a daily basis throughout the year, using HOMER software. Based on the results, the levelized cost of hydrogen for the hydrogen refuelling station powered by the hybrid wind-photovoltaic-battery and wind-battery systems is $ 8.92/kg and $ 11.08/kg, respectively. The levelized cost of hydrogen was also determined for different variable parameters (wind speed, wind turbine hub height, solar irradiance, and project lifetime).

Microgrid efficiently and economically generates power for electricity consumers and operates in both islanded and grid-connected modes. In this study, we proposed optimization schemes for reducing electricity cost and minimizing peak to average ratio (PAR) with maximum user comfort (UC) in a smart home. We considered a grid-connected microgrid for electricity generation which consists of wind turbine and photovoltaic (PV) panel. First, the problem was mathematically formulated through multiple knapsack problem (MKP) then solved by existing heuristic techniques: grey Wolf optimization (GWO), binary particle swarmoptimization (BPSO), genetic algorithm (GA) and wind-driven optimization (WDO). Furthermore, we also proposed three hybrid schemes for electric cost and PAR reduction: (1) hybrid of GA andWDO namedWDGA; (2) hybrid of WDO and GWO namedWDGWO; and (3)WBPSO, which is the hybrid of BPSO andWDO. In addition, a battery bank system (BBS) was also integrated to make our proposed schemes more cost-efficient and reliable, and to ensure stable grid operation. Finally, simulations were performed to verify our proposed schemes. Results show that our proposed scheme efficiently minimizes the electricity cost and PAR.Moreover, our proposed techniques,WDGA,WDGWO andWBPSO, outperform the existing heuristic techniques. © 2018 by the authors.

The experiment was conducted as part of the Car as Power Plant project at The Green Village in the Netherlands. The main objective was to assess the end-user's potential of implementing FCEVs in vehicle-to-grid operation (FCEV2G) to act as a local energy source. FCEV2G field test performance with a Hyundai ix35 FCEV are presented. The car was adapted using a power output socket capable of delivering up to 10 kW direct current (DC) to the alternating current (AC) national grid when parked, via an off-board (grid-tie) inverter. A Tank-To-AC-Grid efficiency (analogous to Tank-To-Wheel efficiency when driving) of 44% (measured on a Higher Heating Value basis) was obtained when the car was operating in vehicle-to-grid (V2G) mode at the maximum power output. By collecting and analysing real data on the FCEV power production in V2G mode, and on BIPV production and household consumption, two different operating modes for the FCEV offering balanced services to a residential microgrid were identified, namely fixed power output and load following. Based on the data collected, one-year simulations of a microgrid consisting of 10 all-electric dwellings and 5 cars with the different FCEV2G modes of operation were performed. Simulation results were evaluated on the factors of autonomy, self-consumption of locally produced energy and net-energy consumption by implementing different energy indicators. The results show that utilizing an FCEV working in V2G mode can reduce the annual imported electricity from the grid by approximately 71% over one year, and aiding the buildings in the microgrid to achieve a net zero-energy building target. Furthermore, the simulation results show that utilizing the FCEV2G setup in both modes analysed, could be economically beneficial for the end-user if hydrogen prices at the pump fall below 8.24 €/kg. © 2018 The Authors","FCEV; Hydrogen; V2G; Zero-energy building","Buildings; Calorific value; Electric impedance measurement; Electric power generation; Energy utilization; Fuel cells; Heating; Housing; Hydrogen; Hydrogen fuels; Intelligent buildings; Photovoltaic cells; Solar power generation; Tanks (containers); Thermoelectric power; Vehicles; Building integrated photovoltaic; Demonstration project; FCEV; Net energy consumption; Net-zero energy buildings; Residential microgrid; Vehicle to Grid (V2G); Zero energy building (ZEB); Electric power transmission networks; building; efficiency measurement; electric vehicle; energy efficiency; experimental study; fuel cell; hydrogen; integrated approach; operations technology; photovoltaic system; power generation; simulation; technological change; Netherlands","Robledo, C.B.; Energy Technology Section, Department of Process and Energy, Delft University of Technology, Leeghwaterstraat 39, Netherlands; email: c.b.robledo@tudelft.nl",,"Elsevier Ltd",03062619,,APEND,,"English","Appl.

The idea to employ such energy source in urban contexts derives from the observation that, among the energy districts outputs, low-salinity treated wastewater can be used to produce electricity if a suitable source of high salinity feed (seawater of a salt-works) is also available. The methodology uses the HOMER software for assessing the district's electric energy production, consumption and exchange with the main grid. Then, starting from the total gross surface and the number of inhabitants of the district, some possible realistic scenarios characterized by different wastewater flow rate are defined. Finally, for each scenario the size and the yearly energy production of the salinity gradient power system are calculated thanks to a simulator carried out by the same authors. An application example, considering three different scenarios, shows that urban density plays a crucial role in the process and that the most promising realistic scenarios are those including treated wastewater and brine and unlimited seawater and brine. The economic feasibility of the salinity gradient power technology is evaluated by a comparison with classical renewable technologies such as photovoltaic and wind systems. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Distributed generation; HOMER; Salinity gradient power; Sustainable cities; Urban energy hub","Distributed power generation; Salinity measurement; Seawater; Wastewater treatment; Application examples; Economic feasibilities; HOMER; Renewable technology; Salinity gradient power; Sustainable cities; Treated wastewater; Urban energy; Electric power generation","Zizzo, G.; Università di PalermoItaly; email: gaetano.zizzo@unipa.it",,"Elsevier Ltd",22106707,,,,"English","Sustainable Cities Soc.",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85039854093

It uses a worst-case users' load demand approach for the design and analysis of the proposed energy system, according to international technical standards. It presents detailed capacity, yield and losses, battery state of charge (SoC), reliability, users' load demand increase (Ldi), and life cycle economic analyses by using the Hybrid Optimisation for Electric Renewables (HOMER) simulation tool. The effect of 25% Ldi is also considered in the paper. The study can be used to develop a practical energy model to address the poor energy situation in those locations when they are implemented. Results indicate that PMs of 68, 76, and 61 kW can meet the users' demand of ~63 500 kWh/year with an availability of 99.2% for the locations, respectively. By including a 30-kVA diesel generator to the PMs' model, an availability of 100% was obtained, demonstrating that the issue of loss of energy supply for several days in the year due to users' Ldi and the cloudy days is being addressed. The results further show that although the hybrid energy systems have relatively higher initial capital, total life cycle and replacement costs, and the cost of energy, they achieve a higher reliability compared with the proposed PMs. The research can be useful for planning solar PV infrastructure for remote locations around the world.

Finding an efficient framework that combines reliable design and satisfies continuous operation at minimal cost at all conditions is essential for both customers and investors. In this regard, this paper details the adoption of a creative approach using HOMER software to come up with a flexible design of a hybrid system that includes conventional and renewable energy sources. This study involves a comprehensive survey in this field, detailed techno-economic assessments, analyses of operational performance, and the evaluation of environmental aspects pertaining to the aforementioned system. It investigates all conditions that influence the system for both off-grid and on-grid connections by examining it over a typical remote Malaysian village. A sensitivity analysis was also conducted at all stages to verify the optimum design among all changes of different sell-back, power purchase, fuel prices, load growth, and other variables. Also, this study was proceeded to determine and examine the technical, economical and environmental aspects of the system. The results showed that the optimum system for both off-grid and on-grid connections consists of 300 kWp of photovoltaic (PV) modules, two diesel generators rated at 100 kW and 50 kW, a 150 kW converter and 330 kWh battery banks.

Moreover, the results indicated the importance of considering all parameters prior to the implementation of any hybrid system in order to realize the proposed objectives.

Recent reductions in the costs of solar photovoltaic (PV) systems have made them economically competitive with conventional electrical systems. The relatively steady annual electrical generation output of the PV systems when compared with the seasonal performance of the conventional SWH has created opportunities for solar PV to capture a larger share of the local water heating market.

At the same time, the emergence of the prosumer has created new opportunities for co-creation of distributed flexibility. As of yet, there is surprisingly little empirical analysis in terms of whether individuals are actually ready to co-create flexibility, and if so, under which conditions these resources can be mobilized by grid operators or electricity supply companies. We address this gap in the energy economics literature with three studies analyzing in total 7′216 individual decisions in a series of choice experiments with 902 study participants in three main domains of residential energy prosumption: (1) solar PV plus storage, (2) electric mobility, (3) heat pumps. We develop a novel measure of the prosumers’ willingness to co-create flexibility, and solicit their preferences for power supply contracts with varying levels of flexibility to derive implied discomfort costs. Our results indicate that current and potential electric car and solar PV users exhibit a higher willingness to co-create flexibility than heat pump users. Reaping the potential in those two domains requires taking the prosumer perspective into account when designing policy instruments and creating adequate business models. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Battery storage; Business models; Consumer behavior; Smart grid; Solar photovoltaics; Vehicle-to-grid","Battery storage; Consumer behavior; Economics; Electric power systems; Heat pump systems; Photovoltaic effects; Solar power generation; Vehicle-to-grid; Business models; Choice experiments; Electricity supply; Empirical analysis; Policy instruments; Residential energy; Smart grid; Solar photovoltaics; Electric power transmission networks; business; energy policy; photovoltaic system; smart grid; solar power","Wüstenhagen, R.; University of St. Gallen, Institute for Economy and the Environment, Tigerbergstrasse 2, Switzerland; email: rolf.wuestenhagen@unisg.ch",,"Elsevier Ltd",03014215,,ENPYA,,"English","Energy Policy",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85044635867

After presenting typical models for MIES, a residential community MIES is developed by analyzing residential direct energy consumption within a general design procedure. Integrating with available current technologies and local resources, the systematic design considers a prime mover, fed by natural gas, with wind power, photovoltaic generation, and two storage devices serving thermal energy and power to satisfy cooling, heating and electricity demands. Control strategies for MIES also are presented in this study. Multi-objective formulas are obtained by analyzing annual cost and dumped renewable energy to achieve optimal coordination of energy supply and demand. According to historical load data and the probability distribution of distributed generation output, clustering methods based on K-means and discretization methods are employed to obtain typical scenarios representative of uncertainties. The modified non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm is applied to find the Pareto frontier of the constructed multi-objective formulas. In addition, aiming to explore the Pareto frontier, the dumped energy cost ratio is defined to check the energy balance in different MIES designs and provide decision support for the investors. Finally, simulations and comparision show the appropriateness of the developed model and the applicability of the adopted optimization algorithm. © 2017, The Author(s).","Economic optimization; Micro integrated energy system (MIES); Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II); Uncertainties","Decision support systems; Digital storage; Discrete event simulation; Economics; Energy management; Energy utilization; Genetic algorithms; Housing; Natural gas deposits; Probability distributions; Sorting; Virtual storage; Wind power; Economic optimization; Integrated energy systems; Non dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA II); Non- dominated sorting genetic algorithms; Optimization algorithms; Photovoltaic generation; Residential communities; Uncertainties; Optimization","Bian, H.; NARI Group Corporation (State Grid Electric Power Research Institute)China; email: bianhaifeng@sgepri.sgcc.com.cn",,"Springer Heidelberg",21965625,,,,"English","J.

In this paper, an optimal planning approach is proposed based on 100% renewable energy system (RES) for a residential house. In respect to renewable resources potential in the site location and electrical demand, the best combination of resources is chosen based on minimum energy supply cost and maximum reliability. Furthermore, different scenarios are suggested by considering different levels of capacity shortage (CSH) and unmet electricity load (UEL) percentage. As a case study, the real electricity consumption data for a single family household is considered in Hesarak, Tehran, Iran. The final optimal solution for this 100% RES with the objective function of cost minimization and reliability constraint include 4 kW PV, 2 kW wind turbine, 4 kW converter and 6 battery strings.

This methodology facilitates the intricate decision process by which decision makers must go through to agree on robust long-term alternatives for the sustainable development of existing municipal energy systems taking economic/financial, technical, social and environmental criteria into account. This work presents a methodology to help local authorities with the development of an Energy Action Plan (EAP) towards more sustainable municipal energy systems and, simultaneously, ease the related decision process, by using MCDA. The developed methodology was applied to the municipality of Odemira, Portugal. After several interactions with stakeholders, a set of 16 actions was chosen. Once applied the ELECTRE III method, public lighting, the conversion of the swimming pool water heaters for biomass fueled, the matching of bus and train schedules and the installation of solar photovoltaic systems on the municipal exposition park were the best-ranked actions to be adopted. Also, up to 3 kton of carbon dioxide emissions can be avoided per year if the EAP is implemented, being observed higher benefits at the residential and services sectors. The decision of implementing these actions now stands with the municipality, which should start by implementing the most preferred actions first, and then proceed with the implementation of the subsequent actions, according to financial and human resources availability. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","ELECTRE III outranking method; Multi-criteria decision analysis; Municipal energy planning; Sustainable development of energy systems","Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Decision making; Energy conservation; Global warming; Photovoltaic cells; Planning; Solar power generation; Carbon dioxide emissions; Energy planning; Energy systems; Multi-criteria decision analysis; Outranking methods; Social and environmental; Solar photovoltaic system; Sustainable energy systems; Sustainable development","Neves, D.; IN+, Instituto Superior Técnico, Av.

Erratic power supply and rising operation costs (OPEX) in Nigeria have increased the need to harness local renewable energy sources. Thus, identifying the right generator schedule with the renewable system to reduce OPEX is a priority for operators and vendors. This study evaluates the energy costs of hybrid systems with different generator schedules in powering base transceiver stations in Nigeria using the Hybrid Optimization Model for Electric Renewable (HOMER). A load range of 4 kW to 8 kW was considered using: (i) an optimised generator schedule; (ii) forced-on generator schedule and (iii) the generator-only schedule. The results showed an optimal LCOE range between averages of USD 0.156/kWh to 0.172/kWh for the 8 kW load. The percent energy contribution by generator ranges from 52.80% to 60.90%, and by the solar PV system, 39.10% to 47.20%. Excess energy ranges from 0.03% to 14.98%. The optimised generator schedule has the highest solar PV penetration of 56.8%. The OPEX savings on fuel ranges from 41.68% to 47% for the different load schedules and carbon emission savings of 4222 kg to 31,428.36 kg. The simulation results shows that powering base stations using the optimised hybrid system schedule would be a better option for the telecom industry. © 2018 by the authors.","Diesel generator; Homer pro; Hybrid power system; Levelised cost of energy (LCOE)","Electric power systems; Hybrid systems; Renewable energy resources; Transceivers; Base transceiver station; Diesel generators; Energy contribution; Homer pros; Hybrid optimization; Hybrid power systems; Levelised cost of energies; Telecom industry; Cost benefit analysis","Jen, T.-C.; Department of Mechanical Engineering Science, Faculty of Engineering, Built Environment, University of Johannesburg, Auckland Park CampusSouth Africa; email: tjen@uj.ac.za",,"MDPI AG",19961073,,,,"English","Energies",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85049614655

Most of the people live in the rural areas of the country and having no access to grid electricity hindering the development of these areas and the overall progress of the country's economy severely. In this regard, renewable energy based hybrid mini-grid can be a viable solution to ensure access to electricity for all. This paper presents a case study of supplying electricity through hybrid mini-grid to the rural unelectrified areas of the northern region of Bangladesh, and provides an analysis of its business creation, operation and related challenges. The study involves modelling of three alternative configurations for electricity generation with the different combination of solar energy, biomass generator, diesel generator and battery storage resources. Hybrid Optimization Model for Electric Renewable (HOMER) software is used to carry out the techno-economic analysis and identify the optimal off-grid system configuration. The analysis exposed that the per unit cost of electricity from the optimum off-grid supply configuration is much higher than the regulated tariff for grid connected residential consumers and cannot reach grid parity even with the full capital subsidy. However, the cost of off-grid supply is economical than the diesel-only supply option or the cost of owning a solar home system. The analysis further considered different electricity selling tariff to obtain a practical and reasonable payback period to make the proposed hybrid mini-grid system economically worthwhile. From the emission analysis, it is found that the proposed hybrid system would produce 75% lower CO2 than the existing methods of fulfilling energy needs in the study area. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Bangladesh; Biomass; Electricity access; Hybrid mini-grid; Rural electrification; Solar photovoltaic","Biomass; Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Developing countries; Economic analysis; Electric utilities; Hybrid systems; Investments; Optimization; Renewable energy resources; Rural areas; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Bangladesh; Electricity access; Mini grids; Rural electrification; Solar photovoltaics; Electric power transmission networks; biomass power; chemical alteration; cost analysis; developing world; electricity generation; electricity supply; energy efficiency; energy resource; model; photovoltaic system; rural economy; rural electrification; smart grid; software; solar power; subsidy system; Bangladesh","Islam, M.S.; School of Electrical Engineering, Royal Institute of Technology (KTH)Sweden; email: msislam4@kth.se",,"Elsevier Ltd",03605442,,ENEYD,,"English","Energy",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85040089973

However, both the reshaping of the load consumption curve with the displacement of deferrable loads and the optimal management of the battery bank require estimation of the daily PV generation profile. The assessment of the on-site energy production can be carried out based on weather forecast data. However, the latter are characterized by uncertainty, which may affect the achievable self-consumption rate. This work investigates the influence of weather forecast errors on the performance of home PV systems equipped with a battery bank and characterized by a certain share of deferrable loads. Two different weather forecast services are considered, referring to the annual meteorological conditions occurring in Rome, and energy consumption data for 150 different households are analysed. The self-consumption rate is maximized by solving a suitable optimization problem, while different combinations of relative battery capacity, PV-to-load ratio and share of deferrable loads are considered. Two different approaches—deterministic and stochastic—are adopted and compared with an ideal approach where the PV generation profile is perfectly forecasted. The results show that the adoption of the deterministic approach leads to a reduction in the achievable self-consumption rate in the range of 0.5–4.5% compared to the ideal approach. The adoption of a stochastic approach further reduces the deviations from the ideal case, especially in the case of consumption profiles with a high share of deferrable loads. Finally, a preliminary economic analysis proves that the use of a battery bank is not yet a cost-effective solution and a price reduction of the current battery prices is therefore required. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Battery bank; Demand side management; Energy storage; Photovoltaic power forecast; Self-consumption; Solar photovoltaic","Cost effectiveness; Costs; Demand side management; Digital storage; Economic analysis; Electric batteries; Electric utilities; Energy storage; Energy utilization; Forecasting; Optimization; Photovoltaic cells; Solar power generation; Stochastic systems; Storage management; Battery banks; Cost-effective solutions; Energy consumption datum; Grid-connected photovoltaic; Photovoltaic power; Self-consumption; Solar photovoltaics; Weather forecast services; Weather forecasting; demand-side management; economic analysis; equipment component; fuel consumption; performance assessment; photovoltaic system; smart grid; solar power; stochasticity; weather forecasting; Italy; Lazio; Roma [Lazio]; Rome","Petrollese, M.; Department of Mechanical, Chemical and Materials Engineering, University of Cagliari, Via Marengo, 2, Italy; email: petrollese@unica.it",,"Elsevier Ltd",03062619,,APEND,,"English","Appl.

Using a data-driven approach, this paper simulates 15-min electricity consumption for households and groups them into local communities of neighbors using real locations and the road network in Cambridge, MA. We then simulate PV for these households and use this framework to study battery economics in a high PV adoption, high electricity cost scenario, in order to demonstrate significant storage adoption. We compare the results of storage adoption at the level of individual households to storage adoption on the community level using the aggregated community demands. Under the simulated conditions, we find that the optimum storage at the community level was 65% of that at the level of individual households and each kWh of community battery installed was 64–94% more effective at reducing exports from the community to the wider network.

If residential PV self-consumption systems become economically competitive in the near future, end-users will be willing to switch to PV self-consumption instead of using power from the network. However, if this transition were to occur massively or suddenly, the national energy system would be faced with a radical change. Our study has shown that French residential PV systems combined with Li-ion batteries could become profitable for individual investors before 2030. The demand in the residential sector would thus be natural in the near future in France. However, massive PV integration raises new issues for electricity system stakeholders (e.g. profit losses for traditional power generators, grid management, and sub-optimisation of the power system). This study has shown that PV self-consumption with batteries has a smaller impact on the power system than full grid injection. It is also shown that rapid integration is more costly than the progressive option with regard to PV system integration. We thus recommend a regular and progressive policy when transitioning to PV self-consumption to allow enough time for stakeholders to adapt to the new market situation. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Economic analysis; Energy policy; Photovoltaic (PV) self-consumption; PV residential systems with batteries; Stakeholder analysis; Systemic effects","Commerce; Economic analysis; Economics; Electric batteries; Electric power transmission networks; Energy policy; Housing; Investments; Lithium-ion batteries; Photovoltaic effects; Profitability; Economic assessments; Electricity system; Photovoltaic; Residential PV systems; Residential sectors; Residential systems; Stakeholder analysis; Systemic effects; Lithium compounds; economic analysis; energy policy; energy use; future prospect; photovoltaic system; power generation; profitability; stakeholder; France","Yu, H.J.J.; Institute for Techno-Economics of Energy Systems (I-tésé), Strategic Analyses Department (DAS), French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission (CEA Saclay), Paris-Saclay UniversityFrance; email: julie.yu@cea.fr",,"Elsevier Ltd",03014215,,ENPYA,,"English","Energy Policy",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85037341355

In order to reduce that effect in a cost-effective manner, the traditional distribution grid planning process is being reengineered by incorporating the grid control operations and considering the uncertainties e.g., DG power, demand and urban/rural expansion plans. One of the challenges is to determine if the required technology deployment to operate the grids can provide a better solution in terms of quality and cost than the traditional approach, which is principally based on cable reinforcement and change of transformers. In addition, if controllers were to be deployed, it would be important to determine where they should be placed and at what stage of the expansion planning, especially when the planning is assumed to be non-deterministic. Therefore, following this situation, in this paper we propose an optimal way to deploy and to operate utility's controllable resources at the distribution grid and additionally we consider the uncertainties related to PV growth and distribution grid expansion. Thus, we include the non-deterministic multistage perspective to the controller placement problem. Furthermore, we perform a techno-economic analysis of the results and we show that an optimal controller placement allows removing the overvoltage problems arising in the LV grid in a more cost-effective way compared to a typical traditional grid reinforcement approach. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Distribution grid planning; Model predictive control; Photovoltaics; Voltage control","Controllers; Cost benefit analysis; Cost effectiveness; Costs; Economic analysis; Electric power transmission networks; Expansion; Model predictive control; Reinforcement; Voltage control; Controller placements; Distribution grid planning; Low-voltage distributions; Photovoltaics; Residential photovoltaic; Techno-Economic analysis; Technology deployment; Traditional approaches; Electric power system control","Armendáriz, M.; KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Osquldas väg 10, 7 tr, Sweden; email: mikel@kth.se",,"Elsevier Ltd",03787796,,EPSRD,,"English","Electr Power Syst Res",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85030835113

Mainly economic and technological issues impede a relevant integration of conventional storage devices in the energy system. In this scenario, the hybridization of different storage technologies can be a techno-economic solution useful to overcome these issues and promote their diffusion. Hybridization allows multi-operation modes of the Energy Storage System (ESS), merging the positive features of base-technologies and extending their application ranges. This paper provides a dynamic analysis of a hybrid energy storage system (H-ESS) consisting of a flywheel and a battery pack coupled to a photovoltaic generation plant and a residential load up to 20 kW. A dynamic model of the overall micro-grid (MG) was developed implementing the H-ESS preliminary sizing and a suitable management algorithm. The instantaneous behavior of each component was evaluated.

Among sustainability projects, urban wind energy is emerging as a technology useful in diffusion of smart grids for energetic sustainable development and also an interesting growing niche market in which there could be new investment opportunities. Numerous projects aimed at developing wind energy production are under constructions and wind characteristics and power potential of various sites have been studied in many Mediterranean countries. The urban wind analysis may represent a new tool to complete local wind atlases including the built environment, to evaluate changes that weathering may cause in the physical and architectural state of buildings, and to analyze the dispersion of pollutants from sources to receptor sites. In this paper, an analysis of wind potential and characteristics in Taranto, Apulia, a north Jonian urban site in Italy, has been performed by using high time resolved (10 min) meteorological data collected over a time span of two years, in the aim to describe the numerical procedures adopted to perform fitting of wind speed data without using special software. This urban site, in the first year of investigation from May 1st, 2009 to April 30th, 2010, was subjected to main wind regimes that come mostly from N with 12.27% and SSW with 9.89% of total hours; the calm occurred with a frequency of 10.94%. In the second year, from May 1st, 2010 to April 30th, 2011, the winds also blown predominantly from N with 12.56% of the total annual hours, and SSW with 9.33%, while the calms reached 11.08%. Dispersion of pollutants emitted from various sources among cement factory, a quarry/landfill, a refinery and the steelworks, poses serious health risks to population mainly resident downwind the prevalent wind directions. Simply computed mean wind speeds had values of 1.84 (sd = 0.26 m/s) in the first year and 1.90 m/s (sd = 0.30 m/s) in the second year under investigation. Weibull's k values, measuring the wind potential of the site, were higher during the spring-summer warmest months and lower during the autumn-winter; the lowest appeared in November 2009 (0.639) the highest in June 2010 (1.665). Mean yearly values of k were 1.210 (sd = 0.18) in the first year and 1.065 (sd = 0.24) in the second year of the study, the correlation between the monthly values of k in the years under consideration was R2 = 0.59 (p = 0.043) indicating that although variations occurred, the wind potential remain partly unaltered from one year to the other examined. LCOE (Levelized Cost of Electricity) for the wind turbines chosen among the 35 ones listed in the “Catalogue of European Urban Wind Turbine Manufactures”, excluding those with rated power below 0.1 kW, ranged from 0.12 to 10.6 €/kWh and differs slightly in the two years examined. The values were competitive with some off-shore and on-shore installations, biogas and photovoltaic, but it does not consider pollution costs and subsidies. The proposed solution was economically viable, also by considering the possible integration in a hybrid photovoltaic-wind system, or fossil-based heat generator system supplemented by solar photovoltaic and wind energy. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Levelized cost of electricity; Sustainability; Taranto; Urban development; Urban wind turbine; Weibull distribution function","Costs; Distribution functions; Economics; Health risks; Investments; Meteorology; Pollution; Smart power grids; Solar power generation; Steel; Steel construction; Sustainable development; Weibull distribution; Wind; Wind power; Wind turbines; Investment opportunities; Levelized cost of electricities; Mediterranean countries; Sustainability project; Sustainable urban development; Taranto; Urban development; Wind energy production; Urban growth","Giungato, P.; Department of Chemistry, University of Bari “Aldo Moro”, Via Orabona, 4, Italy; email: pasquale.giungato@uniba.it",,"Elsevier Ltd",09596526,,JCROE,,"English","J.

Understanding and managing the risks associated with this complex, consumer-led transformation will be critical to minimize disruption and achieve effective integration. In this paper, we use a case study of Queensland Australia and causal loop modelling, underpinned by qualitative data sourced from extensive interviews with expert stakeholders, to consider how residential battery energy storage deployed at-scale could erode the dominance of the traditional centralized electricity supply model. With feedback loops highlighting the primacy of the consumer in coming years, our modelling suggests that a failure by incumbent utilities and policy makers to respond to consumer needs, or subvert access to battery technology, will ultimately reinforce consumer drivers for self-sufficiency and grid independence. Our analysis highlights that energy policy should address consumers’ non-financial motivations for grid independence while concurrently incentivizing the strategic management of home battery energy storage to achieve beneficial whole-of-system outcomes. The development of price-based signals that assign fair-value along the supply chain could help achieve both of these objectives. Our analysis highlights the importance of taking a long-term, systems-based view of residential battery deployment to avoid negative outcomes along the supply chain and to help achieve the most efficient integration. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Battery storage; Causal loop modelling; Energy policy; Residential; Solar; Systems thinking","Activated carbon; Adsorption; Cobalt; Copper; Cost effectiveness; Diesel fuels; Hydrodesulfurization; Nanocomposites; Nanoparticles; Nanotechnology; Petroleum refining; Sulfur; Sulfur compounds; Thiophene; 4 ,6-Dimethyl-dibenzothiophene; Adsorption capacities; Adsorption process; Adsorptive desulfurization; Bimetallic nanoparticles; Copper nanoparticles; Intra-particle diffusion; Pseudo second order kinetics; Desulfurization","Agnew, S.; School of Earth and Environmental Sciences, The University of QueenslandAustralia; email: s.agnew@uq.edu.au",,"Elsevier Ltd",09596526,,JCROE,,"English","J.

The ISO 14046 framework was followed to address the quantitative —freshwater scarcity— and qualitative —degradation— water-related impacts from a life cycle perspective. The timeline perspective allowed the analysis of the fluctuation of impacts for this kind of product. For the quantitative blue water-related impacts, the Available WAter REmaining (AWARE) method was implemented to assess the freshwater scarcity impacts, being the selection of characterization factors (CFs) essential to establish the main impact contributors, especially for direct water consumption at spatial scale. Blue water scarcity impact results varied considerably during the period assessed, mainly due to changes in the harvest yield. The impact results obtained from the AWARE method were compared with the results obtained with other water-related impact assessment methods —water stress index and water depletion. The results for both share the same trends as the AWARE method, with direct water consumption representing 30%–40% of the total contributions throughout the assessed period. The green water scarcity footprint was also evaluated, showing that there are perturbations in the production of surface blue water and green moisture recycled to the atmosphere. The sensitivity analysis on green water CFs showed high variations in green water scarcity footprint results, highlighting the relevance of deriving spatially differentiated and crop-specific green water CFs to assess real water consumption impacts on crop fields properly. On-field emissions were the primary responsible for water degradation impacts; in particular, those resulting from fuel consumption, pesticides application and fertilization. The sensitivity analysis conducted for pesticides emissions highlighted the necessity of a consensus dispersion model to address them. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","AWARE; Life Cycle Assessment; Spain; Temporal analysis; Viticulture; Water footprint","Digital storage; Electric energy storage; Energy policy; Energy storage; Housing; Photovoltaic cells; Supply chains; Battery energy storage; Battery storage; Financial motivation; Residential; Residential photovoltaic; Solar; Strategic management; Systems thinking; Electric batteries","Villanueva-Rey, P.; Department of Chemical Engineering, Institute of Technology, Universidade de Santiago de CompostelaSpain; email: pedro.villanueva@usc.es",,"Elsevier Ltd",09596526,,JCROE,,"English","J.

This paper combines dwelling/household archetypes (DHAs) combined with a mixed integer linear program to generate optimal (minimum cost) technology configurations and operation schedules for individual dwellings. These DHAs are scaled up to three socioeconomically differentiated neighbourhood clusters at the Output Area level in the UK. A synthetic distribution network generation and simulation assesses the required network upgrade costs for these clusters with different LCT penetration scenarios. Whilst the application here is to the United Kingdom (UK) setting, the method is largely based on freely available data and is therefore highly transferable to other contexts. The results show significant differences between the upgrade costs of the three analysed network types, and especially the semi-rural cluster has much higher costs. The employment of heat pumps together with photovoltaics (PV) has strong synergy effects, which can considerably reduce the network upgrade and carbon abatement costs if deployed in parallel. The determined CO2-abatement costs also suggest that decarbonisation measures with these two technologies should focus on semi-urban neighbourhoods due to the lower cost in comparison to the semi-rural case. This shows that such a socioeconomically differentiated approach to distribution network modelling can provide useful energy policy insights. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Households; Low carbon technologies; Low voltage distribution network; Neighbourhoods, socioeconomic factors; Network upgrade; Residential buildings","Buildings; Electric power distribution; Electric power systems; Heating; Housing; Integer programming; Photovoltaic effects; Voltage distribution measurement; Households; Low voltage distribution network; Low-carbon technologies; Network upgrades; Residential building; Socio-economic factor; Costs; building; distribution system; energy resource; heat source; household structure; neighborhood; residential energy; simulation; socioeconomic impact; United Kingdom","McKenna, R.; Institute for Industrial Production (IIP), Building 06.33, Hertzstr. 16, Germany; email: mckenna@kit.edu",,"Elsevier Ltd",03062619,,APEND,,"English","Appl.

An optimization method is proposed based on Latin hypercube sampling, scene reduction and self-learning difference algorithm to solve the proposed model. Firstly, a large number of samples are generated with Latin hypercube sampling method according to probability distribution of wind, solar light and load prediction, and the generated samples are reduced with scene reduction method. Secondly, a new method is proposed to solve the problem that ""convergence"" phenomenon possibly occurring in late stage of standard difference algorithm is prone to falling into local optimal situation.

Additionally, recent policy developments indicate a decreased tariff in the future for electricity sold to the grid by households with DERs. Energy Storage Systems (ESS) combined with Demand Side Management (DSM) can improve the self-consumption of Photovoltaic (PV) generated electricity and decrease grid imbalance between supply and demand. Household Energy Storage (HES) and Community Energy Storage (CES) are two promising storage scenarios for residential electricity prosumers. This paper aims to assess and compare the technical and economic feasibility of both HES and CES. To do that, mathematical optimization is used in both scenarios, where a Home Energy Management System (HEMS) schedules the allocation of energy from the PV system, battery and the grid in order to satisfy the power demand of households using a dynamic pricing scheme. The problem is formulated as a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) with the objective of minimizing the costs of power received from the grid. Data from real demand and PV generation profiles of 39 households in a pilot project initiated by the Distribution System Operator (DSO) ’Enexis’ in Breda, the Netherlands, is used for the numerical analysis. Results show that the self consumption of PV power is the largest contributor to the savings obtained when using ESS. The implementation of different ESS reduces annual costs by 22–30% and increases the self-consumption of PV power by 23–29%. Finally, a sensitivity analysis is performed which shows how investment costs of ESS per kWh are crucial in determining the economic feasibility of both systems. © 2017 The Authors","Demand side management; Energy management systems; Energy storage systems; Mixed integer linear programming; Photovoltaic; Self-consumption","Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Demand side management; Digital instruments; Digital storage; Economic analysis; Economics; Electric energy storage; Electric power transmission networks; Electric power utilization; Electric utilities; Energy management; Energy resources; Energy storage; Housing; Integer programming; Investments; Optimization; Photovoltaic cells; Sensitivity analysis; Storage management; Community energy storages (CES); Decentralized energy resources; Energy storage systems; Home energy management systems; Mathematical optimizations; Mixed integer linear programming; Photovoltaic; Self-consumption; Energy management systems; consumption behavior; demand-side management; distribution system; economic analysis; electricity; electronic equipment; energy planning; energy use; household energy; investment; linear programing; optimization; photovoltaic system; residential energy; sensitivity analysis; smart grid; Breda; Netherlands; North Brabant","AlSkaif, T.; Copernicus Institute of Sustainable Development, Utrecht University (UU)Netherlands; email: t.a.alskaif@uu.nl",,"Elsevier Ltd",03062619,,APEND,,"English","Appl.

We use the PVSyst® software to estimate the annual energy yield of rooftop solar PV in selected cities across the country. The paper also heads on to estimate the levelized unit cost of electricity and the break-even capital cost of rooftop solar PV. The available roof area for solar PV in urban residential buildings of Nigeria is estimated at 796 km2 and the technical potential at around 124 GWp. Annual energy yield and levelized unit cost of electricity analysis shows that Kano and Port Harcourt cities have the highest and lowest potentials of rooftop solar PV respectively.

Wind-based and photovoltaic- (PV-) based power generation are two of the most promising renewable energy technologies. Fuel cell (FC) systems also show great potential in DG applications due to their fast technological development and the merits they have, such as high efficiency, zero or low emissions (of pollutant gases), and flexible modular structure. In this work, the techno-economic feasibility study (using HOMER) of emission-free hybrid power system of solar, wind, and fuel cell power source unit for a given rural village in Ethiopia called Nifasso (latitude of 9°58′40″N and longitude of 39°50′3″E with an estimated population of 1059) that can meet the electricity demand in a sustainable manner has been studied. The main power for the hybrid system comes from the solar and wind energy while the fuel cell and rechargeable batteries are used as a secondary and primary energy back up units, respectively. We can say storage as primary and secondary based on the sequence of operation. Hence, when there is shortage, first the battery discharges to fulfill the load demand and if the battery reaches to its allowable minimum capacity, it will stop further discharging and the fuel cell will operate so as to convert the stored hydrogen into electricity. In the result, different feasible alternative solutions have been obtained with a narrow range of COE which are better than the previously studied PV-wind-Genset hybrid set ups. © 2018 Mikias Hailu Kebede and Getachew Bekele Beyene.",,"Economic analysis; Electric discharges; Energy utilization; Fuel cells; Hybrid systems; Planning; Rural areas; Secondary batteries; Wind power; Distributed generation system; Feasible alternatives; Fuel-cell power sources; International community; Renewable energy technologies; Solar and wind energies; Techno-economic feasibility; Technological development; Electric power system economics","Hailu Kebede, M.; Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Debre Berhan UniversityEthiopia; email: hailumikias@yahoo.com",,"Hindawi Limited",20900147,,,,"English","J.

The research examines the influence of installer businesses on rates of uptake and standards of installation, and the interplay between business practices and the policy environment. The research developed new detailed datasets through a nationwide survey, to which 388 installers responded, and follow-up interviews with 22 installers. Focusing on solar photovoltaics and air source heat pumps installed in households, the results show the fundamental dependence of installer businesses on government financial incentives and on the quality assurance scheme in operation. Market confidence was compromised by the sharp reduction in the Feed-In Tariff (FIT) for residential solar PV in 2012 and long delays to the equivalent Renewable Heat Incentive for residential installations. Nevertheless, more modest FIT levels have reduced the risk of sub-optimal installations and inappropriate specification of microgeneration systems. The findings underline the need for consistent policy to allow installer businesses and their supply chains to develop and mature, and thus facilitate commercial deployment of microgeneration of high quality, raise its competiveness with incumbent forms of energy supply and contribute to decarbonisation goals. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Air source heat pumps; Energy policy; Feed-In Tariff; Microgeneration; Solar PV; Subsidies","Energy policy; Heat pump systems; Heating; Housing; Quality assurance; Renewable energy resources; Solar power generation; Supply chains; Commercial deployment; Exploratory analysis; Feed-in tariff; Microgeneration; Microgeneration systems; Residential solar pv; Solar PVs; Subsidies; Air source heat pumps; energy policy; installation; photovoltaic system; power generation; pump; questionnaire survey; risk assessment; solar power; subsidy system; tariff structure; United Kingdom","Hanna, R.; Centre for Environmental Policy, Imperial College London, South Kensington CampusUnited Kingdom",,"Elsevier Ltd",09601481,,,,"English","Renew.

The deficit in electricity introduces a crisis in powering irrigation systems, which influences negatively the country's dominant income-generating sector, agriculture. Islanded microgrids with solar photovoltaic (PV) cells is one of the most attractive solutions for providing power to rural areas due to their cost-effectiveness, reliability and environment-friendly attributes. Therefore, a techno-economic feasibility study has been undertaken to investigate the prospects of renewable energy-based islanded microgrids to support rural electrification to power both households and irrigation systems. Three case studies based on the operation time of irrigation pumps during the day are developed using the HOMER Pro Microgrid Analysis Tool to identify the optimised configurations for the proposed system. The optimised configurations are then assessed considering the performance matrices of the cost of electricity (COE), net present cost (NPC), greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and renewable energy fraction (RF). From the analyses, it is perceived that the operation of irrigation pumps at different times of a day is a significant influence, and the optimum method considering techno-economical evaluation is to run the irrigation pumps during the daytime by solar PV. It is evident that the proposed islanded microgrid has significant potentialities in powering irrigation systems as well as rural electrification with low energy generation costs, a contribution to the reduction of global warming and to ameliorating the energy crisis in Bangladesh in order to achieve a sustainable future. © 2018 by the authors.

Its sustainability is widely confirmed in literature, however some countries present a growth very low in the last years. A new policy proposal is examined in this work. It aims to stimulate a new diffusion of PV plants in mature markets (e.g., Italy) regarding residential consumers. The subsidy is given to the amount of energy produced by PV plant for a period of 20 years (equal to its lifetime) and its value is calculated according to the scheme of European Emissions Trading System (EU ETS). Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) is used as economic method and two indexes are proposed: Net Present Value (NPV) and Discounted Payback Time (DPBT). The baseline case studies vary in function of two variables; (i) the share of self-consumption (30%, 40% and 50%) and (ii) the price of emissions avoided (10, 35 and 70 € per ton of CO2eq). Results confirms the environmental advantages of PV sources as alternative to the use of fossil fuels (685 gCO2eq/kWh) and economic opportunities are verified in several scenarios (from 48 €/kW to 1357 €/kW).

This paper presents the possibility of integrating a renewable energy system with an existing grid to meet electrical energy demand of institutional buildings located in Indian state of Tamil Nadu. Currently, the Tamil Nadu state electric-grid power is not surplus and experiencing 40% short fall in generation. In this present paper a modern approach for the optimum planning of electric power system (EPS) is proposed based on the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). An intertwined analysis on energy management and techno-economic optimization of grid connected renewable energy system is proposed. The prospects of different fixed tilt solar panels and peak load shifting based energy management are performed through HOMER Energy® simulation. The AHP multi-criteria decision analysis reveals that annual optimum tilt grid connected photovoltaic system is the optimum configuration for study location. The effectiveness of the AHP approach is evaluated with best-worst method and stochastic multi-criteria acceptability analysis for prioritizing the renewable energy system options in order to select best EPS. In addition, the optimum configuration is implemented in the institutional buildings and performance is analyzed under varying climatic conditions. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Analytic hierarchy process; Demand side management; HOMER; Multi-criteria decision analysis; Renewable energy system","Analytic hierarchy process; Decision making; Demand side management; Electric power systems; Electric power transmission networks; Electric utilities; Energy management; Energy management systems; Hierarchical systems; Photovoltaic cells; Renewable energy resources; Stochastic systems; Analytic hierarchy process (ahp); Electric power systems (EPS); Electrical energy demand; Grid-connected photovoltaic system; HOMER; Multi-criteria decision analysis; Renewable energy integrations; Renewable energy systems; Electric power system planning; alternative energy; analytical hierarchy process; building; demand analysis; demand-side management; electricity generation; energy planning; multicriteria analysis; optimization; photovoltaic system; sustainability; technical efficiency; India; Tamil Nadu","Manoharan, P.S.; Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Thiagarajar College of EngineeringIndia; email: psmeee@tce.edu",,"Elsevier Ltd",09601481,,,,"English","Renew.

The available literature show a high number of papers aiming at investigating solar heating and cooling systems based on heat driven and solar technologies, configurations, operating strategies, and financing issues. Nevertheless, none of the papers available in literature investigates the possibility to replace conventional solar thermal collectors by flat plat and concentrating photovoltaic/thermal systems, also producing renewable electricity. To cover this lack of knowledge, in this paper a dynamic simulation model of novel solar polygeneration heating and cooling systems is presented. Such dynamic simulation model is developed and implemented in a computer code, written in MatLab, and allows investigating the energy, economic and environmental performance of such novel solar polygeneration systems, based on both adsorption and absorption chiller technologies fed by dish-shaped concentrating and flat photovoltaic/thermal collectors. In order to show the potentiality of the presented tool, a comprehensive parametric case study is carried out to find out the optimal system configurations, as a function of crucial design and operating parameters and of weather conditions. The presented case study analysis refers to a small cluster of four buildings, including office and residential spaces, located in different European weather zones. The modelled solar polygeneration systems simultaneously produce electricity, space heating and cooling, and domestic hot water; electricity is self-consumed or delivered to the electrical grid. For comparative purposes, two different back-up system configurations, based on an electric chiller and a condensing gas-fired heater are also taken into account as conventional reference building-plant systems. By means of this systematic parametric analysis, comprehensive guidelines for system designers, practitioners and/or researchers focused on the development and use of solar heating and cooling systems are provided. © 2017","Adsorption and absorption chillers; Concentrating photovoltaic/thermal panels; Dynamic energy performance analysis; Flat plate photovoltaic/thermal panels; Solar heating and cooling systems","Absorption cooling; Adsorption; Cooling; Electric power generation; Energy efficiency; Environmental management; Environmental technology; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Heating; MATLAB; Refrigerators; Solar collectors; Solar heating; Solar power generation; Thermoelectric equipment; Absorption chillers; Concentrating photovoltaic; Dynamic energy; Photovoltaic/thermal; Solar heating and cooling; Cooling systems","Buonomano, A.; Department of Industrial Engineering, University of Naples Federico II, P.le Tecchio, 80, Italy; email: annamaria.buonomano@unina.it",,"Elsevier Ltd",13640321,,RSERF,,"English","Renewable Sustainable Energy Rev",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85034612618

The most feasible option is to provide off-grid electrification through renewable energy resources such as solar or wind energy. These intermittent sources do not promise a 24 X 7 supply system. Thus, along with solar or wind energy systems, it becomes important to use a renewable resource, such as biomass, which is available in abundance in rural areas. The need for battery energy storage becomes mandatory in order to store the surplus energy produced by renewable resources and supply it at a time of insufficiency. Currently, many battery technologies are evolving with better characteristics than conventional battery systems in terms of efficiency, response time, deep cycle discharge, lifecycle, etc. The aim of this study is, firstly, to design and model a hybrid renewable energy system (HRES), using photovoltaic (PV)-Biogas (BG) system with HOMER software. Secondly, we aim to test this model using three different battery types: advanced lead acid (LA) batteries, lithium ion (LI) batteries, and zinc-bromine (Zn-Br) ow batteries (FB), used individually. Using these three battery technologies, the HRESs are then compared in terms of system sizing, economy, technical performance, and environmental stability. A case study for the unelectrified village of Madhya Pradesh (MP) is discussed to suggest the practical aspect of the comparative analysis. The results demonstrate that the HRES using LI batteries is the most favorable choice. Using this configuration, the economic parameters, including total net present cost (NPC) and levelized cost of energy (LCOE), are found to be lowest. The technical parameters, including battery state of charge (SOC), capacity shortage, and environmental parameters (CO2 emissions) are found to be optimum. © TUBITAK.","Flow battery; Lead acid battery; Lithium ion battery; Optimization","Bromine compounds; Charging (batteries); Environmental technology; Flow batteries; Lead acid batteries; Lithium-ion batteries; Optimization; Rural areas; Wind power; Zinc compounds; Battery energy storage; Battery state of charge; Environmental parameter; Environmental stability; Hybrid Renewable Energy System (HRES); Hybrid renewable energy systems; Levelized cost of energies; Off-grid electrification; Battery storage","Tharani, K.L.; Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Bharati Vidyapeeth College of EngineeringIndia; email: kusum.tharani@rediffmail.com",,"Turkiye Klinikleri Journal of Medical Sciences",13000632,,,,"English","Turk J Electr Eng Comput Sci",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85044986214

However, charging EVs could have significant impacts on the electrical grid. One promising method for mitigating these impacts is the use of renewable energy systems. Renewable energy systems can also be useful for charging EVs where there is no local grid. This paper proposes a new strategy for designing a renewable energy charging station consisting of wind turbines, a photovoltaic system, and an energy storage system to avoid the use of diesel generators in remote communities. The objective function is considered to be the minimization of the total net present cost, including energy production, components setup, and financial viability. The proposed approach, using stochastic modeling, can also guarantee profitable operation of EVs and reasonable effects on renewable energy sizing, narrowing the gap between real-life daily operation patterns and the design stage. The proposed strategy should enhance the efficiency of conventional EV charging stations. The key point of this study is the efficient use of excess electricity. The infrastructure of the charging station is optimized and modeled. © 2018 by the authors.

Their influence on the market position of a dwelling is relatively unknown. Considering that expected lifespan of photovoltaic systems is at least 25 years, it is likely that many dwellings with a photovoltaic system will enter the housing market. Design/methodology/approach: Few houses with installed photovoltaic systems have been sold in the market to date. Lack of real market data imposes a method based on the stated preference data. Therefore, the general preferences toward photovoltaic systems are determined by a discrete choice model based on responses of 227 homebuyers in the Eindhoven region, The Netherlands. Further, the model estimates were used to assess the indirect willingness to pay for home photovoltaic systems. This initial willingness to pay is further reassessed with the direct willingness to pay collected in an open-ended questionnaire format. Findings: Results of the model show that the homebuyers’ preferences for home photovoltaic systems are large and significant. In addition to general preferences, this article reports on the taste heterogeneity carried out by separating observations based on the respondents’ characteristics. For example, photovoltaic systems are more appealing to homebuyers in more urban or central neighbourhoods. Further, the results of the direct survey lead to the conclusion that people are probably willing to pay close to the replacement value of the system and only 22 per cent of all respondents did not want to pay anything for the installed photovoltaic system. Research limitations/implications: These findings are exploratory and they raise a number of questions for further investigations, such as those regarding the real estate value of the installed photovoltaic systems. The reported findings must be regarded as local, thus further research is necessary to understand the impact on European housing markets. Practical implications: Preferences and willingness to pay for home photovoltaic systems can provide a variety of economic, social and political recommendations to different interested parties such as homeowners, buyers, realtors, retailers, energy companies and governments. For instance, a homeowner would like to know what would be the effect of a photovoltaic system on the housing market. Originality/value: As per the knowledge of authors, this is the first paper to estimate the impact of an installed photovoltaic system on housing choice, measured by stated choice data in the local housing market. It expands the existing body of knowledge for increasingly important issues of valuing and measuring preferences for photovoltaic systems installed on dwellings. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Housing preferences; Multinomial logit; Photovoltaic system; Sustainable transformation; Valuation; Willingness to pay",,"Glumac, B.; Urban Development and Mobility Department, Luxembourg Institute of Socio-Economic ResearchLuxembourg; email: brano.glumac@liser.lu",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",17539269,,,,"English","J.

Decreasing PV module costs and increasing residential electricity prices have made self-consumption of PV-generated electricity financially more attractive than exporting to the grid. Organic photovoltaics (OPV) are an emerging thin-film PV technology that shows promise of greatly improving the environmental and economic performances of PV technologies. Previous studies have estimated the current and future costs of OPV technologies, but the attractiveness of investing in OPV systems has not been evaluated under real market conditions, especially under PV self-consumption schemes. In this study, we investigate the self-consumption of electricity generation from conventional and organic PV systems installed at residential houses in two different countries, Denmark and Greece, under current PV regulatory frameworks. We then focus on modelling and assessing the cost-competitiveness of organic PV technologies based on cost estimations for existing pilot-scale (kW-range), and projected scale-up (100MW) and industrial-scale (100 GW) manufacturing capacity levels. Our generic results applying to all PV technologies show that PV systems installed at residential houses in Greece perform economically better than those in Denmark do in terms of self-sufficiency and gross electricity bill savings (i.e. excluding PV costs). Using the two country cases, which present very different settings, we characterise and discuss the influence of three key parameters of the economic performance of PV systems, namely the PV regulatory scheme, the solar irradiation level and the temporal match between the electricity consumption and solar irradiation profiles. Focusing on organic PV systems developed in an industrial-scale cost setting (1.53 €/Wp), we find that they deliver significant electricity bill savings for residential houses in Greece (38%) under current conditions, while they may not be sufficiently attractive for residential houses in Denmark (6.5%) due to mainly the different PV regulatory schemes. Based on these findings, we therefore recommend investors interested in renewable energy technologies to pursue scaling up the manufacturing capacity of OPV technologies, as well as assess a large number of countries to identify and prioritise financially attractive settings for PV self-consumption. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Cost optimization; Net-metering; Organic photovoltaics; Self-consumption","Commerce; Competition; Electric power generation; Environmental technology; Houses; Investments; Irradiation; Manufacture; Photovoltaic cells; Renewable energy resources; Solar radiation; Sustainable development; Cost optimization; Environmental and economic performance; Net metering; Organic photovoltaics; Renewable energy technologies; Residential electricity; Self- consumption; Solar irradiation profile; Costs; building; comparative study; cost analysis; electricity generation; energy resource; photovoltaic system; renewable resource; residential energy; residential location; self sufficiency; sustainability; Denmark; Greece","Chatzisideris, M.D.; Department of Energy Conversion and Storage, Technical University of DenmarkDenmark; email: madc@dtu.dk",,"Elsevier Ltd",03062619,,APEND,,"English","Appl.

Energy storage is a vital component required for overcoming the intermittency of solar PV. This study presents a priority-based demand response management (DRM) for loads with large time constants to create virtual energy storage. The virtual energy storage thus created can be used for partial levelling of intermittent output from solar PVs. The proposed DRM algorithm involves controlling loads with large time constants such as air conditioning systems and refrigerators based on the forecasted solar PV generation. The proposed method is evaluated using data-driven simulations, weather data and mathematical models. The proposed algorithm is highly suitable for megacities that have high number of multi-storey residential buildings. Utilising the virtual storage capacity available from the appliances will reduce the investment as well as the operation cost of renewable energy such as solar PV. Analyses on impact on temperature, percentage of interruptions, cost savings and impact on energy storage sizing are also presented for evaluating the performance of the proposed algorithm. © 2017 The Institution of Engineering and Technology.",,"Air conditioning; Cost benefit analysis; Digital storage; Energy storage; Investments; Photovoltaic cells; Storage management; Virtual storage; Data-driven simulation; Demand response; Large time constant; Renewable energies; Residential building; Solar photovoltaic system; Stability and reliabilities; Storage capacity; Solar power generation","Kandasamy, N.K.; School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological UniversitySingapore; email: nandha001@e.ntu.edu.sg",,"Institution of Engineering and Technology",17521416,,,,"English","IET.

With recent legislation for renewable energy in Portugal, which stimulates self-consumption (SC), PV energy is assumed as the most convenient technology to be applied for distributed generation. This paper evaluates the adequacy and potential impact of PV systems for self-consumption, using a techno-economic performance analysis. For that, real demand profiles from different sectors - residential, retail, hotels and industrial consumers - and simulated solar PV production profiles for different locations, are considered, regarding different panel orientations and tilts. To assess the optimum prosumer profile, discounted payback time (DPBT) and interest rate of investment (IRR) are used as reference metrics. The SC drivers found are tariff and the demand pattern, but also the remuneration of the solar energy surplus. Accommodation and Retail sectors are the prosumers that present the best energy and economic results, with DPBT of 3–6 years and IRR from 17% to 27%, for optimal orientation and location. Given the diversity of domestic consumers, the best prosumers are found for flat or profiles with diurnal occupation, with a self-consumption of 17% and a DPBT of 7 years. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Electricity demand; Renewable energy sources; Self-consumption; Solar photovoltaic","Investments; Renewable energy resources; Solar concentrators; Solar energy; Developed countries; Distributed energies; Electricity demands; Industrial consumers; Renewable energy source; Self-consumption; Solar photovoltaic energies; Solar photovoltaics; Solar power generation","Neves, D.; IN+, Instituto Superior Técnico, Av.

WTP is a waste stream with continuous availability and negative cost, but it is difficult to handle, as it contains fecal matter. The process we explored had two stages: WTP gasification followed by direct conversion into electricity in a high-temperature solid-oxide fuel cell (SOFC). The process was studied on a 10 ktpa scale by using real-life parameter values obtained from industrial sources. We presented the basic system design, as well as its electricity yield and overall efficiency on the basis of detailed mass- and energy-balance calculations. By explorative technoeconomic analysis and sensitivity analysis, we found an electric efficiency of 57 %, which is similar to that of a natural gas combined cycle plant. The levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) was 20.3 ¢ kWh−1, which is comparable at present to that of residential photovoltaic installations. The system's capital costs are relatively high, mainly as a result of SOFC investment costs, but we expect these costs to decrease as the market of cells develops. The operating costs are relatively low, partly thanks to the high thermodynamic efficiency (≈70 %). Currently, the fuel costs are negative (because we use waste as a raw material), yet this could change if the value of WTP would increase as a result of this process. Learning effects could make the system more competitive in the future with an LCOE of approximately 11 ¢ kWh−1. © 2017 The Authors. Published by Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

From a consumer perspective, the financial benefits of lower utility costs and the potential of a financial return through providing grid services is a strong incentive to invest in PV-battery systems. Although battery storage is generally considered an effective means for reducing the energy mismatch between photovoltaic supply and building demand, it remains unclear when and under which conditions battery storage can be profitably operated within residential photovoltaic systems. This fact is particularly pertinent when battery degradation is considered within the decision framework. In this work, a commercially available coupled photovoltaic lithium-ion battery system is installed within a mid-sized UK family home. Photovoltaic energy generation and household electricity demand is recorded for more than one year. A comprehensive battery degradation model based on long-term ageing data collected from more than fifty long-term degradation experiments on commercial Lithium-ion batteries is developed. The comprehensive model accounts for all established modes of degradation including calendar ageing, capacity throughput, ambient temperature, state of charge, depth of discharge and current rate. The model is validated using cycling data and exhibited an average maximum transient error of 7.4% in capacity loss estimates and 7.3% in resistance rise estimates for over a year of cycling. The battery ageing model is used to estimate the cost of battery degradation associated with cycling the battery according to the power profile logged from the residential property. A detailed cost-benefit analysis using the data collected from the property and the battery degradation model shows that, in terms of utility savings and export revenue, the integration of a battery yields no added benefit. This result was, in-part, attributed to the relatively basic control strategy and efficiency of the system. Furthermore, when the cost of battery degradation is included, the homeowner is subject to a significant financial loss. © 2017 The Authors","Battery degradation; Lithium ion battery; Photovoltaic; Solar power",,"Uddin, K.; WMG, The University of WarwickUnited Kingdom; email: k.uddin@warwick.ac.uk",,"Elsevier Ltd",03062619,,APEND,,"English","Appl.

Panel-level PV monitoring system needs to be low-cost so that it can be widely deployed. Synchronization of monitoring time between PV panels is also needed to compare them under the same conditions. Simple fault detection scheme is needed to decide which PV panel is abnormal. For low-cost modules, this paper proposes a low-cost power line communication (PLC) module to monitor four PV panels simultaneously. It can reduce the cost of monitoring modules down to nearly one fourth according to the cost analysis. For time synchronization, a measurement and query scheme is proposed. At the measurement phase, the states of PV panels are measured simultaneously; at the query phase, the measured data are transferred one by one. For fault detection, the mean voltage of PV panels and voltage drop threshold are used. Voltages below the mean by the threshold are considered as abnormal. The proposed system was tested in the real field; it found and localized an abnormal PV panel. The proposed scheme is expected to widely spread the panel-level PV monitoring and help maintain the PV system performance. © 2017 IEEE.","Home Energy; Low-Cost Monitoring; Photovoltaic System; Power Line Communication; User-friendly","Carrier transmission on power lines; Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Fault detection; Photovoltaic cells; Home Energy; Low costs; Photovoltaic systems; Power line communications; User friendly; Monitoring","Han, J.; Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute (ETRI)South Korea; email: hanjinsoo@etri.re.kr",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",00983063,,ITCED,,"English","IEEE Trans Consum Electron",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85040676846

Most studies, which address this issue, focus solely on economic aspects and neglect the influence of individual electricity consumption behaviour and consumer preferences on the individual benefit of a self-consumption system. Yet, preferences and behaviour have a significant impact in the market uptake of new technologies, as can be seen in the current sales figures of batteries for the purpose of self-consumption enhancement. The technology is purchased, even though it is still far from economically viable. In this study, a market diffusion model is proposed that is based on 415 individual electricity load profiles, which define the homeowners’ consumption behaviour. Additionally, the results of a market survey are included to explicitly model different user groups and map their varying willingness to pay. The results show that homeowners who are likely to adopt a self-consumption technology are on average characterised by higher annual electricity consumption. The consumption behaviour, and therefore the load profiles are heterogeneous within each user group and therefore, also the individual utility of a battery for self-consumption enhancement differs significantly. The results show that the suggested modelling approach is able to explain the past development of battery installations in private households in Germany. Up until 2030, the model simulations suggest a moderate development of battery enhanced self-consumption, resulting in a battery of 2 GW h in private households in 2030. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Battery; Consumer preferences; Household survey; Market diffusion; PV; Self-consumption","Commerce; Economics; Electric batteries; Electric power utilization; Surveys; Annual electricity consumption; Battery; Consumer preferences; Economically viable; Electricity-consumption; Household surveys; Self-consumption; Sustainable energy systems; Diffusion; consumption behavior; electricity generation; energy use; household survey; installation; numerical model; photovoltaic system; simulation; sustainability; willingness to pay; Germany",,,"Elsevier Ltd",03062619,,APEND,,"English","Appl.

In this work, we examine the effectiveness of Robust Optimization (RO) in maximizing the economic benefit of the owner of a home battery storage system in the presence of uncertainty in dynamic electricity prices. The advantage of the robust model is that it keeps its linear class, thus it is not too computationally intensive to be included in the control algorithm of a residential energy storage controller. In the usecase, the aggregating entity makes requests for flexibility and coordinates 100 such devices using a price signal, while the storage controller is doing dynamic electricity price arbitrage.

Of particular interest are solar energy systems based on hybrid photovoltaic-thermal (PV-T) collectors, which can reach overall efficiencies of 70% or higher, with electrical efficiencies up to 15–20% and thermal efficiencies in excess of 50%, depending on the conditions. In most applications, the electrical output of a hybrid PV-T system is the priority, hence the contacting fluid is used to cool the PV cells and to maximise their electrical performance, which imposes a limit on the fluid's downstream use. When optimising the overall output of PV-T systems for combined heating and/or cooling provision, this solution can cover more than 60% of the heating and about 50% of the cooling demands of households in the urban environment. To achieve this, PV-T systems can be coupled to heat pumps, or absorption refrigeration systems as viable alternatives to vapour-compression systems. This work considers the techno-economic challenges of such systems, when aiming at a low cost per kW h of combined energy generation (co- or tri-generation) in the housing sector. First, the technical viability and affordability of the proposed systems are studied in ten European locations, with local weather profiles, using annually and monthly averaged solar-irradiance and energy-demand data relating to homes with a total floor area of 100 m2 (4–5 persons) and a rooftop area of 50 m2. Based on annual simulations, Seville, Rome, Madrid and Bucharest emerge as the most promising locations from those examined, and the most efficient system configuration involves coupling PV-T panels to water-to-water heat pumps that use the PV-T thermal output to maximise the system's COP. Hourly resolved transient models are then defined in TRNSYS, including thermal energy storage, in order to provide detailed estimates of system performance, since it is found that the temporal resolution (e.g. hourly, daily, yearly) of the simulations strongly affects their predicted performance. The TRNSYS results indicate that PV-T systems have the potential to cover 60% of the combined (space and hot water) heating and almost 100% of the cooling demands of homes (annually integrated) at all four aforementioned locations. Finally, when accounting for all useful energy outputs from the PV-T systems, the overall levelised cost of energy of these systems is found to be in the range of 0.06–0.12 €/kW h, which is 30–40% lower than that of equivalent PV-only systems. © 2017 The Authors","Absorption refrigeration; Heat pumps; Photovoltaic-thermal systems; Solar energy; Solar heating and cooling","Absorption cooling; Absorption refrigeration; Collector efficiency; Cooling; Digital storage; Electric power systems; Fossil fuels; Heat pump systems; Heat storage; Heating; Location; Photovoltaic cells; Refrigeration; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Urban planning; Absorption refrigeration system; Electrical performance; Heat pumps; Levelised cost of energies; Photovoltaic thermals; Renewable energy integrations; Solar heating and cooling; System configurations; Cooling systems","Ramos, A.; Clean Energy Processes (CEP) Laboratory, Department of Chemical Engineering, Imperial College LondonUnited Kingdom; email: a.ramos-cabal@imperial.ac.uk",,"Elsevier Ltd",01968904,,ECMAD,,"English","Energy Convers.

High fluctuations in power generation could make the introduction of dynamic end-consumer electricity pricing reasonable. Furthermore, the prediction of end-consumers’ power consumption would get easier when charging the maximum power capacity, instead of the consumed energy. Thus, this paper discusses the capability of smart buildings to cope with such market models and evaluates how the design of the electrical and thermal energy system of a modern German building is affected. Therefore, cost optimal sizing of the main supply system components is carried out based on a hybrid MILP and a heuristic optimization algorithm. The results indicate that local photovoltaic generation is beneficial in almost all market conditions, while except for the capacity market, batteries are only economical if prices decrease by more than 60%. The identified electricity price dynamics are too low to incentivize investments into load shifting capable supply or storage systems. Nevertheless, if an installed heat pump and the associated thermal storage have smart home capabilities, they support the maximization of PV self-consumption and reduce electricity cost. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Capacity market; Cost optimization; Demand side management; Dynamic electricity pricing; Electricity market; Smart grid","Automation; Commerce; Costs; Demand side management; Economics; Electric industry; Electric power transmission networks; Heat storage; Integer programming; Intelligent buildings; Investments; Optimization; Power markets; Structural design; Capacity markets; Cost optimization; Electricity prices; Electricity pricing; Heuristic optimization algorithms; Photovoltaic generation; Smart grid; Thermal energy systems; Smart power grids; building; cost analysis; demand-side management; electricity; energy market; market conditions; optimization; photovoltaic system; power generation; price dynamics; smart grid; thermal power","Wolisz, H.; RWTH Aachen University, E.ON Energy Research Center, Institute for Energy Efficient Buildings and Indoor ClimateGermany; email: hwolisz@eonerc.rwth-aachen.de",,"Elsevier Ltd",03605442,,ENEYD,,"English","Energy",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85021236388

Smart municipal energy grids will have an important role in future electricity markets, due to their flexibility to utilize excess electricity production from CHP and variable renewable energy sources through heat storage. This flexibility enables the levelized costs of energy within smart municipal energy grids to decrease below electricity market prices even in case of fuel price disturbances.

However, the charging and discharging power cannot be adjusted to the power fluctuations without any time delay so that an inherent temporal mismatch between the battery power and the residual power (PV output minus load) occurs under dynamic conditions. This paper presents a simulation study analyzing the response time-induced mismatch losses of grid-connected PV-battery systems. Firstly, the response time issue is analyzed theoretically to reveal how the energy flows between the household and the grid are changed due to the delayed battery response. Then, measurements are presented to show the dynamic behavior of two different PV-battery systems. The experimental results reveal settling times of up to 7 s to reach the steady state after an abrupt step change in the load demand. Thirdly, simulations of an AC-coupled PV-battery system are carried out with a time step size of 1 s. A sensitivity analysis is conducted to identify the impact of the dynamic response on the annual amount of energy exchanged with the grid. It is found that longer response times are accomplished by an increase in the grid feed-in and grid supply as well. Consequently, a slow-reacting battery system diminishes the economic benefit for the owner of the PV-battery system. In order to improve the transparency from the end-customeŕs point of view, response time-related specifications should be stated in the data sheets of the products in the future. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Battery storage; Control system; Electric energy storage; PV-battery system; Response behavior","Control systems; Delay control systems; Digital storage; Electric energy storage; Housing; Response time (computer systems); Secondary batteries; Sensitivity analysis; Abrupt step changes; Battery energy storage; Battery systems; Photovoltaic systems; Power fluctuations; Residential building; Response behavior; Simulation studies; Battery storage","Weniger, J.; HTW Berlin – University of Applied Sciences, Department 1 – Energy and InformationGermany; email: pvstorage@htw-berlin.de",,"Elsevier Ltd",2352152X,,,,"English","J.

Houses with south, south-east and south-west facing roofs are considered eligible for the retrofit since solar irradiation is maximum on south facing surfaces in the northern hemisphere. The PV system is used to produce electricity and supply the electrical demand of the house, with the excess electricity sold to the grid in a net-metering arrangement. The BIPV/T system produces electricity as well as thermal energy to supply the electrical as well as the thermal demands for space and domestic hot water heating. The PV system consists of PV panels installed on the available roof surface while the BIPV/T system adds a heat pump, thermal storage tank, auxiliary heater, domestic hot water heating equipment and hydronic heat delivery system, and replaces the existing heating system in eligible houses. The study predicts the energy savings, GHG emission reductions and tolerable capital costs for regions across Canada. Results indicate that the PV system retrofit yields 3% energy savings and 5% GHG emission reduction, while the BIPV/T system yields 18% energy savings and 17% GHG emission reduction in the Canadian housing stock.

Distribution network operators (DNO) are investing in an advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) to enable cost reduction through smart grid applications. The DNO also benefits from the additional measurement data the AMI gives for the network planning process. The availability of AMI data can be limited by the cost of communication and by privacy concerns. To determine the social welfare of an AMI, the economic gains should be estimated. For the planning of the low voltage (LV) network, a method for determining the value of an AMI still needs to be developed. Therefore, a planning methodology which allows various levels of measurement data availability has been developed. By applying this approach the value of different levels of AMI from an LV-network planning perspective can be determined. To illustrated the application of this approach a case study for the LV-network of a Dutch DNO is performed. The results show that an increase in measurement data can lead to €49-254 lower LV-network reinforcement costs.

Furthermore, energy saving potentials through refurbishment of the building envelope are investigated. The analysis is based on simulations with an experimentally validated PVT model. The major novelty of the study is that the water based PVT collectors are also used for long wave radiative cooling. Three different residential case study buildings from Central to Southern European climate zones are investigated. Their heat, cooling and electricity demand, as well as their renewable supply, are determined along with savings through the envelope measures. In general, the performance of the PVT system varies strongly with the boundary conditions of the demand profile, climate situation and energy price levels. The results demonstrate that PVT collectors used for heat (primary DHW) and electricity offer approximately 6–7 percentage points higher exergetic efficiency than thermal and PV collectors equally sharing the available surface area. Raising the temperature level for cooling by 4 K increases the amount of renewable cooling by a factor 2–4. The analysis shows that the economic performance of the trigeneration PVT system is only better than separate generation if the additional electricity and cooling generate enough benefit to compensate the loss of heat gains. Especially in the Portuguese location of Almada, with high electricity price levels and high enough cooling demand, the application of PVT in a trigeneration system is recommendable from an exergetic and economic point of view. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Direct trigeneration; Exergy; Hybrid photovoltaic thermal collector; PVT; Radiative cooling; Residential building; Retrofitting","Energy conservation; Exergy; Housing; Retrofitting; Solar collectors; Solar power generation; Energy saving potential; Exergetic efficiency; Photovoltaic collectors; Photovoltaic thermals; Radiative cooling; Residential building; Tri-generation; Trigeneration systems; Collector efficiency","Gürlich, D.; University of Applied Sciences Stuttgart, Research Centre for Sustainable Energy Technologies zafh.net, Schellingstr. 24, Germany; email: daniel.guerlich@hft-stuttgart.de",,"Elsevier Ltd",03787788,,ENEBD,,"English","Energy Build.",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85028373065

By the end of 2016, the global installed solar photovoltaic capacity reached 305 GW. Its growth is impressive in the last years; in fact, it was only equal to 41 GW in 2010. However, Europe has installed only 6.9 GW in 2016 (-1.7 GW in comparison to previous year) and this annual power installed is equal to 9% of global one in according to data released by Solar Power Europe.

This work proposes a mathematical model, in which a Discounted Cash Flow analysis is conducted to evaluate the financial feasibility of photovoltaic-integrated lead acid battery systems in Italy. The indicator used is Net Present Value. Furthermore, a break-even point analysis, in terms of an increase of self-consumption, is conducted. The residential sector is investigated and energy storage system investment is incentivized by fiscal deduction and regional subsidies. The analysis provides several case studies, determined by combinations of the following variables: photovoltaic plant size, battery capacity, the increase of the share of self-consumption, and the useful lifetime of energy storage system.

The problem of electricity and water supply are more pronounced in remote areas due to lack of utility grid extension. This study examines the feasibility of using hybrid energy system consisting of solar PV and biodiesel generators in meeting the electricity and domestic water needs of a remote community in Ghana. The Hybrid Optimization Model for Electric Renewable (HOMER) software was used to carry out the analysis presented in this study. A daily electrical load of 104 kWh/day to meet the need of 100 households, small-scale businesses and a central water pumping system is estimated. Five different initial investment support scenarios, are considered: 100%, 75%, 50%, 25% and 0%. The results show a rather poor load profile (load factor of 12.26%) and a levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) of US$0.76/kWh at full cost (100% cost). The LCOE declines to US$.20/kWh when the entire upfront cost of the project is grant-financed. Compared with end-user tariff of US$0.10/kWh for lifeline customers in Ghana, beneficiaries of this PV-based mini-grid system will pay up to 200% more, even under full-grant finance conditions for maintenance of the system. Such interventions often replace inferior and health-threatening options such kerosene lamps, candles and in some cases outright darkness.

A photovoltaic-wind turbine-fuel cell-solar-thermal collector system is designed and an economic model is introduced for supplying the residential thermal and electrical loads via the grid-connected hybrid system. Since determining the optimal operation of a hybrid system such as a combined heat and power system constitutes a complex optimization problem requiring a sophisticated optimization method, a modified heuristic approach-based particle swarm optimization is proposed for solving the optimization problem. The results are compared with those obtained by an efficient metaheuristic optimization method, namely a genetic algorithm, in terms of accuracy and run time. The results show that, using the grid-connected hybrid combined heat and power system, among the cases considered, decreases the total cost of the system.

This problem could cause damage on components such as transformers and distribution lines provoking triggering the system protections that would eventually lead to system failures. The economic and environmental implications related to reinforcing of the existing network, make this option not the immediate solution for implementation. Installation of battery energy storage systems (BESS) and control of active power curtailment (APC) would be another option to phase the upcoming problems. In this paper a forecast for the year 2035 in a real residential area in Switzerland was investigated, where large amount of PV panels are expected to be installed. This project investigates different solutions based on BESS and APC to deal with the inevitable increase of power flow in the network. The solutions presented here, prevent the overload in a distribution system transformer and avoid excess power flows on the lines. For a given set of demand and PV production curves, simulations in Matlab were performed and computations of optimal power flows were calculated.

The SH has a variety of sources that include photovoltaic (PV) panels, diesel generator (DG), and plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) as an energy storage, and also it can transact power with the local distribution company (DISCO). Herein, the appliances of the SH are categorized into non-deferrable and deferrable appliances, and also the deferrable appliances are divided into two groups with hour-scale and day-scale deferrable features. The challenges of the problem include modeling the economic and technical constraints of sources and appliances and addressing the variability and uncertainties concerned with the power of PV panels that make the problem a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP), time-varying (dynamic), and stochastic optimization problem. In this study, a multi-time scale stochastic model predictive control (MPC) and a combination of genetic algorithm (GA) and linear programming (GA-LP) are applied to address the above mentioned issues and solve the problem.

One such application is residential energy storage combined with solar photovoltaic (PV) panels to enable higher self-consumption rates, which has become financially more attractive recently due to decreasing feed-in subsidies. Although residential energy storage solutions are commercially mature, it remains unclear which system configurations and circumstances, including aggregator-based applications such as the provision of ancillary services, lead to profitable consumer investments. Therefore, we conduct an extensive simulation study that is able to jointly capture these aspects. Our results show that, at current battery module prices, even optimal system configurations still do not lead to profitable investments into Li-Ion batteries if they are merely used as a buffer for solar energy. The first settings in which they will become profitable, as prices are further declining, will be larger households at locations with higher average levels of solar irradiance. If the batteries can be remote-controlled by an aggregator to provide overnight negative reserve, their profitability increases significantly. © 2017 by the authors.","Ancillary services; Economics; Lithium-ion batteries; Solar photovoltaics","Battery storage; Economics; Housing; Investments; Ions; Profitability; Remote control; Solar concentrators; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Ancillary service; Battery energy storage; Extensive simulations; Optimal system configuration; Residential energy; Solar photovoltaics; Storage solutions; System configurations; Lithium-ion batteries","Goebel, C.; Department of Business Information Systems, Technical University of Munich, Boltzmannstr. 3, Germany; email: christoph.goebel@tum.de",,"MDPI AG",19961073,,,,"English","Energies",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85036657298

Treating wastewater is necessary to preserve the water bodies; reusing treated wastewater appears a viable option that could help to address future water challenges. In areas already suffering energy poverty, the main barrier to wastewater treatment is the high electricity demand of most facilities. This work aims to assess the benefits of integrating renewable energy technologies to satisfy the energy needs of a wastewater treatment facility based on a conventional activated sludge system, and also considers the case of including a membrane bioreactor so treated wastewater can be reused for irrigation. Using HOMER, a software tool specifically developed for optimal analysis of hybrid micro-generation systems, we identify the optimal combination of renewable energy technologies for these facilities when located in a specific water-stressed area of Sub-Saharan Africa and assess whether the solutions are cost-effective. The analysis shows investment in renewable technologies is cost-effective when the true cost of electricity or average days of power outages per year are considered. Integration of photovoltaic panels, a wind turbine and internal combustion engine fuelled by biogas produced by anaerobic digestion can cover between 33% and 55% of the electricity demand of the basic wastewater facility, at a levelised cost of energy lower than the true cost of electricity. In the case of water reuse, the techno-economically viable solutions identified by HOMER can cover 13% of energy needs. Finally, we discuss how the proposed solutions could provide a large contribution to socio-political security, in both domestic and cross-border contexts. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","HOMER; Renewable technologies; Socio-political security; Sub-Saharan Africa; Wastewater treatment; Water energy nexus","Activated sludge process; Anaerobic digestion; Biological water treatment; Bioreactors; Climate change; Cost benefit analysis; Cost effectiveness; Costs; Economics; Electric power utilization; Internal combustion engines; Investments; Outages; Photovoltaic cells; Population statistics; Reclamation; Renewable energy resources; Wastewater reclamation; Wastewater treatment; Water conservation; Wind turbines; HOMER; Renewable technology; Socio-political security; Sub-saharan africa; Water energy; Water treatment","Brandoni, C.; Centre for Sustainable Technologies, School of the Built Environment, Ulster UniversityUnited Kingdom; email: c.brandoni@ulster.ac.uk",,"Elsevier Ltd",09596526,,JCROE,,"English","J.

Buildings, owing to their energy intensive operation, are imposing significant energy, environmental and economic burdens for the country. To overcome these challenges and improve the sustainability levels in the building and energy sectors, it has been decided to develop 9500 MWs of renewable energy projects by 2023. Given the annual solar radiation level of over 2200 kWh/m2, solar energy is expected to play the predominant role in achieving this target. Traditionally, KSA's emphasis has been to pursue large-scale energy projects. Globally, however, small scale and building related projects have significantly contributed to the rapid growth of solar energy. Application of solar technologies in buildings is one of the important areas that has been ignored in the country. This paper explores the potential for rooftop solar photovoltaic (PV) in KSA's residential sector. Taking into account appropriate PV design considerations and local building construction and cultural practices, it calculates the power generation potential for 13 major cities. It is found that a total of 51 TWh of electricity can be annually generated from these cities, accounting for 30% of the total domestic demand.

The proposed virtual prototyping routine is employed to carry out a comparative study of the potential of Si and SiC semiconductors in a 10-kW residential three-phase photovoltaic inverter application. For this purpose, a state-of-the-art hard-switched three-level Si insulated-gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) system is compared to a hard-switched and to a soft-switched two-level SiC MOSFET system. The candidate systems for each concept are selected among the η-ρ-σ Pareto-optimized designs based on the life cycle costs. The hard-switched two-level SiC candidate system is found to be the most attractive solution featuring the lowest life cycle costs. When compared to the Si-based candidate system, not only a better power density and efficiency result. At the same time, besides the lower life cycle costs (-22%), lower component costs (-5%) can also be attained.

Meteorological data (such as: global solar radiation, Wind speed, Wind direction, air temperature and relative humid-ity) was measured at Ouled Fares site in Chlef, between 1st January 2015 and 31st December 2015. The monthly average global solar radiation measured at the Ouled Fares site during this period ranged from 2.387 kWh/m2/d to 7.322 kWh/m2/d. The monthly average Wind speeds ranged between 1.328 m/s and 3.404 m/s. The objective of this study was the optimization of a hybrid Photovoltaic-Wind-Diesel power system. Simulation software HOMER was used to find out if the hybrid system performed comparably in terms of technical and economic feasibility to a conventional system connected to the grid. The study found that the Photovoltaic-Diesel-Battery system was the most economic power system, it produced 30,472 kWh/y with COE 0.224 $/kWh. The proposed system comprised of 20 kW of PV panels, one Diesel generating 2.5 kW rated power and 36 batteries of nominal capacity 4 kWh. It was noted that 96% (29,144 kWh/y) of energy was produced by the Photovoltaic generator and 4% (1,328 kWh/y) was produced by the generator, which worked 586 h/y with a consumption of 449 L/y. The Diesel price of 0.70 US$ per liter was considered fixed and without fluctuations. The hybrid system was able to meet energy requirements (load of 19,781 kWh/y) of the village with 15.1% energy in excess (4,593 kWh/y). The proposed system avoided over 28.39 kg/y of CO2 less emissions for the local atmosphere of the site and would save 22.59 barrel/y of fossil fuel.

In all these cases, improving payback time and energy production for PV installations is a very complex design tradeoff that involves multiple variables such as irradiance fluctuations, inverter efficiency, operating temperature variation, and PV panel type. In this paper, a detailed multivariate study of PV plant design is presented, resulting in an improved technique to increase the potential benefits of solar plants with lower capital costs. This new approach includes detailed consideration of the probabilistic hourly temperature and solar irradiation profile of the installation site, the efficiencies and operating areas of different grid-tie inverters, and detailed models of different PV modules in the optimal design process. The harvested energy, total costs, and payback time are the objective functions in this approach, while the number of series and parallel panels, the tilt angle, and inverter topology and PV module type are determined from a list of possible candidates. The optimization process is implemented for a sample system, and the results are compared to both a traditional and design software approach. It is seen that by applying the proposed approach with lower capital costs, the harvested energy, financial benefits, and the payback time can be improved by 9.3%, 1%, and 6.95%, respectively.

PV sources are able to achieve a greater energy independence, to tackle the climate change and to promote economic opportunities. This work proposes an economic analysis based on well-known indicators: Net Present Value (NPV), Discounted Payback Time (DPBT) and Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE). Several case studies are evaluated for residential households. They are based on three critical variables: plant size (1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 kW), levels of insolation (1350, 1450 and 1550 kWh/(m2xy)) and share of self-consumption (30%, 40% and 50%). The profitability is verified in all case studies examined in this work. The role of self-consumption, that is the harmonization between demanded and produced energy, is strategic in a mature market to improve financial performance. A sensitivity analysis, based on both electricity purchase and sales prices (critical variables), confirms these positive results. The Reduction in the Emissions of Carbon Dioxide (ERcd) signifies an environmental improvement when a PV system is used as an alternative to a mix of fossil fuels. Finally, a policy proposal is examined based on a fiscal deduction of 50% fixing the period of deduction equal to 5 years. © 2017 by the authors.

In order to achieve the strategic targets of solving China's energy poverty, realizing basic energy service equalization, and comprehensively building up a moderately prosperous society, several policies have been successively promulgated in recent years, which aim to solve the electricity access issue for residents living in remote and less developed areas. It is of great importance to determine the most economical mode of power supply in remote and less developed areas, which directly affects the economic efficiency of public investment projects. Therefore, this paper focuses on how to select the most economical power supply mode for rural electrification in China. Firstly, the primary modes to supply electricity for residents living in the remote and less developed areas are discussed, which include power grid extension mode and micro-grid mode. Secondly, based on the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) technique, the life cycle economic cost accounting model for different power supply modes are built. Finally, taking a minority nationality village in Yunnan province as an example, the empirical analysis is performed, and the LCOEs of various possible modes for rural electrification are accounted. The results show that the photovoltaic (PV)-based independent micro-grid system is the most economical due to the minimum LCOE, namely 0.658 RMB/kWh. However, other power supply modes have much higher LCOEs. The LCOEs of power grid extension model, wind-based independent micro-grid system and biomass-based independent micro-grid system are 1.078 RMB/kWh, 0.704 RMB/kWh and 0.885 RMB/kWh, respectively. The proposed approach is effective and practical, which can provide reference for rural electrification in China. © 2017 by the authors.","China; Economicalmode; Levelized cost of electricity (LCOE); Power supply; Rural electrification","biomass; electricity supply; empirical analysis; energy market; life cycle analysis; power generation; rural electrification; smart grid; sustainable development; village; China; Yunnan","Guo, S.; School of Economics and Management, North China Electric Power UniversityChina; email: guosen@ncepu.edu.cn",,"MDPI AG",20711050,,,,"English","Sustainability",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85020017570

The Directive on Energy Performance of Buildings establishes a benchmarking system known as cost-optimality to set minimum energy performance requirements in new and existing buildings. This paper applies the cost-optimal methodology to an existing structure located in the Mediterranean area (Southern Italy). The building is composed of two units that have been considered for different uses: hotel and multi-residential. Several energy efficiency and renewable measures have been implemented both individually and as part of packages of measures. The cost-optimal solution has been identified as able to optimize energy consumption and costs from financial and macroeconomic perspectives. The first reference building (hotel use) shows a maximum reduction of primary energy and CO2 emission of about 42%, falling within the CasaClima energy class D, while the second reference building (residential use) achieves a value of 88% for primary energy and 85% for CO2 emissions, falling into class B. Thermal dispersions through the envelope can be limited using a suitable combination of insulating materials while a variety of technical variants are selected, such as VRF (variant refrigerant flow) systems, heat pumps with fan coils associated with controlled mechanical ventilation, solar thermal and photovoltaic. This paper illustrates the development of energy retrofit projects, in order to reach a balance between efficiency measures and costs for a building having two different uses, providing guidance to similar case studies related to a warm climate. © 2017 by the authors.

This system enhances the quality of the current smart grid system. This program encourage two-ways interaction between the consumer and the utility provider. The consumers are required to reduce their load consumption upon request by the utility provider, thus avoiding them from paying for the high load demand. However, the current design of DRP is seem to put the user at disadvantages. Thus, deployment of the new practice equipped with renewable energy sources will make the system more user-friendly. As DRP prove to be beneficial in many terms, this project is conducted to find DRP relevancy to be implemented in Universiti Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia (UTHM). According to the electrical consumption data disclosed by Facility Management Division, the power consumed by UTHM is remarkably high especially during 11.00am to 12.00 pm. Thus, DRP is being proposed to be put into practise during this period. Nonetheless, it is not economically wise to implement the program to the whole campus. Therefore, three buildings with the most power consumption had been chosen for this study. They are the library, Faculty of Civil and Environmental Engineering (FKAAS) building and Faculty of Technology and Vocational Education (FPTV) building. The building power consumption and economic evaluation had been analysed using HOMER simulation. From the analysis, the combination of FPTV and FKAAS had been chosen for DRP implementation. The reason are, these buildings have superiority over the library in term of reliability and effectiveness. In terms of economy, it is almost equivalent to each other. © 2017 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

Solar PV has reached price parity at the retail level where the electricity price charged includes both transmission and distribution costs, in addition to the wholesale price. So the economic rationale for paying a FiT premium above market rates to achieve dynamic efficiency is no longer warranted. However, there is justification pay a premium to encourage dynamic innovation in energy storage. Socially, FiTs can be a problem because they can transfer wealth from poorer to richer households. Additionally, new investment in distribution and transmission, driven by peak demand spikes from air conditioners can act as a further transfer. Environmentally, FiTs can also fall short of their full potential to cut emissions if they lack ‘time of use’ price signals that reflect movements in the wholesale price. We suggest a sustainable flexible price regime that can be designed to addresses all three areas of concern: social, environmental and economic. The resultant transmission and distribution investment deferment would meet both environmental and economic objectives. We argue that the time has come to design a sustainable flexible price regime for solar PV that focusses upon allocative efficiency as an explicit goal and to introduce support for other distributed resources including energy storage to encourage dynamic efficiency. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Energy policy; Feed in tariff; Photovoltaic; Renewable energy; Solar power","design; electric vehicle; energy efficiency; energy policy; photovoltaic system; solar power; sustainable development; tariff structure; Australia","Foster, J.; Energy Economics and Management Group, School of Economics, University of QueenslandAustralia; email: j.foster@uq.edu.au",,"Springer New York LLC",13876996,,,,"English","J.

The strategy takes the status of the electricity grid into consideration (via grid thresholds) and aims at both favouring self-consumption of the electricity produced from renewables and minimizing the negative impact of local power generation on the grid operation. It is based on anticipating the total-occupant load of the building, the grid load as well as the variable power that comes from renewables, using a rolling forecast horizon. Note that we have previously proposed a non-predictive strategy and pointed out possible improvements, in particular regarding the management of the batteries (Chabaud et al., 2015). So, a grid-connected residential building located in Perpignan (southern France) has been modelled using the TRNSYS software. Performance has been evaluated thanks to energy and economic criteria. Taking a look at the results we have obtained in simulation, one can highlight configurations that offer a good compromise between self-consumption of electricity and the renewable energy coverage rate. The combination of photovoltaic solar panels and a vertical-axis wind turbine has been highlighted as a viable energy mix option for residential buildings in southern France. Clearly, optimally designing and managing the power generators and batteries added to the building using the predictive strategy improve the way that building and the electricity grid interact. In particular, the batteries are better handled, allowing electricity to be injected to the grid and extracted from the grid at more favourable times. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Distributed generation; Electricity storage; Grid-connected mode; Predictive strategy; Residential building","Buildings; Distributed power generation; Electric batteries; Electric energy storage; Electric power generation; Energy resources; Housing; Solar cell arrays; Solar concentrators; Solar power generation; Wind turbines; Economic criteria; Electricity storages; Grid-connected modes; Predictive strategy; Renewable energies; Residential building; Rule-based strategy; Vertical axis wind turbines; Electric power transmission networks","Grieu, S.; PROMES-CNRS, Rambla de la Thermodynamique, Tecnosud, France; email: stephane.grieu@promes.cnrs.fr",,"Elsevier Ltd",22106707,,,,"English","Sustainable Cities Soc.",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85010204469

We in this paper investigate the problem of finding the optimal capacities of PV and ES systems in the context of home load management in smart grids. Unlike existing studies on optimal sizing of PV and ES that have been treated as a part of designing hybrid energy systems or polygeneration systems that are stand-alone or connected to the grid with a fixed energy price, our model explicitly considers the varying electricity price that is a result of individual load management of the customers in the market. The problem we have is formulated by a D-day capacity planning problem, the goal of which is to minimize the overall expense paid by each customer for the planning period. The overall expense is the sum of expenses to buy electricity and to install PV and ES during D days. Since each customer wants to minimize his/her own monetary expense, their objectives look conflicting, and we first regard the problem as a multi-objective optimization problem. Additionally, we secondly formulate the problem as a D-day noncooperative game between customers, which can be solved in a distributed manner and, thus, is better fit to the pricing practice in smart grids. In order to have a converging result of the best-response game, we use the so-called proximal point algorithm. With numerical investigation, we find Pareto-efficient trajectories of the problem, and the converged game-theoretic solution is shown to be mostly worse than the Pareto-efficient solutions. © 2017 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Capacity planning; Home load management; Multi-objective optimization; Noncooperative game; Photovoltaic (PV) generation and energy storage (ES) systems; Smart grids","Costs; Economics; Electric energy storage; Electric load management; Electric power plant loads; Electric power transmission networks; Energy management systems; Game theory; Housing; Multiobjective optimization; Pareto principle; Renewable energy resources; Sales; Storage management; Capacity planning; Multi-objective optimization problem; Noncooperative game; Pareto efficient solutions; Photovoltaic generation; Proximal point algorithm; Residential photovoltaic; Smart grid; Smart power grids","Kim, D.; Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Hanyang UniversitySouth Korea; email: dkim@hanyang.ac.kr",,"MDPI AG",19961073,,,,"English","Energies",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85022024371

However, as more attention is being focused globally on the development of building-integrated PV systems, the technical, the economic as well as the environmental assessment of these systems is crucial to ascertain their viability. The purpose of this paper is to present an economic and environmental analysis of relatively small rooftop PV-grid-interconnected energy systems of 2–10 kWp rated power, located in Athens, Greece. The techno-economic feasibility of the PV systems is conducted employing the computerized renewable energy technologies assessment tool ‘RETScreen’. The energy and environmental assessment of the systems is carried out employing SimaPro 7.1 software, which is a standard Life Cycle Assessment tool. The results of the economic analysis indicate that with the current prices, investment in PV-grid-interconnected systems with power capacity higher than 5 kWp is in general viable. However, an increase in energy sale prices and/or cost reductions in the production of PV systems are crucial for the successful development of small-scale residential size PV systems in the country. The environmental analysis reveals that the PV systems with higher rated power perform worse as far as the environmental impact is concerned. The critical phase of the life cycle of PV systems is the module manufacturing process, which is characterized by high electricity consumption, representing most of the environmental impact. Nevertheless, it is further shown that the application of PV technology presents important environmental benefits compared to conventional energy production systems. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Building-integrated renewable energy systems; Economic aspects; Environmental aspects; Life cycle assessment; PV system","Cost reduction; Costs; Economic analysis; Economics; Electric power system economics; Electric power system interconnection; Electric power transmission networks; Environmental impact assessments; Environmental technology; Fossil fuels; Greenhouse gases; Investments; Life cycle; Photovoltaic cells; Renewable energy resources; Building integrated; Economic aspects; Environmental aspects; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); PV system; Environmental impact","Dedoussis, V.; Department of Industrial Management & Technology, University of Piraeus, 80 Karaoli & Dimitriou st., Greece",,"Elsevier Ltd",03787788,,ENEBD,,"English","Energy Build.",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85009986901

Solar energy is one of the most favourable alternative resources in terms of cleanness, safety and the economic and environmental aspects. However, the intermittent nature of solar energy and the lack of high solar radiation intensities in various climates favour the use of various energy storage techniques to eliminate the discrepancy between energy supply and demand. The current work presents an analysis and evaluation of the performance of an underground soil-based thermal energy storage system for solar energy storage, coupled with a combined heat and power generation system. A combined PV-Air Source Heat Pump (ASHP) system is utilized to fulfil heating and electricity needs of a housing project in Odense, Denmark, in addition to charging the soil storage medium in summer months when excess electric power is generated. The stored heat is discharged in December and January to provide the space heating and domestic hot water demands of the residential project without the utilization of an external heating source. Employing a PV system of 30 kW capacity, it was found that a storage medium of 900 m3 of soil is capable of providing the heating needs for a housing project of 1000 m2 internal floor area. The year round transient behaviour of the thermal energy storage medium is reported in addition to the heat losses and the surrounding soil temperature variation throughout the year. It was found that the overall system heating coefficient of performance is around 4.76, where the reported energetic efficiency is 5.88% for the standalone PV system, 19.1% for the combined PV-ASHP system, and 22.2% for the combined PV-ASHP system employing a seasonal underground thermal energy storage block. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Air-source heat pump; PV system; Seasonal storage; Soil; Solar energy; Underground thermal energy storage","Cogeneration plants; Economics; Electric energy storage; Energy storage; Fossil fuel deposits; Fossil fuels; Heat pump systems; Heat storage; Heating; Housing; Pumps; Soils; Solar energy; Temperature; Thermal energy; Thermography (temperature measurement); Analysis and evaluation; Combined heat and power generation; Environmental aspects; PV system; Seasonal storage; Solar radiation intensity; Stand-alone PV systems; Thermal energy storage systems; Air source heat pumps","Jradi, M.Campusvej 55, Denmark; email: mjr@mmmi.sdu.dk",,"Elsevier Ltd",13594311,,ATENF,,"English","Appl Therm Eng",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85003875031

PV battery systems allow consumers to reduce their dependence on the local electricity supplier at lower or equivalent costs. However, the profitability of PV battery systems depends greatly on the local meteorological conditions and the local electricity retail tariff. In central European countries, PV battery systems generate and store less electricity in winter months due to lower irradiation. The battery, in particular, can be reserved to provide ancillary services during winter months and thereby improves the overall systems economics. In this study, a large dataset consisting of individual load profiles is used to simulate a virtual power plant which provides ancillary services during battery idle times. The results show that participants with large batteries can greatly increase their overall systems economics by participating in reserve markets. However, participants with small battery capacities may not be able to recover the additional costs for communication with the virtual power plant and are thus not suitable candidates to provide grid stabilizing services (ancillary services). © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Frequency regulation; Photovoltaics; Self-consumption; Stationary battery storage; Virtual power plant","Costs; Electric utilities; Frequency regulations; Photovoltaics; Self-consumption; Stationary batteries; Virtual power plants; Electric batteries","Schopfer, S.; Chair of Information Management, Department of Management, Technology and Economics, ETH Zürich, Weinbergstr. 58, Switzerland; email: sandro.schopfer@ethz.ch",,"Springer Verlag",18652034,,,,"English","Comput.

In Latin America, however, cost and regulation are still barriers for their widespread adoption, particularly by residential and commercial customers. In Costa Rica, there has only recently been interest in rooftop PV systems thanks to a major pilot project carried out from 2010 to 2015 by the Costa Rican Institute of Electricity (Instituto Costarricense de Electricidad, ICE), the administrator of the generation, the transmission system operator, and one of the eight distribution network operators (DNOs) who also supply electricity. The hundreds of installations involved in this project created the momentum needed by the local emerging PV industry to push for changes in the regulatory framework and demonstrate the economic benefits, given the relatively high electricity prices. Although this project represented only a modest PV penetration, ICE recognized that the ability of distribution circuits to host rooftop PV systems should be adequately assessed. This prompted the Ministry of Energy and Environment to create a new and important requirement for Costa Rican DNO s: the generation-hosting capacity of distribution circuits should be quantified considering a comprehensive set of studies, with most of them requiring detailed network models. © 2017 IEEE.",,"Electric power transmission; Geographic information systems; Commercial customers; Distribution circuits; Distribution network operators; Energy and environment; Photovoltaic systems; Regulatory frameworks; Technological advances; Transmission system operators; Economics",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",15407977,,,,"English","IEEE Power Energ.

The ability to control the timing and magnitude of the aggregate electricity consumption of buildings is acquiring critical relevance. Buildings play a pivotal role in defining the shape and composition of the final electricity demand, and have an impact on the existing and projected electrical system infrastructure. This paper proposes distributed electrical storage using electrical batteries at the residential level, as an economical and technically feasible way to introduce a degree of responsiveness with the demand of residential buildings without compromising the comfort of users. The objective of the paper is to devise the operative principles governing the relation between the grid operator and a community of low exergy (lowEx) buildings, under the assumption that the grid operator is interested in controlling the form of the aggregate electricity consumption in that community. This paper presents a pricing policy aimed to stimulate a power-aware consumption, and consequently peak-shave the total electricity profile. The introduced pricing scheme separately addresses energy and power, and provides an incentive for buildings to invest in decentralized generation and storage technologies. The paper presents a methodology to determine the optimal amount of decentralized electrical storage and PV necessary to meet the objectives of the grid operator and allowing users to obtain a profit from the dynamic electricity tariff. A model is used to determine the optimal battery and PV investment from the perspective of the user. The analyses show that the introduced electricity tariff triggers an equilibrium, in which users invest between 20% and 25% of the total incurred cost in battery and PV. The PV and the battery input power were found to be mainly related to the objective of reducing the energy cost. On the other hand, the battery capacity and output power were found to be associated with the peak reduction objective. Users invest less than 10% of the total battery investment share in the battery input power. This fact indicates that contrary to a battery usage driven by the price volatility, which is proposed in many models, the battery is mainly used as power-to-energy buffer. Energy is slowly stored in the battery and rapidly released at critical peak hours. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Battery; Decentralized storage; Demand response; Low exergy (lowEx) buildings; Optimization; PV","Aggregates; Buildings; Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Economics; Electric batteries; Electric energy storage; Electric power utilization; Exergy; Grid computing; Housing; Investments; Optimization; Power management; Battery; Decentralized generation; Demand response; Distributed electricity storages; Dynamic Electricity Tariffs; Electricity-consumption; Low exergies; Operative principles; Electric power transmission networks; decentralization; demand analysis; demand-side management; electrical power; energy conservation; energy use; investment; optimization; photovoltaic system; pricing policy; residential energy","Sandoval, D.; Chair of Building Systems, ETHZ, John-von-Neumann Weg 9, Switzerland; email: dsandovalv@gmail.com",,"Elsevier Ltd",03062619,,APEND,,"English","Appl.

In addition, modern net-zero energy buildings with such CHP, photovoltaic (PV) systems, and absorption chillers (AbCs) can maximize electrical and thermal energy efficiency as they can reuse wasted heat from CHP systems with AbCs and renewable energy from PV systems.

A typical two-bedroom household within the eThekwini municipality in the city of Durban, South Africa, is considered. The aim is to assess the potential of energy cost saving and cost effectiveness the system can achieve under the new residential feed-in tariff (FIT), referred to as residential embedded generation tariff. Simulation results show that a potential of 69.41% energy cost saving and payback period (PBP) of 19 years can be achieved under the current FIT. By increasing the current FIT by 58%, the energy cost saving is increased by 22.8%, while the period is decreased to 14 years. When the FIT is increased by 71.25% from its current value, a 75% increase in the cost saving is achieved with a PBP of 8.6 years. However, it is shown that the higher the FIT the lesser the need for a battery bank if grid failures are not considered as a constraint. The impact of battery storage and grid electricity price on the profitability of the grid-interactive solar PV system is also analyzed. It is shown that the use of battery storage system will have a positive effect on the system profitability only when the FIT is not attractive. For attractive FITs, the use of battery storage will have a negative effect on the profitability of the grid-interactive solar PV system. Simulation results also show that the higher the grid electricity price the higher the profitability of the system. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Economic analysis; Feed-in tariff; Grid-interactive solar PV; Optimal energy cost; Residential electricity customers","Cost effectiveness; Costs; Economic analysis; Electric batteries; Electric power transmission networks; Housing; Investments; Profitability; Battery storage system; Durban , South Africa; Embedded generation; Energy cost savings; Feed-in tariff; Optimal energy; Residential electricity; Solar PVs; Cost benefit analysis; cost-benefit analysis; energy efficiency; photovoltaic system; residential energy; smart grid; solar power; storage; Durban; eThekwini; KwaZulu-Natal; South Africa","Numbi, B.P.; Centre for the Development of Green Technologies, Department of Electrical Engineering, Mangosuthu University of Technology, 511 Mangosuthu Highway, Umlazi, 4031, P.O.

The work was built upon previous related site surveys and data collections from each site. Verification of the site data sets, simulation of different operational scenarios, and a comparison with the optimum design were all considered in the work. This includes all possible standalone diesel generators, hybrid PV/diesel/battery, and 100% PV/battery scenarios for the proposed stations. HOMER software has been used in the modeling entire systems. The operational behaviors of different PV penetration levels were analyzed to accurately quantify the impact of PV integration. The performance of these stations was analyzed based on technical, economic and environmental constraints, besides, placing emphasis on comparative cost analysis between different operational scenarios. The results satisfied the load demand with the minimum total net present cost (NPC) and levelized cost of energy (LCOE). Moreover, sensitivity analysis was carried out to represents the effects of changing main parameters, such as; fuel, PV, battery prices, and load demand (load growth) on the system performance. Comparison of all operational behaviors scenarios was carried out to elucidate the advantages/disadvantages of utilizing each scenario. The impact of different PV penetration levels on the system performance and the generation of harmful emissions is also investigated. The results show more trends towards using renewable energy (RE) sources in energy generation and less dependence on standalone diesel generators. Hybrid PV/Diesel/Battery system is seen to be the best technical performance compared to all other scenarios, while also reporting good economic and environmental performance, which result in increased system sustainability. The 100% RE system showed the best environmental characteristics with the highest costs.

The manifold BESS deployed to date rely on a variety of different battery technologies, show a great variation of battery size, and power electronics dimensioning. However, given today's high investment costs of BESS, a well-matched design and adequate sizing of the storage systems are prerequisites to allow profitability for the end-user. The economic viability of a PV-BESS depends also on the battery operation, storage technology, and aging of the system. In this paper, a general method for comprehensive PV-BESS techno-economic analysis and optimization is presented and applied to the state-of-art PV-BESS to determine its optimal parameters. Using a linear optimization method, a cost-optimal sizing of the battery and power electronics is derived based on solar energy availability and local demand. At the same time, the power flow optimization reveals the best storage operation patterns considering a trade-off between energy purchase, feed-in remuneration, and battery aging. Using up to date technology-specific aging information and the investment cost of battery and inverter systems, three mature battery chemistries are compared; a lead-acid (PbA) system and two lithium-ion systems, one with lithium-iron-phosphate (LFP) and another with lithium-nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC) cathode. The results show that different storage technology and component sizing provide the best economic performances, depending on the scenario of load demand and PV generation. © 2017 by the authors.","Battery aging; Battery energy storage system; Cost analysis; Economic analysis; Linear programming; Lithium-Ion battery; Photovoltaic panel; Residential battery; Size optimization","Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Economic analysis; Economic and social effects; Electric load flow; Housing; Investments; Iron compounds; Lead acid batteries; Linear programming; Lithium compounds; Lithium-ion batteries; Photovoltaic cells; Power electronics; Solar energy; Battery aging; Battery energy storage systems; Cost analysis; Photovoltaic panels; Residential battery; Size optimization; Battery storage","Hesse, H.C.; Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Technical University of Munich (TUM)Germany; email: holger.hesse@tum.de",,"MDPI AG",19961073,,,,"English","Energies",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85025478335

This paper presents a methodology for policymakers in such conditions to examine more precisely the financial performance of residential solar PV from the consumer perspective as part of an ex-ante policy assessment. We model a range of prospective policy scenarios and compare policy mechanisms that compensate homeowners for generation, those that reduce their upfront costs, and those that assist with financing, using Ireland as a case study. The results confirm the intuitive notion that more generous financial remuneration schemes provide quicker payback; however we observe that in low irradiance regions there is little difference between upfront grants and feed-in-tariffs to accelerate payback timeframes. We also show the importance of retail tariff structure in consumer payback for solar PV systems, with one-part tariffs generating shorter paybacks than two-part tariff structures, although the latter is more likely to secure revenue for electricity infrastructure investment. Drawing from this analysis, the paper proposes some options for the design of policy supports and tariff structures to deliver a sustainable residential renewable electricity system in low-irradiance regions. © 2017","Distributed generation; Electricity rate structure; Energy economics; Energy policy; Financial performance; Residential solar PV","Distributed power generation; Economics; Energy policy; Finance; Housing; Investments; Solar power generation; Electricity demands; Electricity infrastructure investments; Electricity rate structure; Energy economics; Financial performance; Remuneration schemes; Renewable electricity; Residential solar pv; Electric power generation; economic impact; electricity generation; energy market; energy policy; energy use; performance assessment; photovoltaic system; solar power","Ryan, L.; UCD Energy Institute, Belfield, Ireland; email: lisa.ryan@ucd.ie",,"Elsevier Ltd",03014215,,ENPYA,,"English","Energy Policy",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85026262942

Under the support of the national emerging industry, China's PV industry has experienced a dramatic development over recent years, catapulting into a vital position in the world PV market. The newly installed PV capacity has led to cost reductions. This paper chooses the methodology of techno-economic evaluation to analyze current market application of residential PV power generation, including grid-connected and off-grid systems. One of the main innovations is choosing five Chinese cities in different areas of solar radiation as research objects, which enables regional differentiation in calculating levelized cost of energy (LCOE). The results show that grid-connected PV systems with 3 kW PV modules can meet the electric demand of a 60–90 m2 residential building. The capacity of off-grid systems are 5–10 kW, which is determined by local solar radiation. By incorporating a learning curve, we forecast that off-grid PV systems for each of the five cities will reach grid parity over the next several decades.

The CO-based scheduling algorithm minimizes the monthly electricity expenses of a customer who owns an ESS and incorporates both a time-of-use volumetric tariff and a demand charge tariff. Further, we propose the novel idea of a “supply charge” tariff that incentivizes ESS customers to store excess solar PV generation that may otherwise result in reverse power flow in the distribution grid. By means of a case study we observe the CO-based daily charge/discharge schedules reduce (1) peak net demand (that is, load minus PV generation) of the customer, (2) power fluctuations in the customer net demand profile, and (3) the reliance of the customer on the grid by way of promoting energy self-consumption of local solar PV generation. Two alternate methods for behind-the-meter ESS scheduling are considered as benchmarks for cost minimization, peak net demand reduction, and mitigation of net demand fluctuations. The algorithm is tested using real 30-min interval residential load and solar data of 53 customers over 2-years. Results show that the CO-based scheduling algorithm provides mean peak net demand reductions between 46% and 64%, reduces mean net demand fluctuations by 25–49%, and increases the mean solar PV self-consumption between 24% and 39% when compared to a customer without an ESS.

A computational algorithm easy on resources is developed in this work to evaluate the effects of distribution network on the annual energy yield of residential PV systems under scenarios of increasing PV penetration. A case study was conducted for residential PV systems in Newcastle upon Tyne with a generic UK distribution network model. Results identified penetration levels at which PV generation curtailment would occur as a consequence of network voltage rise beyond grid limits and the variation in the percentage of annual energy yield curtailed among the systems connected to the network.

In this work, we present an optimal control model for studying the economic and grid interaction benefits of smart charging of electric vehicles (EV), vehicle-to-grid, and space heating load control for residential houses with on-site photovoltaics (PV). A case study is conducted on 1–10 net zero energy houses with detailed empirical data, resulting in 8–33% yearly electricity cost savings per household with various electric vehicle and space heating system combinations. The self-consumption of PV is also significantly increased. Additional benefits through increasing the number of cooperating households are minor and saturate already at around 3–5 households. Permitting electricity transfer between the houses and EV charging stations at workplaces increases self-sufficiency significantly, but it provides limited economic benefit. The additional cost savings from vehicle-to-grid compared to smart charging are minor due to increased battery degradation, despite a significant self-sufficiency increase. If the optimization is conducted without taking the battery degradation cost into account, the added monetary value of vehicle-to-grid can even be negative due to the unmanaged degradation.

Economic performance results of the residential and commercial PV systems were obtained and presented in geo referenced information systems (GIS) maps. The results show that almost all the country exhibits a great potential, obtaining in several locations an IRR higher than the reference value (5%/yr.) for both schemes (residential and commercial), highlighting that the central-north region reaches the highest IRR values.

However, not all models consider the operation of the PV – battery storage system with a feed-in tariff (FiT) incentive, different electricity rates and battery storage unit cost. An electricity customer whose electricity demand is supplied by a grid connected PV generation system benefiting from a FiT incentive is simulated in this paper. The system is simulated with the PV modelled as an existing system and the PV modelled as a new system. For a better understanding of the existing PV system with battery storage operation, an optimisation problem was formulated which resulted in a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problem. The optimisation model was developed to solve the MILP problem and to analyse the benefits considering different electricity tariffs and battery storage in maximising FiT revenue streams for the existing PV generating system. Real data from a typical residential solar PV owner is used to study the benefit of the battery storage system using half-hourly dataset for a complete year. A sensitivity analysis of the MILP optimisation model was simulated to evaluate the impact of battery storage capacity (kWh) on the objective function. In the second case study, the electricity demand data, solar irradiance, tariff and battery unit cost were used to analyse the effect of battery storage unit cost on the adoption of electricity storage in maximising FiT revenue. In this case, the PV is simulated as a new system using Distributed Energy Resources Customer Adoption Model (DER-CAM) software tool while modifying the optimisation formulation to include the PV onsite generation and export tariff incentive.

The number of mobile subscriptions in Ghana rose from 11,570,430 subscriptions in 2008 to 35,802,135 by early 2016. This growth is however challenged by the high and increasing cost of electricity supply to cell sites, particularly off -grid locations. Added to this challenge is the need to reduce the ecological footprint of business operations. In this paper, we assess the viability of using a solar PV-diesel hybrid power system as an alternative electricity supply to off -grid outdoor Base Transceiver Stations (BTS) in Ghana. The BTS are typically powered by diesel generators.

In each jurisdiction, for a range of PV and storage system sizes, we compute the optimal use of the system, and hence the best possible profitability of that system in that jurisdiction over a 20 year life span. This methodology allows us to quantitatively estimate the influence of a jurisdiction on the (best possible) profitability of PV-storage systems.

However, in the light of rising retail electricity prices and falling costs for rooftop solar installations in recent years, policy makers and regulators face the difficult task of deciding when and how these schemes should be amended or phased out. To understand how such actions might shape the role of residential solar and the resulting economics in a changing electricity system, we study how the design of FiR schemes affects optimal PV system sizes. To illustrate our approach, we draw on empirical data on the FiR policies of Net Metering and Feed-in Tariffs from California and Germany between 2005 and 2016. Using a techno-economic model and a conceptual framework, we show that FiR design and its interplay with retail electricity prices and PV system costs jointly determine whether residential PV installations are economic, how they are sized, and which prosumer paradigms they spur. Our analysis holds numerous implications for policy makers and advisors responsible for redesigning or adapting existing FiR mechanisms, as well as for the stakeholders of an emerging ecosystem based on residential solar PV. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Feed-in remuneration; Feed-in Tariff; Net Metering; Prosumer; Residential solar photovoltaics","Costs; Decision making; Economics; Housing; Solar concentrators; Conceptual frameworks; Electricity prices; Feed-in tariff; Net metering; Prosumer; Residential solar pv; Solar photovoltaics; Techno-economic model; Solar power generation; energy policy; photovoltaic system; residential energy; solar power; California; Germany; United States; Abies","Ossenbrink, J.; Group for Sustainability and Technology, D-MTECSwitzerland; email: jossenbrink@ethz.ch",,"Elsevier Ltd",03014215,,ENPYA,,"English","Energy Policy",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85020477217

With the widespread integration of smart meters, consumers can leverage the high temporal resolution of energy consumption data to optimize a PV system based on their individual circumstances. In this article, such an optimization strategy is developed to enable the optimal selection of size, tilt, azimuth and retail electricity plan for a residential PV system based on hourly consumption data. Hourly solar insolation and PV array generation models are presented as the principal components of the underlying objective function. A net present value analysis of the potential monetary savings is considered and set as the optimization objective. A particle swarm optimization algorithm is utilized, modified to include a penalty function in order to handle associated constraints. The optimization problem is applied to real-world Australian consumption data to establish the economic performance and characteristics of the optimized systems. For all customers assessed, an optimized PV system producing a positive economic benefit could be found. However not all investment options were found to be desirable with at most 77.5% of customers yielding an acceptable rate of return. For the customers assessed, the mean PV system size was found to be 2 kW less than the mean size of actual systems installed in the assessed locations during 2015 and 2016. Over-sizing of systems was found to significantly reduce the potential net benefit of residential PV from an investor's perspective.

Operation of the charging station is managed in such a way that it is either supplied by photovoltaic (PV) power or the power grid, and the vehicle-to-grid (V2G) is also implemented for improving the stability of the grid during peak load hours. The PV interfaced DC/DC converter and grid interfaced DC/AC bidirectional converter share a DC bus. A smooth transition of one operating mode to another demonstrates the effectiveness of the employed control strategy. Modelling and control of the different components are explained and are implemented in Simulink. Simulations illustrate the feasible behaviour of the charging station under all operating modes in terms of the four-way interaction among PV, EVs and the grid along with V2G operation. Additionally, a business model is discussed with comprehensive analysis of cost estimation for the deployment of charging facilities in a residential area. It has been recognized that EVs bring new opportunities in terms of providing regulation services and consumption flexibility by varying the recharging power at a certain time instant.

Coal combustion for heating of every house in ""Ger"" district is main reason. One way to reduce the air pollution is mass usage of electric heater. However, there are several difficulties such as overload and degradation of transformers and other equipment used in distribution and transmission systems as well as power shortage occurrence in evening peak period due to residential consumption. This study aims to contribute for solving the air pollution and power shortage problem in Mongolia. One possible solution could be distributed generation (DG) with photovoltaic (PV) penetration. In this study, PV with energy storage (ES) hybrid system to reduce peak load is analyzed. We proposed the suitable structure of PV-ES hybrid for Mongolian household, and suggested several operation scenarios. Optimal operation algorithm is carried out based on a comparison aspect from economical, grid impact and PV penetration possibility. The economic analyse shows annual income of 520USD, and has a payback period of 8 years for selected scenario. The proposed PV-ES system structure is verified by experimentation set on the building rooftop in city center. The suggested scenario is planned to apply for system in further research.

The designated system would satisfy the energy requirements of 248 kWh/day primary load with 44.41 kW peak load. The optimized hybrid system consists of a biogas generator (9 kW), PV modules (10 kW), 2 diesel generators (10 kW each), 72 batteries (390Ah each), and 15 kW inverters.

For wider adoption of PV systems, there is a need for an accurate sizing and economic assessment tool to inform decision makers. In this study, we propose a new optimization model based on integer programming for the adoption of stand-alone PV systems in the residential sector. The proposed model not only determines the optimal number of PV modules and batteries but also assesses the economic feasibility of the system through annualized cost. The model takes into account site-specific data in finding the optimal sizes. The effectiveness of the proposed model is assessed through a case study in Bursari, Nigeria. The result obtained from the model reveals that establishing a solar PV system is not only environmentally friendly but also about 30% cheaper than the diesel generators that are currently in use at Bursari. In particular, annually about 361 USD per residential building could be saved if the proposed system is used to replace the diesel generators. Finally, this study also provides valuable managerial insights about the effect of several parameters on the performance of the proposed PV system. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Battery storage; Integer programming; Optimal sizing; Optimization; Residential building; Stand-alone photovoltaic system","Battery storage; Decision making; Digital storage; Energy conversion; Housing; Optimization; Photovoltaic cells; Solar power generation; Conversion technology; Economic feasibilities; Optimal sizing; Residential application; Residential building; Solar photovoltaic system; Stand alone photovoltaic system; Stand-alone PV systems; Integer programming; assessment method; building; decision making; feasibility study; numerical model; optimization; performance assessment; photovoltaic system; residential location; solar power; Nigeria","Solyalı, O.; Business Administration Program, Middle East Technical University, Northern Cyprus Campus, Kalkanli, Turkey; email: solyali@metu.edu.tr",,"Elsevier Ltd",03605442,,ENEYD,,"English","Energy",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85015670398

Little is known about how the new utility pricing structures will affect the adoption rates of these technologies, as well as the ability of utilities to prevent widespread grid defection. We present a system dynamics model that predicts the retail price of electricity and the adoption rates of residential solar photovoltaic and energy storage systems. Simulations are run from the present day to the year 2050 using three different utility business models: net metering, wholesale compensation, and demand charge. Validation results, initialized with historical data for three different cities, agree well with expert forecasts for the retail price of electricity. Sensitivity analyses are conducted to investigate the likelihood of a “utility death spiral”, which is a catastrophic loss of business due to widespread grid-defection. Results indicate that a utility death spiral requires a perfect storm of high intrinsic adoption rates, rising utility costs, and favorable customer financials. Interestingly, the model indicates that pricing structures that reduce distributed generation compensation support grid defection, whereas pricing structures that reward distributed generation (such as net metering) also reduce grid defection and the risk of a death spiral. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Distributed generation; Renewable energy; Residential energy storage; Residential solar PV; Utility death spiral","Costs; Digital storage; Distributed power generation; Electric energy storage; Electric utilities; Energy storage; Housing; Renewable energy resources; Sales; Sensitivity analysis; Solar concentrators; Solar power generation; Electricity storages; Energy storage systems; Renewable energies; Residential energy; Residential photovoltaic; Residential solar pv; System dynamics model; Utility death spiral; Population statistics; compensation system; demand-side management; electricity generation; electricity industry; energy balance; model validation; photovoltaic system; price dynamics; sensitivity analysis; technology adoption; utility sector","Epps, B.P.; Thayer School of Engineering, Dartmouth College, 14 Engineering Dr., United States; email: brenden.epps@dartmouth.edu",,"Elsevier Ltd",03062619,,APEND,,"English","Appl.

As a case study, 5 levels of consumers’ response capability, 32 combinations of PV installed capacities and battery capacities were analyzed and inter-compared using the developed model. The results show that: (i) the consumers with higher response capability are able to accept larger PV capacity because the marginal revenue of new installed PV for smart consumers decreases much more slowly compared to that of a common consumer; (ii) the consumers with higher response capability need less batteries to promote PV economic acceptability; (iii) the consumers with higher response capability can meet the electricity demand in real-time with least expenditure, so they get more ultimate benefit from the games. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Complementarity model; Demand response; Distributed PV; Non-cooperative game; Real-time pricing","Automation; Economics; Electric batteries; Intelligent buildings; Photovoltaic cells; Complementarity models; Demand response; Distributed PV; Noncooperative game; Real time pricing; Game theory; demand-side management; electricity generation; electricity industry; electricity supply; energy market; photovoltaic system; pricing policy; real time; theoretical study","Zhang, Q.; Academy of Chinese Energy Strategy, China University of Petroleum-Beijing, Changping, China; email: zhangqi@cup.edu.cn",,"Elsevier Ltd",03062619,,APEND,,"English","Appl.

A model was developed for optimizing the operation of HPWHs using 24 h advance forecasting of electricity consumption and PV generation. The goal was to minimize electricity charges by optimizing the operation of actual HPWHs. Annual electricity consumption data from 357 houses fitted with both PV and an HPWH were used in the study. Optimal operation of an HPWH was shown to yield average cost savings of $58 or 7% of the electricity cost in conventional operation. HPWH electricity consumption was reduced by 11% on average, compared with conventional operation, because running the heat pumps during the daytime increases their efficiency. A simple modification, in which the start of HPWH operation depended on the level of available sunlight, yielded a comparable average saving of $53 per year. A comparison was made with the use of battery systems. The self-consumption ratio increased from 32% in conventional operation to 45% by optimizing the operation of the HPWH, which was similar to the effect of introduction of a 2–4 kW h battery.

Most of the remote rural areas of Ethiopia are not yet electrified. Electrifying these remote areas by extending grid system is difficult and costly. Melkey Hera village is one of a rural community situated in western Ethiopia. In this village, extension of the grid is not yet practical. As the current international trend in rural electrification is to utilize renewable energy resources; solar, wind, biomass, and micro hydro power systems can be seen as alternatives. Therefore, the target of this paper is to investigate the viability of a micro hydro, Photo Voltaic (PV) and Diesel Generator-battery hybrid power system options to come up with the best techno-economic and optimum configuration for supplying electricity to this village. The study was performed by an assessment of the predicted village energy demand, the available renewable energy resources, and then using the software called HOMER. The best hybrid system type was described and the optimization of the system configuration was also done. Furthermore, through the simulation of different configuration of the supply system, the optimal mini-grid hybrid system design was established to combine hydro, solar PV, battery energy storage and diesel generator. This system demonstrated to be more reliable in operation, and the most cost-effective for the required level of service. The role of energy storage in system operation also demonstrated to offer additional operational advantages in-terms of reliability and cost savings. Overall, the design results show that the majority of energy obtained from hydropower, which accounts 79%, the PV module covers 20%, and diesel generator is only 1% of the total load consumption. The obtained hybrid system is cost competitive with $0.133/kWh, which is somewhat good to satisfy the community needs. However, this is more than current energy price in Ethiopia which is $0.06/kWh. If due-merit given to the electricity deficiency of the country, it would play major role in improvement of life quality of community living in rural areas. From environmental standpoint, the renewable fraction of the project is 99%, which shows the system is environmentally friendly. Finally, this study identified that off grid hybrid micro hydro-PV-DG-battery bank energy system is cost effective and environmentally friendly in delivering power for rural areas far from the grid.

Although the increase of decentralised solar PV is seen as progressive for sustainable development, it is not without financial implications for electricity utilities. There is a concern in South Africa that allowing rooftop solar PV connection to the grid will reduce electricity sales for local governments and thus their revenue streams from electricity. An investigation was carried out to examine the financial impact that increasing installations of grid-connected rooftop PV at a household level might have on local governments in South Africa. Stellenbosch Municipality was used as a case study, and two different approaches were used. The first considered the maximum grid capacity for distributed generation, as determined by the South African grid standards. The second was based on individual households that would gain the most financial benefit from investing in rooftop PV. The outcome indicated a financial reduction in total electricity revenue of 0.6-2.4% depending on the approach followed. A fixed monthly charge of about R363 would counter these potential financial loses, but entail a disincentive for households to invest in solar PV installations.","Distributed generation; Electricity utility revenue; Embedded energy; Photovoltaic; Renewable energy",,"Brent, A.C.; Department of Industrial Engineering, Centre for Renewable and Sustainable Energy Studies, Stellenbosch University, Private Bag X1, South Africa; email: acb@sun.ac.za",,"University of Cape Town",1021447X,,JESAE,,"English","J.

While models of technology diffusion are well established in literature, the spatial patterns of household adoption remain understudied. The present paper contributes to this emerging stream of literature by providing a comprehensive analysis of factors governing regional differences in residential PV adoption rates across Germany. The analysis focuses on economic factors, socio-demographic and attitudinal adopter characteristics, and settlement structure. A key characteristic of this paper is its measurement of regional spillover effects between neighboring counties, which might contribute to the geographic clustering of PV systems. The empirical analysis is based on aggregate panel data for 807,969 residential photovoltaic systems across 402 German counties for the time period 2000–2013. The analysis is performed by estimating a diffusion equation using a spatial autoregressive and a spatial error panel model. Results indicate that differences in economic incentives influence the spatial and temporal patterns of PV adoption. Further, socioeconomic status is found to have an impact on PV adoption, but the effect of environmental attitude and settlement structure is ambiguous. Significant spatial spillover effects are found between neighboring counties. These findings imply that there is potential for new policies and business models to increase the geographic and social diversification of PV adoption patterns. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Energy policy; Households; Regional distribution; Spatial panel models",,"Dharshing, S.; University of St. Gallen, St. GallenSwitzerland; email: samdruk.dharshing@unisg.ch",,"Elsevier Ltd",22146296,,,,"English","Energy Res.

The optimisation method obtains the techno-economic benefits of CES systems as a function of the size of the community ranging from a single home to a 100-home community in two different scenarios for the United Kingdom: the year 2020 and a hypothetical zero emissions target. It is demonstrated that the levelised cost and levelised value of CES systems reach intermediate values to those achieved when both applications are performed independently.

As a result, the capacity of solar photovoltaics (PVs) has increased significantly and has reached 1902 MW. Nevertheless, the installation of PVs on rooftops in the residential sector accounts for only a minute percentage (0.003%) of the total capacity of installed PVs. In this paper, a feasibility analysis of grid-connected solar PV rooftops for households under the present feed-in tariff framework was performed. The results demonstrate that the current feed-in tariff is not sufficient to promote investment in PV rooftops in the residential sector under the current market situation. Moreover, in order to support the current framework, additional supportive measures including (1) an appropriate feed-in-tariff rate, (2) personal income tax exemptions, (3) carbon trading, and (4) low interest rate loans, were proposed, and their effects were evaluated. The low interest rate loan appears to be the best measure for promoting and stimulating investment in residential-scale PV rooftops without additional subsidy.

In this paper a new photovoltaic solar concentrator model based on non-imaging optics and embedding high efficiency multi-junctions cells is presented. The concentrator has been optimized to maximize the electricity production but it is thought to work in cogeneration to allow also for thermal energy by recovering the residual heat, since an active cooling system for the cells is necessary. The efficiency enhancement is obtained thanks to the high matching between the collected solar irradiance and the receiver electrical features. The aim of the paper is the definition of the number of residential utilities connected to the system in order to minimize the exchange of energy with the network and also the use of auxiliary boiler. Also the optimal size of electric and thermal storage to be integrated to the concentrator, has been determined as function of the number of utilities. To achieve these goals a parametric analysis has been carried out by the use of an in-house-developed calculation code considering a whole year of operation in order to estimate the energy fluxes and the economic performance. Furthermore, the maximum capital cost of the system has been estimated in order to achieve a return on the investment in ten or twenty years.

Existing power systems of such remote towns in Australia have adverse environmental impacts and contribute to global warming due to the utilization of fossil fuels, especially diesel and gas. The possible electricity supply systems for such towns can vary from a diesel/gas generator towards a hybrid system composed of a generator, wind turbine, photovoltaic system, and battery energy storage. In order to limit the cost of the system and to propose the most economically feasible solution, various combinations of supply systems are considered. These systems are analyzed in this paper by the help of HOMER software to determine the optimal architecture and the control strategy of the supply system. This study has used real demand data of the town, as well as the prices of different electrical components in the Australian market. The scenario which yields the minimum cost of energy is defined and suggested. Also, a decision-making based technique is proposed to help the local electricity utility in finding the suitable solution in the case of budget limits on the investment and annual operation and maintenance.

This system is easy to implement by employing cheap electrical switches, off-the-shelf chargers and inverters. Control system models combining both power dispatching level and home appliance scheduling level are proposed to minimize the residents' energy cost and energy consumption from the grid with the practical constraints strictly satisfied. In addition, the resident comfort inconvenience level is considered in the control system models. The trade-off among operating cost, energy consumption and inconvenience is considered and a multi-objective optimization problem is formulated. The optimal control strategies are derived by solving a mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem. Simulation results show that the energy cost and energy consumption from the grid can be largely reduced with the proposed strategies. These results are important for customers to dispel their major uncertainty in determining whether to newly install or update to such photovoltaic-battery hybrid power systems. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Demand side management; Hybrid power system; Optimal control; Solar energy","Control systems; Costs; Demand side management; Domestic appliances; Economic and social effects; Electric load dispatching; Electric utilities; Energy utilization; Integer programming; Multiobjective optimization; Nonlinear programming; Power management; Secondary batteries; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Appliance scheduling; Control system models; Hybrid power systems; Mixed integer non-linear programming problems; Multi-objective optimization problem; Optimal control strategy; Optimal controls; Power management systems; Electric power system control; control system; cost analysis; demand-side management; economic analysis; electricity; energy efficiency; environmental assessment; household energy; multiobjective programming; nonlinearity; optimization; photovoltaic system; solar power","Yang, F.; Department of Automation, School of Power and Mechanical Engineering, Wuhan UniversityChina; email: f.yang@whu.edu.cn",,"Elsevier Ltd",09601481,,,,"English","Renew.

Previous work in this area has focused on the technical and economic aspects of energy autonomy at distinct scales, from individual buildings, through neighborhoods to districts. This paper employs a mixed integer linear program (MILP) to assess the effects of aggregation across these scales on the economics of energy autonomy in residential buildings. The model minimizes total energy system costs over the lifetime of the energy system, including micro-combined heat and power (mCHP), photovoltaic (PV), thermal and electrical storage, and boilers, at five distinct scales and for nine demand cases. It is subject to several constraints, among other things the degree of electrical self-sufficiency. The results indicate a shift in the economically optimal level of electrical self-sufficiency with scale, which in Single-Family Houses (SFHs) means from around 30% at the individual building level to almost 100% in districts of 1000 SFH households. Above around 560 households it could be economically advantageous to make a district of residential buildings electrically self-sufficient. In addition, a marginal increase in electrical self-sufficiency is significantly more expensive at lower aggregation scales (i.e. single buildings) compared to the scale of neighborhoods and districts. The level of interaction with the electrical distribution network increases with increasing electrical self-sufficiency before then decreasing at very high (above 70%) levels. Future work should focus on a richer socioeconomic differentiation, considering other sectors and technologies, incorporating demand side options and analyzing the effects on the overarching energy system. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Energy autonomy; Energy system modeling; Load profiles; Residential buildings; Scale effects","Economics; Electric power generation; Heating; Housing; Integer programming; Energy autonomies; Energy system model; Load profiles; Residential building; Scale effects; Buildings; autonomy; combined heat and power; electricity supply; household energy; incentive; numerical model; photovoltaic system; residential energy; scale effect; self sufficiency; thermal power","McKenna, R.; IIP, Building 06.33, Hertzstr. 16, Germany; email: mckenna@kit.edu",,"Elsevier Ltd",03062619,,APEND,,"English","Appl.

Spain, whilst among the EU countries with highest solar irradiation, has recently passed one of the most restrictive self-consumption regulations. We study the implications of this regulation in comparison with alternatives (net metering, net billing) on the profitability (internal rate of return) of potential residential, commercial and industrial investors, as well as the impact of PV self-consumption on government revenues and the electricity system. We find that this regulation hinders the diffusion of PV self-consumption applications by making them economically infeasible. It also creates inefficient disincentives for demand-side adjustment and by fostering disconnection from the grid. Under the current conditions, the direct economic impact of PV self-consumption on both aggregate government and electricity system revenues is positive for investments in the residential segment, negligible for those of the commercial segment and negative for those of the industrial segment. In order to raise compliance with the relevant European Commission guidelines and to promote the diffusion of PV systems at minimum cost to the electricity system, a dynamic net billing scheme is recommended. © 2017 The Authors","Internal rate of return; Net billing; Net metering; RD 900/2015; Renewable electricity; Windfall profit","Earnings; Housing; Investments; Internal rate of return; Net billing; Net metering; RD 900/2015; Renewable electricity; Profitability; alternative energy; compliance; economic impact; electricity supply; energy policy; European Commission; photovoltaic system; profitability; renewable resource; Spain","López Prol, J.; Wegener Center for Climate and Global Change, University of Graz, Brandhofgasse 5, Austria; email: javier.lopez-prol@uni-graz.at",,"Elsevier Ltd",03014215,,ENPYA,,"English","Energy Policy",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85021454874

Given the potential for solar photovoltaic energy to contribute to the energy mix in some countries, it is timely to carefully consider the potential environmental costs of operation of photovoltaic farms, which are experienced by the local population, while the general benefits accrue to all. We apply the contingent valuation method to a sample of local residents close to three selected photovoltaic farms in Portugal. Also, we design a discrete choice experiment to elicit the valuation of specific adverse impacts of electricity generation through photovoltaic energy by national residents. Our results show that the value elicited in the vicinity of the photovoltaic farms is non-negligible. On the other hand, national residents ponder the trade-offs implied by the choice sets and value positively the different adverse local impacts. Both of these estimates, in conjunction or independently, can be used to fully account for this often neglected cost of solar energy. Furthermore, we argue that when studying the public acceptance of renewables, using stated preference methods explicitly presents the trade-offs between negative impacts and costs, contributing to more realistic portrayal of public opinion. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Contingent valuation; Discrete choice experiments; Environmental impacts; Photovoltaic farms; Stated preference methods","Commerce; Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Economic and social effects; Electric power generation; Renewable energy resources; Social aspects; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Contingent valuation methods; Contingent valuations; Discrete choice experiments; Electricity generation; Photovoltaic; Renewable energy source; Solar photovoltaic energies; Stated preference method; Environmental impact; contingent valuation; discrete choice analysis; electricity generation; environmental impact; operations technology; photovoltaic system; renewable resource; solar power; Portugal","Valente, M.; EEG and NIMA, University of MinhoPortugal; email: mvalente@eeg.uminho.pt",,"Elsevier Ltd",03014215,,ENPYA,,"English","Energy Policy",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85030534282

Its economic potentials are compared to an on-grid system of PV-wind turbine to feed the same load while observing the effect of the implemented feed-in policy. The technical analysis shows that a 20 kW PV system and a 10 kW wind turbine can sufficiently supply the demand.

High Costs of operation; Energy dependence; fuel supply problem (removal of fuel suppliers); complicated and expensive maintenance; Low lifetime (about 5 years and sometimes less); Impossibility of 24 hours electricity production (or need for several GE; Sound Births and waste oil management issues). Furthermore, the continuous decline in the prices of generators based on renewable energy and the increasing reliability of these systems lead to a greater use of renewable energy sources for power generation in remote areas. A property which limits the use of renewable energy is related to the variability of resources. Fluctuations in load according to annual or daily periods are not necessarily correlated to the resources. In remote areas, the preferred option is the coupling between multiple sources, such as wind turbines and solar panels, this coupling is called hybrid power system. Algeria’s geographic location presents several advantages for the development and use of renewable energy, namely, solar energy and wind energy. In addition, Algeria has huge deposits of natural gas, 98% electricity comes from gas. Therefore, currently, the production of electricity from renewable energies primarily depends on their competitiveness with economic gas.The objective of this work is to study the technological feasibility and economic viability of the hybrid system (PV/fuel)electrification project in a school located in Tarat (Algeria) and to reduce traditional power emissions by using renewable energy.

However, due to the low renewable feed-in tariffs in many countries, microgrid users are generally not motivated to install expensive battery systems if they can only be used to satisfy the objective of grid operator. From this perspective, a microgrid power market that encourages users to install batteries for energy-trading will be helpful for the deployment of batteries. For such circumstances, this paper introduces a user-driven microgrid power market. The possible pricing schemes are discussed and an illustrative price controller is presented. The potential destabilizing effect of the collective trading behavior of users is analyzed. A novel dissipativity based distributed economic model prediction control approach is proposed to allow microgrid users to optimize their own benefits while ensuring the performance and stability of the residential microgrid.

This system is intended for autonomous dwellings far from conventional electricity networks. The model used in this study is based on a technique for the analysis and evaluation of these two energy sources, electrochemical storage and charging for a residential residence. This model is introduced into a simulation and calculation program using simple iterations to evaluate the configuration results of optimized systems and select from the results obtained an electrical power generation system coupled or separated from the two energy sources. These two sources being able to ensure a continuous energy balance in relation to the load of the residence that can be used at any time. These two sources are able to ensure a continuous energy balance in relation to the load of the residence that can be used at any time of the day and are the most economical of the systems found. The wind system adopted in the study is of the low start-up speed type for low wind regions similar to the selected region under study, despite the good solar resource present at this site, which will lead to an examination of its feasibility and profitability in covering the inactivity of photovoltaic panels in periods of no sunlight, i.e. a system with a reduced number of photovoltaic panels and storage batteries, the latter having to restore a full day of autonomy. Two configurations were selected and discussed. The first is composed of photovoltaic panels and storage batteries and the other includes the introduction of a wind power system in combination with the storage photovoltaic system resulting in a higher investment cost than the first. Consequently, the results obtained in this study prove that it is preferable to opt for a purely photovoltaic system with storage in this type of site and exclude the interest of adding micro wind turbines adapted for sites with low wind resources. © 2017 Lavoisier.","Hybrid photovoltaic-wind-storage system; Optimization; Photovoltaic system; Sizing; Wind system","Continuous time systems; Electric power supplies to apparatus; Energy balance; Housing; Investments; Optimization; Photovoltaic cells; Secondary batteries; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Wind power; Analysis and evaluation; Electrical power generation; Photovoltaic systems; Renewable energy source; Simulation and calculations; Sizing; Storage systems; Wind systems; Battery storage","Hajdidj, M.S.; Laboratoire d'U.r.m.e.r Unité de Recherche Matériaux et Energie Renouvelables, Université d'Abou Bakr Belkaid, BP 119-13000, Algeria; email: urmer13@mail.univ-tlemcen.dz",,"International Information and Engineering Technology Association",21033641,,,,"English","Euro.

However, technological advances and price declines mean that these TVs can now provide the same level of electricity service as standard LED-LCD TVs offer but at lower total energy cost. Moreover, LED-LCD TVs are inherently direct-current (DC)-powered devices and therefore well suited for use with off-grid solar home systems. We estimate that DC-powered energy-efficient LED-LCD TVs can decrease the retail purchase price of solar home systems by about 25% by allowing use of 50% smaller photovoltaics and battery capacities than would be needed for the same energy system to power a standard LED-LCD TV. We recommend that policies such as awards, bulk procurement, incentives, and energy labels be considered to facilitate the adoption of these energy-efficient TVs in off-grid settings. © 2017","Cost-benefit analysis; DC television; Electricity access; Off-grid electricity service; TV energy efficiency",,"Park, W.Y.; Energy Analysis and Environmental Impacts Division, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, One Cyclotron Road, MS 90R2121, United States; email: WYPark@lbl.gov",,"Elsevier Ltd",23527285,,,,"English","Dev.

One of the main problems with several renewable energy sources is their variability, which can be solved with energy storage. With buildings representing an important share of energy consumption, and given the growing capacity of distributed generation, distributed energy storage in buildings is expected to become increasingly present. In this context, the optimal dimensioning of home installations of photovoltaics and lithium-ion batteries, and the impact of such installations on the grid, is of the utmost importance. While there have been developments on this field, some important handicaps remain, notably the independent treatment of installation optimisation and grid impact and the substantial result differences between studies. In this paper, photovoltaics and lithium-ion storage installations are optimised through the use of real, high-resolution data from several individual households, based on realistic cost figures, and through well-defined metrics that correctly grasp the problem at hand. The impact on the grid as well as possible mitigation measures are also analysed. Results show that up to about 30% of electricity self-sufficiency can be obtained using only PV and close to grid parity. Above 40% self-sufficiency, energy storage must be used, strongly increasing the cost of such installations. Economies of scale play an important role suggesting a preferential implementation for larger users or at a community-scale. Feed-in limits seem to be a good solution to attenuate grid impact. On the other hand, a higher share of a capacity-based component on the grid tariff strongly affects the economic viability of such installations for the average household. These results are important for studies on distributed photovoltaics and energy storage as well as for energy policy. Also, the large range of results made available, calculated on a free market perspective using a simple control mechanism, provide a much-needed benchmark for further comparable studies. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Distributed energy storage; Home energy storage system; Levelised Cost Of Energy (LCOE); Lithium-ion battery energy storage; Photovoltaics (PV); Self-sufficiency","Costs; Digital storage; Economics; Electric energy storage; Energy utilization; Fossil fuels; Ions; Natural resources; Renewable energy resources; Distributed energy storages; Energy storage systems; Levelised cost of energies; Lithium ions; Photovoltaics; Self-sufficiency; Lithium-ion batteries; electricity generation; energy conservation; energy policy; lithium; photovoltaic system; renewable resource; self sufficiency; smart grid; Belgium",,,"Elsevier Ltd",03062619,,APEND,,"English","Appl.

In spite of many studies in the case of demand response programming for optimal management and operation cost reduction of the micro-grids, and regarding the importance of size optimization of micro-grids, this paper seeks to examine and investigate the ability of demand response programming in the case of component size optimization of a micro-grid. Due to deficiency or unavailability of dispatchable energy recourses, only the nondispatchable renewable energy resources (wind and solar energy) are considered to supply the required energy. Applied strategy for effective component size optimization as well as relevant costs reduction is implemented by reducing or eliminating the mismatch between the generation and consumption profiles by time shift and schedule of dispatchable loads. Furthermore, the effect of demand response utilization on loss of generated energy reduction is studied. The optimized results with and without demand response are extracted and compared to each other. For each case, the optimum configuration was determined. Obtained results indicated that application of the demand response program, reduced the number of required batteries, the required inverter and photovoltaic cells capacity, and, consequently, the total net present costs. Furthermore, demand response implementation reduced the peak of consumed loads and increased the consumed load factor and correlation factor. The micro-grid components have been modeled mathematically within the framework of the mixed integer linear programming method.

This makes it possible to observe which socioeconomic groups are benefitting most and least under the policy. Comparing the observed benefit distribution to a counterfactual distribution of perfect equality, a moderate to high level of inequality is found.

Tailored to be suitable for the diverse range of existing buildings in terms of age, size, and use, it combines dynamic energy demand simulation to explore individual retrofit scenarios with an energy hub optimisation. Implemented as an epsilon-constrained mixed integer linear program (MILP), the optimisation matches envelope retrofit with renewable and high efficiency energy supply technologies such as biomass boilers, heat pumps, photovoltaic and solar thermal panels to minimise life cycle cost and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Due to its multi-objective, integrated assessment of building transformation options and its ability to capture both individual building characteristics and trends within a neighbourhood, this method is aimed to provide developers, neighbourhood and town policy makers with the necessary information to make adequate decisions. Our method is deployed in a case study of typical residential buildings in the Swiss village of Zernez, simulating energy demands in EnergyPlus and solving the optimisation problem with CPLEX. Although common trade-offs in energy system and retrofit choice can be observed, optimisation results suggest that the diversity in building age and size leads to optimal strategies for retrofitting and building system solutions, which are specific to different categories.

In this regard, this study aimed to investigate the economic impact of RPETs in implementing the building-integrated photovoltaic blind (BIPB) using an advanced finite element model. First, the nine-node-based finite element model with improved prediction accuracy for estimating the technical performance of the BIPB (FEM9-node BIPB) was developed. Second, the life cycle cost approach was used to evaluate the effect of RPETs on the economic viability of the BIPB in terms of the energy demand and supply. The main findings of this study can be summarized as follows. First, the prediction accuracy of the developed FEM9-node BIPB was proved to be superior to the existing model, in which the estimation results can be found within a short time in an easy way. Second, considering the RPETs, it showed a tendency that the higher the amount of electricity consumption in a household was, the more improved the economic viability of the BIPB became. However, it should be also analyzed which tariff zones in the RPETs can be covered by the amount of electricity generated from the BIPB, because it can significantly affect the economic viability of the BIPB. Third, after the revision of the RPETs, the economic viability of the BIPB under the grid-connected utilization plan was determined to be superior.

The reliability of autonomous Photovoltaic water pumping plants depends essentially on the system components size, which should meet the criteria related to the plant autonomy and the water volume required for irrigation. In this context, this research paper proposes an approach to size the elements of an autonomous photovoltaic system equipped with an energy storage device (a battery bank), and which is used to supply a water-pumping plant with electricity. The proposed approach determines the optimal surface of the photovoltaic modules, the optimal capacity of the battery bank and the volume of the water storage tank. The optimization approach takes into account the monthly average solar radiation, the fulfillment of the water needed for the crops’ irrigation and the number of the days of autonomy. Measured climatic data of 10 ha situated in Northern Tunisia and planted with tomato are used in the optimization process, which is conducted during the tomato vegetative cycle (from March to July). The optimal results achieved for this farm are 101.5 m2of photovoltaic modules’ surface, 1680 A h/12 V of the battery bank and 1800 m3 of the volume of the water storage tank. Then, to verify the reliability of the proposed optimization approach, the results of the proposed sizing algorithm are compared with those of a commercial optimization tool named HOMER, which shows better results using the proposed approach. Finally, the economic reliability of the obtained size is studied and compared with systems that include a diesel generator, and a diesel generator- photovoltaic panels, respectively, using climatic and economic parameters in three countries: Tunisia, Spain and Jordan. The economic analysis for these water pumping systems showed that photovoltaic- batteries/Pump system is the optimum solution in the three countries. However, the initial cost of the system can be recuperated faster in Spain than in Tunisia and Jordan due to high prices of the diesel these two countries. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Economic sensitivity; Photovoltaic energy; System sizing; Water pumping","Digital storage; Electric batteries; Electric energy storage; Fruits; Irrigation; Photovoltaic cells; Pumping plants; Pumps; Reliability; Sensitivity analysis; Tanks (containers); Autonomous photovoltaic systems; Economic reliability; Optimization approach; Photovoltaic energy; Photovoltaic water pumping; System sizings; Water pumping; Water pumping systems; Economic analysis","Yahyaoui, I.; Technological Center, University of Espirìto SantoBrazil; email: imene.yahyaoui@ufes.br",,"Elsevier Ltd",01968904,,ECMAD,,"English","Energy Convers.

In the future, distribution network operators will have smart meter measurements available to them to facilitate safe and cost-effective operation of distribution networks. This paper investigates the application of smart meter measurements to extend the observability of distribution networks. An integrated load and state estimation algorithm was developed and tested using residential smart metering measurements and an 11 kV residential distribution network. Simulation results show that smart meter measurements, both real-time and pseudo measurements derived from them, can be used together with state estimation to extend the observability of a distribution network. The integrated load and state estimation algorithm was shown to produce accurate voltage magnitudes and angles at each busbar of the network. As a result, the algorithm can be used to enhance distribution network monitoring and control. © 2016","Cluster analysis; Load estimation; Smart meter measurements; State estimation","Carbon; Cluster analysis; Cost effectiveness; Housing; Observability; Photovoltaic cells; Smart meters; State estimation; Distribution network operators; Load estimation; Medium-voltage distribution networks; Network Monitoring; Pseudo measurements; Real time monitoring; State estimation algorithms; Voltage magnitude; Electric power distribution; algorithm; cluster analysis; control system; cost-benefit analysis; distribution system; electric vehicle; electronic equipment; estimation method; monitoring system; network analysis; photovoltaic system","Wu, J.; School of Engineering, Cardiff UniversityUnited Kingdom; email: wuj5@cardiff.ac.uk",,"Elsevier Ltd",03062619,,APEND,,"English","Appl.

Aim of the analysis is to assess the active and passive effects due to the building integration of solar technologies on the building energy consumptions. In particular, a comparison among innovative building-plant system configurations, based on BIPVT collectors for the simultaneous production of electricity, thermal energy, and domestic hot water, is carried out. The simulation models of the proposed system layouts are designed and implemented in TRNSYS simulation environment for the dynamic assessment of their energy and economic performance. By means of the developed simulation model, the occurring summer and winter building passive energy effects due to the PVT building integration are also analysed. Several case studies are developed by modelling a representative multi-storey residential building and by taking into account different European climates. For such case studies a suitable energy parametric analysis is performed by varying the thermal resistances and capacitances of the building envelope. By the simulation results interesting design and economic feasibility guidelines are obtained. In particular, by varying the weather location and the building-plant configuration, the adoption of BIPVT panels produces a decrease of the primary energy demands from 67% to 89%. The passive effects of the BIPVT system in both the winter and summer season are also assessed for all the investigated climate zones. The calculated economic profitability resulted slightly better for roof BIPVT panels than for roof and façade applications.

But, due to the recent globalization epoch, the rural and remote areas in the world are merging into urban communities and creating huge burden on the utility grid. Hence, the microgrids design focus has been shifting towards urban communities. Hybrid power systems are becoming a popular way in the design of microgrids by using locally available renewable energy sources (RES). This compensates the global depletion of conventional fossil fuel based utility grid energy. At this point of time, it is very important to examine the adoptability of those recent evolutions for a specific user location. With this intent, this paper presents various prospects in terms of challenges, opportunities, and techno-economic feasibility analysis for the integration of various RES to an existing urban building power system. The analysis is done by considering practical data of an enterprise building located in India. Various RES such as, photovoltaics, parabolic troughs, and wind energy are considered to form the microgrid. The simulation results increase the faith on the designed architecture by projecting an average cost savings of 27.55 %/day on the energy utilization with 5.97 years of return on investment.

Although thin films have lost market share in recent years, they have nonetheless grown at a robust rate of 24% between 2004 and 2014. Advantages such as lower cost per watt, ease of manufacturing, lower materials consumption among others continue to interest installers and developers. In this paper, we use performance and financial data from two 4 kWp thin film technologies – Amorphous Silicon (a-Si) and Copper Indium disulfide (CIS) – installed at the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology Kumasi Ghana to conduct a comparative techno-economic analysis. The cost and performance of a-Si results in a LCOE of €0.28/kWh compared with €0.41/kWh obtained for CIS. At installed cost of €3601.95/kW and €3576.25/kW for a-Si and CIS respectively, both technologies, however, do not compare favourably with existing tariffs on grid-based electricity for the non-residential sector – which pays the highest tariffs.

In developed solar markets, as many European countries, the sector is pushed by the alignment between the electric power demanded and the one offered. Consequently, self-consumption makes consumers active players of the energy transition. Italy is evaluated as a case study in this paper, in fact is the first country in the world where solar energy contributes largely to the national energetic demand. This paper aims to evaluate photovoltaic systems in residential sector without subsidies. Economic and environmental results are proposed and the indicators used are Net Present Value, Discounted Payback Time and Reduction in the Emissions of Carbon Dioxide. Three sizes (3 kW, 6 kW and 20 kW) are evaluated. In addition, a sensitivity analysis of critical variables (investment cost, annual electricity purchase price, annual electricity sales price, opportunity cost, tax deduction unitary, period of fiscal deduction, average annual insolation and percentage of energy self-consumption) demonstrates the robustness of the economic results. Also for environmental evaluation, alternative scenarios are proposed varying the value of emissions released by source energy analysed (photovoltaic, coal, oil and gas). Economic and environmental results suggest that small-scale photovoltaic systems can support the transition towards a sustainable energy mix. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Economic analysis; Environmental analysis; Photovoltaic; Residential sector","Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Commerce; Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Depreciation; Gas emissions; Housing; Investments; Photovoltaic cells; Power markets; Sensitivity analysis; Solar energy; Taxation; Energy transitions; Environmental analysis; Environmental evaluation; Photovoltaic; Photovoltaic power plant; Photovoltaic systems; Profitability assessments; Residential sectors; Economic analysis","Cucchiella, F.; Department of Industrial and Information Engineering and Economics, University of L'Aquila, Via G.

The main objectives of this study are to examine which configuration is the most cost-effective for the village. One renewable energy model has been developed for supplying electric power for 124 rural households of an off-grid rural village in eastern India. The load demand of the village was determined by the survey work, and the loads were divided into three sub-heads such as primary load I, primary load II and deferred load. Locally available energy sources such as solar radiation and biogas derived from cow dung and kitchen wastes were used as sensitivity variables. This study is unique as it has not considered any diesel generator for supplying unmet electricity to the households; rather it completely depends on locally available renewable resources. Here in this paper, two different models were taken and their cost and environmental benefit were discussed and compared. The net present cost, levelised cost of energy and operating cost for various configurations of models were determined. The minimum cost of energy of $0.476/kWh with lowest net present cost of $386,971 and lowest operating cost ($21,025/year) was found with stand-alone solar–biogas hybrid system. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","HOMER; Hybrid; Insolation; Optimisation; Photovoltaics","cost-benefit analysis; demand analysis; electricity supply; household energy; optimization; photovoltaic system; power generation; renewable resource; rural area; sustainable development; India","Goel, S.; Department of Electrical Engineering, Institute of Technical Education and Research, Siksha ‘O’ Anusandhan UniversityIndia; email: sonali19881@gmail.com",,"Springer Netherlands",1387585X,,EDSNB,,"English","Environ.

It is revealed that LED and CFL through solar photovoltaic and electricity should be the best choice of domestic lighting. Most of the households (97 %), even electrified, use kerosene regularly. There is a huge potential of biogas and solar photovoltaic which can overcome the problem of power cut, indoor pollution, carbon emission, etc. Supporting electrification to all households, this study is also justifying about efficient devices and off-grid power generation through SPV for all households and biogas for possible 2300 households.

Other developments, like in-home storage or peer-to-peer exchange within a neighbourhood, also contribute to the transition. This paper explores the emerging rise of these prosumers of electricity and its implications, in particular for grid management and electricity supply in the Netherlands. Methods: With the help of an agent-based model, we illustrate the evolution of prosumption in a small Dutch-oriented residential community in five scenarios. The second part of the paper discusses the implications of the modelled rise in prosumption. Results: Depending on the number of prosumers, combined with storage and peer-to-peer supply, we found a share of prosumption in this local community of about 28–30 %. The community will require less electricity from the central power plants. These model results also indicate that the management of the local network will become more important if more households become prosumers in combination with storage and peer-to-peer supply. Conclusions: These trends affect current business models of DSOs and electricity production and supply companies. The latter are facing a loss of turnover which needs to be compensated by developing alternative business models. And, DSOs have to deal with the new needs on the local grid which also require an adaptation of their business models. Developing business models in cooperation with local energy communities could be an attractive alternative to explore. © 2016, The Author(s).","Business models; DSO; Electricity production companies; Electricity supply companies; Peer-to-peer; Prosumption; Residential storage","Autonomous agents; Computational methods; Digital instruments; Electric power generation; Energy policy; Housing; Photovoltaic cells; Business models; Electricity production; Electricity supply; Peer to peer; Prosumption; Peer to peer networks; business; economic analysis; electricity generation; electricity supply; energy conservation; energy use; model test; photovoltaic system; renewable resource; residential energy; sustainability; Netherlands","Arentsen, M.; CSTM University of TwenteNetherlands; email: m.j.arentsen@utwente.nl",,"Springer Verlag",21920567,,,,"English","Energy Sustainability Soc.",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84983628375

Therefore, there is an urgent need to provide an optimal sustainable and environment-friendly energy system for the coastline communities in Nigeria, which has the potential of ameliorating the climate change in this country. Methods: The HOMER hybrid optimisation software and multi-criteria decision-making, based on the TOPSIS algorithm, were used to determine the best hybrid energy system. The decision is based on four alternatives as well as 15 different economic, social and environmental criteria. The NASA SEE data base with monthly averaged values for global horizontal radiation over a 22-year period (July 1983–June 2005) was considered in the current analysis. Results: The results show that the most promising hybrid energy system, based on a multi-criteria decision analysis and prevailing economic data, is the diesel-PV-wind energy system, which has a relative closeness of 0.489226. The suggested best hybrid energy system has a cost of electricity of 0.787 $/kWh and potential to reduce gas emission by 48.5 %/year. The best energy system gives the best components with an appropriate operating strategy to provide an efficient, reliable, cost-effective and environment-friendly system. It is shown that both positive energy policies of the Federal Government of Nigeria towards renewable energy penetration and the support from the oil producing companies towards their operational areas would see the cost of electricity being significantly reduced. Conclusions: It is envisaged that the implementation of the suggested energy system with other environmentally responsible interventions would support the Niger Delta coastline communities, whose livelihoods have been impaired by gas and oil exploration, to attain their full environmental, social and economic potentials. The suggested energy system could be useful in other coastline communities globally once there are available renewable energy sources. © 2016, The Author(s).","HOMER; Hybrid system; Renewable energy; TOPSIS","Climate change; Cost effectiveness; Cost reduction; Costs; Decision making; Hybrid systems; Landforms; NASA; Rural areas; Wind power; Environmentally responsible; HOMER; Hybrid renewable energy systems; Multi criteria decision making; Multi-criteria decision analysis; Renewable energies; Renewable energy penetrations; TOPSIS; Renewable energy resources; algorithm; climate change; coastal zone; decision making; diesel; environmental degradation; multicriteria analysis; nonrenewable resource; rural electrification; software; sustainability; wind power; Niger Delta; Nigeria","Diemuodeke, E.O.; The Energy Centre, College of Engineering, Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and TechnologyGhana; email: ogheneruona.diemuodeke@uniport.edu.ng",,"Springer Verlag",21920567,,,,"English","Energy Sustainability Soc.",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84987835365

Many observers have predicted an uptake of combined PV/battery units which could ultimately disconnect from the grid and lead to autonomous homes or micro-grids. However, most of the comments in social media, blogs or press articles lack proper cost evaluation and realistic simulations. We aim to bridge this gap by simulating self-consumption in various EU countries, for various household profiles, with or without battery. Results indicate that (1) self-consumption is a non-linear, almost asymptotic function of PV and battery sizes. Achieving 100% self-consumption (i.e. allowing for full off-grid operation) is not realistic for the studied countries without excessively oversizing the PV system and/or the battery; (2) although falling fast, the cost of domestic Li-Ion storage is most likely still too high for a large-scale market uptake in Europe; (3) home battery profitability and future uptake depend mainly on the indirect subsidies for self-consumption provided by the structure of retail prices; (4) the self-sufficiency rate varies widely between households. For a given household, the volume of self-consumption cannot be predicted in a deterministic way. Along with these results, this study also provides a database of synthetic household profiles, a simulation tool for the prediction of self-consumption and a method for the optimal sizing of such systems. © 2016 The Author(s)","Battery; Electricity; Household; Prosumer; PV; Retail; Self-consumption","Costs; Electric batteries; Electricity; Social networking (online); Solar energy; Battery; Household; Prosumer; Retail; Self-consumption; Lithium-ion batteries; catalyst; database; economic analysis; European Union; prediction; profitability; self sufficiency; social media; solar power; statistical analysis; Europe","Quoilin, S.; European Commission, DG Joint Research Center, Institute for Energy and Transport, P.O.

However, the mismatch between the demand and the photovoltaic generation profiles leads to high power flows between the household and the grid. The appearance of tariffs that foster the self-consumption and penalize the injection of energy into the electrical grid increases the need to provide cost-effective solutions to enable the matching between electric generation and consumption. Used EV batteries are unsuitable for vehicles, but can be used in secondary applications, such as residential PV energy storage.

Shadows on a solar panel can be caused by nearby tall buildings, construction materials such as water tanks, or the roof configuration itself. The azimuth angle of the sun varies, based on the season and the time of day. Therefore, the simulation of shadow for one or two days or using the rule of thumb may not be sufficient to evaluate shadow effects on solar panels throughout the year. In this paper, a methodology for estimating the solar potential of solar PV on rooftops is presented, which is particularly applicable to urban areas. The objective of this method is to assess how roof type and shadow play a role in potentiality and financial benefit. The method starts with roof type extraction from high-resolution satellite imagery, using Object Base Image Analysis (OBIA), the generation of a 3D structure from height data and roof type, the simulation of shadow throughout the year, and the identification of potential and financial prospects. Based on the results obtained, the system seems to be adequate for calculating the financial benefits of solar PV to a very fine scale. The payback period varied from 7-13 years depending on the roof type, direction, and shadow impact. Based on the potentiality, a homeowner can make a profit of up to 200%. This method could help homeowners to identify potential roof area and economic interest. © 2016 by the authors.","3D map; OBIA; Potential area; Shadow map; Solar PV","azimuth; building; finance; homeowner; image analysis; installation; map; photovoltaic system; roof; satellite imagery; site selection; solar power; surface area; urban area","Ninsawat, S.; Remote Sensing and Geographic Information Systems (RS and GIS) FoS, Asian Institute of Technology (AIT), P.O.

This study examines the combined effect of electric rate structures and local environmental forcings on optimal solar home system size, ratepayer financials, utility financials, and electric grid ramp rate requirements for three urban regions in the United States. Techno-economic analyses are completed for Chicago, Phoenix, and Seattle and the results contrasted to provide both generalizable findings and site-specific findings. Various net metering scenarios and time-of-use rate schedules are investigated to evaluate the optimal solar PV capacity and battery storage in a typical residential home for each locality. The net residential load profile is created for a single home using BEopt and then scaled to assess technical and economic impacts to the utility for a market segment of 10,000 homes modeled in HOMER. Emphasis is given to intraday load profiles, ramp rate requirements, peak capacity requirements, load factor, revenue loss, and revenue recuperation as a function of the number of ratepayers with solar PV. Increases in solar PV penetration reduced the annual system load factor by an equivalent percentage yet had little to no impact on peak power requirements. Ramp rate requirements were largest for Chicago in October, Phoenix in July, and Seattle in January. Net metering on a monthly or annual basis had a negligible impact on optimal solar PV capacity, yet optimal solar PV capacity reduced by 20–50% if net metering was removed altogether. Technical and economic data are generated from simulations with solar penetration up to 100% of homes. For the scenario with 20% homes using solar PV, the utility would need a 16%, 24%, and 8% increase in time-of-use electricity rates ($/kW h) across all ratepayers to recover lost revenue in Chicago, Phoenix, and Seattle, respectively. The $15 monthly connection fee would need to increase by 94%, 228%, or 50% across the same cities if time-of-use electricity rates were to remain unchanged. Batteries were found to be cost-effective in simulations without net metering and at cost reductions of at least 55%. Batteries were not cost-effective—even if they were free—when net metering was in effect. As expected, Phoenix had the most favorable economic scenario for residential solar PV, primarily due to the high solar insolation. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Electricity rates; Energy economics; Net metering; Residential solar; Solar photovoltaic (PV); Techno-economic optimization","Commerce; Cost effectiveness; Cost reduction; Costs; Digital storage; Economic analysis; Economics; Electric batteries; Housing; Solar concentrators; Energy economics; Net metering; Residential solar; Solar photovoltaics; Techno-economics; Solar power generation; economics; electricity supply; energy market; energy planning; optimization; photovoltaic system; price dynamics; renewable resource; residential energy; solar power; Arizona; Chicago; Illinois; Phoenix; Seattle; United States; Washington [United States]","Johnson, N.G.; The Polytechnic School, Ira A.

In addition, besides the energy flows among the equipments within the hybrid energy system, the economic information including electricity tariff and natural gas price, as well as some policy issues (e.g., buy-back price) are also accounted. As the results of the model, besides the optimal electric and thermal balances, the rational utilization forms of PV module, fuel cell and battery can be also deduced. To verify the viability of the proposed approach, a numerical example is implemented and analyzed. The optimal operating strategies are deduced and compared from different perspectives.

These facts will probably limit the willingness to invest (WTI) in BIGCPs. This problem is referred as an Available Investment Area for BIGCP Installation (AIABI) problem. This paper worked out a way to estimate the restriction brought by the AIABI problem in a certain urban district by applying high definition remote sensing images and signal processing methods. A cased study is carried out in Beijing city, the result shows that there exists a least-acceptable-SPBP range in which a large proportion of the total AIABIs will not be invested in the case. This result explained the low adoption rate of BIGCP in residential buildings in urban discovered by literature.

It is based on the Modified Electric System Cascade Analysis method. The Power Pinch analysis is used as a guideline for development of an isolated power supply system, which consists of photovoltaic panels, wind turbines and energy storage units. The design procedure uses a simulation model, developed using MATLAB/SIMULINK and applies the developed algorithms for obtaining an optimal design. A validation of the Modified Electric System Cascade Analysis method is performed by comparing the obtained results with those from the Homer Pro software. The procedure takes as inputs hourly wind speed, solar radiation, demands, as well as cost data, for the generation and storage facilities. It is also applied to minimize the loss of power supply probability and to minimize the number of storage units. The algorithm has been demonstrated with a case study on a site in Oujda city, with daily electrical energy demand of 18.7 kWh, resulting in a combination of photovoltaic panels, wind turbine and batteries at minimal cost. The results from the Modified Electric System Cascade Analysis and HOMER Pro show that both tools successfully identified the optimal solution with difference of 0.04% in produced energy, 5.4% in potential excess of electricity and 0.07% in the cost of the energy. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Hybrid system; MESCA and Homer Pro; Pinch analysis; Standalone system","Costs; Digital storage; Electric energy storage; Electric power systems; Electric tools; Hybrid systems; MATLAB; Optimal systems; Photovoltaic cells; Wind; Wind turbines; Electrical energy demand; Electricity-generation system; Hybrid renewable energies; Isolated power supplies; Loss of power supply probability; MESCA and Homer Pro; Pinch analysis; Standalone systems; Cost benefit analysis","Zahboune, H.; Laboratory of Electrical Engineering and Maintenance – LEEM, University Mohammed 1st, High School of TechnologyMorocco; email: hassan.etat@gmail.com",,"Elsevier Ltd",01968904,,ECMAD,,"English","Energy Convers.

The investigation regards a real multi-storey apartment block, representative of a significant amount of edifices built in Italy in 1950–1990, which often need refurbishment because of obsolescence. This building type is generally well suited to receive a new double-skin façade, supporting both PV and other common cladding materials, while also representing a good compromise in terms of aesthetic quality, cost, weight, durability and ease of maintenance. In order to make general conclusions, a parametric analysis is performed, by virtually changing the orientation, the number of floors and the climatic conditions, and by considering different PV technologies. The results show that for an 8-storey building with the main axis along E-W, the initial investment can be repaid within around nine years, if considering the current fiscal incentives and a 50% self-consumption rate for the electricity produced by the PV modules. The presence of fiscal incentives is essential to make the investment attractive. Better PV efficiencies, lower prices and higher self-consumption rates can enhance the economic profitability, which may generate a significant impact on the retrofit of European multi-storey residential stock. These results can be effectively extended to the PV integration on the façades of new apartment blocks too. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","BIPV; Double-skin façade; Energy retrofit; Payback time; Temperate climate","Apartment houses; Buildings; Climatology; Housing; Obsolescence; Photovoltaic cells; Profitability; Retrofitting; BIPV; Double skin; Energy retrofit; Payback time; Temperate climate; Investments","Evola, G.; Dipartimento di Ingegneria Elettrica, Elettronica e Informatica, University of Catania, Viale A.

The feasibility, energy savings, and economics of such systems have been assessed and proven in data centers and commercial buildings, but the outcomes are still uncertain for the residential sector. In this work, we assess the technical and economic feasibility of DC circuits using data for 120 traditionally-wired AC homes in Austin, Texas to understand the effect of highly variable demand profiles on DC-powered residences, using appliance-level use and solar generation data, and performing a Monte Carlo simulation to quantify costs and benefits. Results show site energy savings between 9% and 20% when solar PV is distributed to all home appliances. When battery storage for excess solar energy is considered, these savings increase to 14–25%. At present DC equipment prices, converting all equipment to DC causes levelized annual costs of electricity to homeowners to roughly double. However, by converting only homes’ air conditioning condensing units to DC, the costs of direct-DC are greatly reduced and home site energy savings of 7–16% are generated. In addition to quantifying savings, we find major nontechnical barriers to implementing direct-DC in homes. These include a lack of standards for such systems, a relatively small market for DC appliances and components, utility programs designed for AC power, and a workforce unfamiliar with DC. Experience with DC is growing in other sectors, and with time this will be transitioned to a broader audience of engineers, electricians, and building inspectors to ensure that not only are the systems themselves safe, but that the image of direct current circuits becomes less foreign over time. Direct current may very well have a place in the residential sector, and research and development should continue to explore other potential benefits that might make a stronger case for a more widespread transition to what now appears a promising technology. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Direct current; Economics; Energy efficiency; Residential","Air conditioning; Buildings; Costs; Digital storage; Domestic appliances; Economics; Energy efficiency; Equipment; Housing; Intelligent systems; Monte Carlo methods; Office buildings; Reconfigurable hardware; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Commercial building; Direct current; Direct current circuits; Economic feasibilities; Non-technical barriers; Research and development; Residential; Residential sectors; Energy conservation; air conditioning; building; demand analysis; economics; electricity supply; energy conservation; energy efficiency; energy market; feasibility study; Monte Carlo analysis; research and development; residential energy; Austin; Texas; United States","Glasgo, B.; Engineering and Public Policy, Carnegie Mellon University, 129 Baker Hall, 5000 Forbes Ave., United States; email: bglasgo@andrew.cmu.edu",,"Elsevier Ltd",03062619,,APEND,,"English","Appl.

Vehicle to Home technologies use idle electric vehicle battery power as a grid storage tool to mitigate fluctuations from renewable electric power sources and to help supply backup power in the event of an emergency. This study aims to investigate the role of Vehicle to Home technology in satisfying the energy requirements for a net zero energy building. For this purpose, an optimization analysis is performed first to select the best design alternatives for an energy-efficient building under the relevant economic and environmental constraints. Next, solar photovoltaic sources are used to supply the building's remaining energy demand and thereby minimize the building's grid reliance. Finally, Vehicle to Home technology is coupled with the renewable energy source as a substitute for power from the grid.

This paper presents a coordinated hierarchical controls selection method for mitigating the overvoltage problem using available resources in DNs, for example, static synchronous compensators (STATCOM) and battery energy storage (BES) systems. The proposed method recommends the installation of new control devices, such as photovoltaic (PV) smart voltage source inverter (VSI) with reactive power compensation capability, residential BES installations, and power sharing among neighboring distributed generator (DG) units depending on PV penetration levels at the LV network. The requirements of the proposed installation of the compensation devices are based on three criteria: (i) higher PV penetration scenarios; (ii) satisfying relevant standards; and (iii) economic perspectives. The interactions among standard VSI (operated at unity power factor (pf)) and smart VSI (variable pf) are also considered in the proposed method to mitigate the voltage rise problems. The results show that only after exceeding certain PV penetrations, the LV network requires a coordinated operation from STATCOM/BES and advanced compensation devices to sustain terminal voltages within permissible (±6%) limits. The proposed method is verified with extensive case studies utilizing real PV irradiance and customer loads data with nonlinear dynamic DER models connected with an urban LV network in the PSCAD/EMTDC software environment.

For determining their optimal configurations, it is often challenging in obtaining accurate input data, particularly prospective electricity loads and local renewable resource availability. In this study, the configuration of the off-grid 120 kWp PV system in West Bengal, India is reassessed by using the optimization software, HOMER. With an assumption that excess biomass resources would be available as a result of successful introduction of fuel-saving devices such as solar cookers, a PV–biomass–battery system, which consists of 30 kW PV array and 20 kW biomass gasification-based power plant (BGPP), turns out to be the most economically feasible option. Compared with the actual system, the net present cost (NPC) and cost of electricity (COE) are significantly lowered. Furthermore, in order to verify effectiveness of “phased approach” for developing the off-grid renewable energy system, which has been proposed in the authors' previous study, the system expansion process is simulated by HOMER according to three different load growth scenarios. It is found from the simulation that adjustment of the system size becomes possible with more accurate load estimation at the time of expansion, which may lead to lower operation and maintenance (O&M) costs and COE. As a result of the increased level of tariff revenue from additional consumers, the expansion process would provide an opportunity for enhancing community welfare and financial viability of the project. © 2016 International Energy Initiative","Demand growth; HOMER; Integrated renewable energy system; Micro-grid; Optimization; System expansion","Biomass; Costs; Developing countries; Ecology; Expansion; Fuel economy; Optimization; Photovoltaic cells; Rural areas; Demand growth; HOMER; Integrated renewable energy systems; Micro grid; System expansion; Renewable energy resources; alternative energy; biomass power; computer simulation; decentralization; demand analysis; developing world; numerical model; optimization; power generation; renewable resource; rural electrification; India; West Bengal","Kobayakawa, T.; Japan International Cooperation Agency, 5-25 Niban-cho, Japan; email: kobayakawa.toru@gmail.com",,"Elsevier B.V.",09730826,,,,"English","Energy Sustainable Dev.",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84979917750

Besides, unpredictable fluctuation of diesel prices in electricity generation is affecting the economy of a country. Thus, for developing country that's economically leans on the use of energy, renewable energy resources should be utilized to meet the increasing energy demand. In this regards, the cogeneration system using renewable energy sources is appropriate, because it has the advantage of producing both electrical power and heat energy from a single fuel. It is suitable for commercial clients like hospital buildings which requires to supply both electric and heat load. Therefore, the aim of this study is to assess the viability to develop a cogeneration system for a hospital building load in Malaysia. The proposed cogeneration system consists of grid connected photovoltaic (PV), fuel cell, and battery. Hybrid optimization model for electric renewable (HOMER) simulation software is used to perform the techno-economic analysis of the proposed system. The proposed system is then compared with other possible configurations. The economical comparison is based on the total net present cost (TNPC), levelized cost of energy (LCOE), renewable fraction, excess energy production and the pollutant gas emission of the system. The simulation result shows that, the proposed cogeneration system has the lowest TNPC, LCOE and operating cost which are $ 106,551, 0.091 $/kWh and 7245 $/yr respectively. Besides, the proposed cogeneration system is proven environmentally friendly as it only produces total 25,873 kg/yr of pollutant gas.

The approach presented here adds novelty in terms of a realistic socioeconomic differentiation by employing dwelling/household archetypes (DHAs) and neighbourhood clusters at the Output Area (OA) level. These archetypes are combined with a mixed integer linear program (MILP) to generate optimum (minimum cost) technology configurations and operation schedules. Even in the baseline case, without any LCT penetration, a substantial deviation from the standard load profile (SLP) is encountered, suggesting that for some neighbourhoods this profile is not appropriate. With the application of LCTs, including heat pumps, micro-CHP and photovoltaic (PV), this effect is much stronger, including more negative residual load, more variability, and higher ramps with increased LCT penetration, and crucially different between neighbourhood clusters. The main policy implication of the study is the importance of understanding electrical load profiles at the neighbourhood level, because of the consequences they have for investment in the overarching energy system, including transmission and distribution infrastructure, and centralised generation plant.

IS.C4, Naples, Italy","In the paper, a model for the simulation and the optimization of a novel solar trigeneration system is presented. The plant simulation model is designed to supply electricity, space heating or cooling and domestic hot water for a small residential building. The system is based on a solar field equipped with flat-plate photovoltaic/thermal collectors, coupled with a water-to-water electric heat pump/chiller. The electrical energy produced by the hybrid collectors is entirely supplied to the building. During the winter, the thermal energy available from the solar field is used as a heat source for the evaporator of the heat pump and/or to produce domestic hot water. During the summer, the heat pump operates in cooling mode, coupled with a closed circuit cooling tower, providing space cooling for the building, and the hot water produced by the collectors is only used to produce domestic hot water. For such a system, a dynamic simulation model was developed in TRNSYS environment, paying special attention to the dynamic simulation of the building, too. The system was analyzed from an energy and economic point of view, considering different time bases. In order to minimize the pay-back period, an optimum set of the main design/control parameters was obtained by means of a sensitivity analysis. Simultaneously, a computer-based Design of Experiment procedure was implemented, aiming at calculating the optimal set of design parameters, using both energy and economic objective functions. The results showed that thermal and electrical efficiencies are above 40% and 10%, respectively. The coefficient of performance of the reversible heat pump resulted above 4 for both heating and cooling modes. For the base case, a Simple Pay Back period of 5.36 years was found; such index decreases to 2.33 years in case a capital investment incentive of 30% is available. As expected, a decrease of the performance of the system was detected for weather conditions in which the availability of solar energy is scarce. The Design of Experiments analysis outlined that the appropriate selection of collector area is crucial in order to achieve a good profitability of the system under analysis. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Cooling; Heat pump; Heating; Simulation; Solar","Availability; Computer aided design; Cooling; Design; Design of experiments; Heat pump systems; Heating; Hot water distribution systems; Investments; Pumps; Sensitivity analysis; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Thermography (temperature measurement); Water; Coefficient of Performance; Computer based designs; Economic objective function; Heat pumps; Simulation; Solar; Solar assisted heat pump; Thermoeconomic optimization; Structural design","Figaj, R.D.; Department of Engineering, University of Naples Parthenope, Centro Direzionale.

In Algeria, building sector is responsible of more than 40% of the final energy consumption. Solar energy systems integrated in buildings can be an important solution to this dual problem. The aim of this paper is to estimate the energy performance of a typical single-family bioclimatic house equipped with a solar heating system located in the north Algeria (Algiers) and to investigate its conversion into a zero energy house by installing a grid connected PV system. To achieve this goal, a numerical model of the bioclimatic house coupled with the solar heating system is developed and validated with experimental data. Then, the validated model is used to optimize the adequate size of the solar heating system and to determine its contribution in the production of thermal energy for both DHW preparation and space heating of the house. Finally, a PV system is sized to supply, in parallel with the utility grid, the house with electricity for lighting, appliance and auxiliary electric heater. Furthermore, an economic analysis is made to show the profitability of integration of grid connected PV and solar thermal systems in building. Results show that the conversion of a bioclimatic house into a ZEH using a grid connected PV system, in the north of Algeria weather conditions, present high level of feasibility. However, the return on investment is very high due mainly to the high cost of solar energy components and the very low costs of conventional energy in Algeria. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Bioclimatic house; HOMER software; Solar PV system; Solar thermal system; TRNSYS software; Zero energy house","Economic analysis; Energy conservation; Energy utilization; Heating equipment; Houses; Investments; Profitability; Solar energy; Solar heating; Thermography (temperature measurement); Greenhouse emissions; Grid connected PV system; Homer softwares; Solar energy systems; Solar heating system; Solar PV systems; Solar thermal systems; Zero energy house; Heating","Missoum, M.; Centre de Développement des Energies Renouvelables, CDER, BP 62, Route de l'Observatoire Bouzaréah, Algeria; email: missoum1976@hotmail.fr",,"Elsevier Ltd",03787788,,ENEBD,,"English","Energy Build.",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84978197337

This work conducts a techno-economic feasibility study of BAPV for commercial and residential building hybrid energy systems (HES). A component sizing model based on the optimal power dispatch simulations with the objective of minimum cost of energy (COE) is used to determine the component sizes of HES. The techno-economic performances of two HES composed of BAPV and batteries for residential and commercial buildings are investigated. The results show that the use of BAPV in the commercial building HES can reduce the electricity bill for customers owing to the government subsidies on PV as well as due to the similar characteristics of the load profile as to the solar radiation profile. However, due to temporal dislocation between the load and solar radiation patterns, the use of PV in the residential building HES may significantly increase the initial capital cost and replacement cost of battery, resulting in the COE of the residential building HES with BAPV even higher than the residential electricity price. The techno-economic performances of battery (e.g., the lifetime and capital cost) have more effect on the COE of the residential building HES than that of PV. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Building added photovoltaics; Component sizing; Hybrid energy systems; Techno-economic assessment","Buildings; Costs; Economic analysis; Electric batteries; Housing; Office buildings; Photovoltaic cells; Renewable energy resources; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Solar radiation; Component sizing; Hybrid energy system; Optimal power dispatch; Photovoltaics; Residential electricity; Solar photovoltaic power generations; Techno-economic assessment; Techno-economic feasibility; Electric load dispatching","Zhang, X.; MOE Key Laboratory of Thermo-Fluid Science and Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong UniversityChina; email: xwenz@mail.xjtu.edu.cn",,"Elsevier Ltd",13594311,,ATENF,,"English","Appl Therm Eng",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84982141368

Firstly, based on residential area, controllable load characteristics and thermodynamic theorems, a controllable load output model was established. Secondly, day-ahead dispatch able to get appropriate time-of-use (TOU) price was established to ensure profit maximization for operators after orderly charging of electric vehicle. Real-time dispatch was introduced to modify imbalance between power supply and demand due to recent prediction error. In real-time dispatch, electric vehicle charging scheme was optimized based on TOU price to achieve minimized real-time dispatch cost. Finally, through simulation verification on the proposed model and algorithm, results show that the proposed two-stage dispatch optimization approach can reduce intelligent community's cooperative dispatch cost.

Split incentives, where owners cannot benefit economically from energy cost savings for residences and resident investment in EERE is not feasible, have posed a significant barrier. A clean energy utility is posited to circumvent this barrier. This utility would be responsible for power purchase from the grid, ideally as a real-time purchase agent from the grid manager; investment in energy efficiency and renewable energy; and demand management through control of water heating, as well as supply-side management through deployment of stored solar at near-peak grid power purchase cost. A clean energy fee is posed for recovery of costs, in contrast to typical consumption strategies (per kW h). A case study approach is employed to evaluate the feasibility of this type of utility of reducing carbon production in this building sector. Considered in the analysis is a 2008 multifamily facility located in the Midwest of the U.S., with apartment level interval meters for both power and water. Historical data from these meters were used to assess the savings and demand-side management potential from investments in improved efficiency lighting, refrigeration, heat pumps, and water heaters, as well as investments in solar PV and storage for supply-side management. The results show that the packaged retrofit EERE investment could yield costs for residents and profits for energy manager comparable to those in the current residential pricing scheme, while reducing grid-sourced energy by 42%. When solar PV and battery storage are added to the solution, it is shown that a clean energy fee structure can cost-effectively drive savings to over 54%. For new construction, even deeper cost effective savings are realizable. This research demonstrates the potential to drive deep energy savings in the multifamily building sector that can lower costs to residents through the establishment of clean energy utilities which recover investments in energy efficiency, demand management, and solar PV/battery systems through resident clean energy fees rather than consumption fees. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Demand side management; Energy efficiency; Energy storage; Renewable energy","Carbon; Cost effectiveness; Costs; Demand side management; Deregulation; Digital storage; Economics; Electric power system control; Electric utilities; Energy conservation; Energy efficiency; Energy storage; Housing; Information management; Managers; Power markets; Sales; Storage management; Carbon production; Case study approach; Consumption strategy; Deregulated energy market; Energy cost savings; Multi-family housings; Renewable energies; Supply side managements; Investments","Raziei, A.; Dept. of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of DaytonUnited States; email: razieis1@udayton.edu",,"Elsevier Ltd",03787788,,ENEBD,,"English","Energy Build.",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84975833694

However, costs, lack of incentives for the systems, and the need for proof-of-concepts continue to limit market penetration. The surplus of natural gas in certain areas of the United States, particularly Texas, continues to keep gas and electricity production economical compared to solar alternatives. However, trends that demand lower energy homes, a desire for local energy independence, and the lowering of carbon dioxide emissions continue to fuel solar energy systems penetration. To support solar use, this research was performed to evaluate and analyze the real-world life cycle energy and costs of a solar photovoltaic and solar hot water system (SHWS) installed on a high-end residential home in Houston, TX (IECC Zone 2). The house was a well-insulated, large urban home with two renewable energy systems installed: a 3.5 kW solar photovoltaic system (SPVS) and a 1.71 kW solar hot water system. Analyses were part of a larger study performed to investigate the contributions of the solar energy offsets on the operational energy of the building over a life cycle period of 30-years. Field measurements of energy production were compared to solar energy simulations based on the typical meteorological year and the National Solar Radiation Database (NSRDB) data. NSRDB provided the basis for a probabilistic interpretation of annual energy production in terms of probability measures, P50/P90. It was found that field estimates were within simulation uncertainties and P90 predictions were within 2.5% of TMY3 (typical meteorological year data 3) results for both the solar photovoltaic system (SPVS) and solar hot water system (SHWS). Additionally, optimizations in the system design and life cycle costs were investigated to determine the annual optimal performance for the solar energy systems. The SHWS was installed at a less than optimum azimuth of 270° instead of 180° (corresponding to a 16% reduction in annual output). The SPVS was installed at optimal design conditions of 180° azimuth and 42° tilt. Payback and levelized cost of energy (LCOE) could have been minimized with the addition of another solar hot water collector with a minimal impact to overall cost. Cost sensitivity analysis on the LCOE and net-present value (NPV) were also performed and over a 30-year life cycle period, TMY3 based simulations predicted a NPV of $796 (21.8-year non-discounted payback) and -$1246 (29.2-year non-discounted payback) for the SHWS and SPVS, respectively. The SHWS achieved a LCOE of 8.1 ¢/kWh, while the value for the SPVS was 12.29 ¢/kWh. For the SPVS, the photovoltaic module and collector costs were the largest life cycle costs, and of special note, a reduction in the module cost by 67% reduces the LCOE to the market average-high electricity price of 10 ¢/kWh. Finally, the combined renewable energy systems generated an estimated 30-year life-cycle energy production of 184 814 kWh, with auxiliary gas provided for supplemental hot-water heating. On average, a Texas residential home utilizes 420 000 kWh of electrical energy, 19% of which is domestic hot water demand. © 2016 Author(s).",,"Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Commerce; Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Electric power generation; Energy utilization; Global warming; Heating; Hot water distribution systems; Housing; Photovoltaic cells; Renewable energy resources; Sensitivity analysis; Solar concentrators; Solar energy; Solar equipment; Solar power generation; Solar radiation; Uncertainty analysis; Water; Waterworks; Annual energy productions; Grid-connected photovoltaic system; Photovoltaic electricities; Probabilistic interpretation; Residential building energies; Solar hot water collectors; Solar photovoltaic system; Typical meteorological year; Life cycle",,,"American Institute of Physics Inc.",19417012,,,,"English","J.

Solar energy initiative is more than ever involved to tackle this issue, especially when deploying PV (photovoltaic) systems over large-scale residential areas. However, not all surfaces in these areas are economically suitable, while some surfaces have low CO2 mitigation. With the availability of high-resolution remote sensing data, the estimation of suitable rooftops for PV systems installation can be performed automatically by estimating the PV potential. This paper presents a novel method for estimating NPV (net present value) of the potential PV systems installed on rooftops by using LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) data and PV systems' nonlinear efficiency characteristics. More importantly, the environmental impact is estimated for each rooftop through EPBT (energy payback time) and GGER (greenhouse gas emission rate), based on the life-cycle of a specific PV system. This is combined with NPV in order to find rooftops that are both economically and environmentally viable candidates for PV systems deployment. Results demonstrate a case study LiDAR data for predicting each building's economical and environmental impact, as well as providing an overall view of resulting cumulative CO2 mitigation over large residential area. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","GGER; LiDAR; NPV; PV potential; PV systems; Solar energy","Carbon dioxide; Energy utilization; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Housing; Life cycle; Optical radar; Photovoltaic cells; Remote sensing; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Economic and environmental assessments; Efficiency characteristic; Energy pay back time; GGER; High resolution remote sensing; LIDAR (light detection and ranging); PV potential; PV system; Environmental impact; alternative energy; data set; economic analysis; environmental assessment; environmental economics; environmental impact; lidar; photovoltaic system; remote sensing; roof; solar power; Nucleopolyhedrovirus","Lukač, N.; University of Maribor, Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Smetanova ulica 17, Slovenia; email: niko.lukac@um.si",,"Elsevier Ltd",03605442,,ENEYD,,"English","Energy",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84966708006

The International Energy Agency (IEA) and the European Commission (EC) are attempting to achieve an 80% reduction in global emissions by 2050. The objectives of this paper are to identify the refurbishment scenario with the lowest environmental impact using Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and to assess the scenario's robustness to future climate change scenarios using a sensitivity analysis. We applied and verified the proposed approach in a residential case study of a reference project located in Kapfernberg, Austria. The environmental assessment included two façade refurbishment proposals (minimum and high quality with respect to energy), onsite energy generation (using solar thermal collectors and photovoltaic (PV) panels), one renewable future energy mix and the effects of climate change according to the Austrian Panel on Climate Change (APCC). The environmental indicators used in the assessment were the cumulative energy demand non-renewable (CED n. ren.), global warming potential (GWP) and ecological scarcity (UBP) over building life cycles. The results indicated that a high-quality refurbishment of the thermal envelope with prefabricated façade elements, including solar thermal collectors and PV panels, represented the optimal refurbishment. In terms of the environmental indicators, the high-quality refurbishment scenario is always beneficial throughout the building's life cycle. Additionally, the sensitivity analysis of the high-quality refurbishment scenario found an increasing production of surplus electricity with increasing PV area. This surplus of energy provides greater benefit in the short term with the current energy mix. Once the energy from the grid is shifted to renewable sources, the added benefit is decreased. Therefore, it is necessary to find an optimal balance between diminishing returns due to changes in the future energy mix and the financial investment made over the lifetime of the building, especially for plus energy buildings. However the findings from this specific case study need to be evaluated for other refurbishment cases, taking into account future local climate change and energy supply mix scenarios in other regions. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Although many researchers have assessed the operation of grid-connected photovoltaic systems with electric batteries, little attention has been paid to the impact of the electric batteries' degradation characteristics. This paper evaluates the operation of a grid-connected photovoltaic/electric-battery system in a house in terms of cost savings and energy savings. We constructed a long-term operational optimization model considering the degradation characteristics of the electric battery. This model contains two objective functions: energy savings and operating costs. We create a scenario of power rates and photovoltaic/battery system configurations. To reveal the optimal operational strategy for the photovoltaic/battery system, the multi-objective optimization problem was solved. As a result, Pareto-optimal solutions were obtained, and trade-off relationships between cost and energy savings are presented.

As financial incentives are being reduced or phased out, there is a possibility that adoption of this technology will slow down, thus creating a need for improved policy instruments targeted at adoption of residential PV systems. One of the factors affecting adoption of solar technology in the residential sector is its capitalisation in property values. Yet, the awareness of the capitalisation of PV investments in the Australian property market is limited. Our data indicate that homeowners who anticipate selling their properties in the near future are reluctant to adopt PV systems. This paper presents the first empirical estimate of the property price premiums associated with residential solar PV systems in Australia using residential property sales data from the Perth metropolitan area of Western Australia. An estimated 2.3–3.2 per cent property price premium associated with the PV systems suggests that homeowners fully recover the costs of PV investments upon the sale of their properties. Effective government policy could use this information to encourage adoption of residential PV systems by homeowners. © 2015 Australian Agricultural and Resource Economics Society Inc.","Australia; hedonic; photovoltaic; repeated sales; solar panels","alternative energy; capital; hedonic analysis; homeowner; investment; photovoltaic system; property market; renewable resource; residential location; solar power; technology adoption; Australia; Perth [Western Australia]; Western Australia",,,"Blackwell Publishing Ltd",1364985X,,,,"English","Aust.

In this framework, the MGs (Micro Grids) are classified as a distribution grid, usually in LV, able to provide services both in autonomous (island mode) and in grid connected mode. MGs are composed by traditional and renewable energy power plants, storages and loads and, due to their limited capacity, generally the main applications are on residential level (e.g., campus, hospitals, hotels, sport centers, commercial location). Different components, design and rules are defined by the manager of MG: in this work, there is a prosumer which aggregates the capacity of different components and buys or sells, for each hour, power from/to the grid with upper level voltage. In this paper, a decision making model to formulate the optimal bidding in the Day-Ahead energy market and to evaluate the risk management for a LV grid-connected residential MG, taking into account the uncertainty of renewable power production, i.e., PV (photovoltaic), is proposed. Several investigators have analyzed the role played by MGs into the deregulated electricity market, their contribution to energy price reduction and to the reliability system increase, as well as their impact on the best strategy devising to minimize operating costs.Although in literature it is possible to find similar decision support models, the use of uncertainty evaluation to make decisions and to participate in a deregulated energy market is at the present an important open research issue. The uncertainty can be expressed in many different ways, either qualitative or quantitative, and it is possible to generate a reasonable measure of uncertainty by various methods. In this work an original approach based on AnEn (Analog Ensemble) method to estimate the uncertainty linked to the energy provided by PV plant own to the MG is presented. The AnEn is able to estimate the pdf (probability density function) of forecasts solutions by sampling the uncertainty in the analysis and running a number of forecast from perturbed analysis. The analogs generated become the input of our optimization model.Based on a genetic algorithm, the economic model is applied to a heterogeneous residential MG with traditional different power plants and RES (Renewable Energy Sources), i.e., PV, evaluating different prosumer risk tolerances (adverse, neutral and incline). Developed methodology can aid the decision maker to understand the potential impact of a wrong decision throughout information included in a forecast concerning renewable power production. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology is assessed through the analysis of a case study consisting of a grid connected residential MG. The obtained results show different optimal bids depending on the risk adversity with respect to the uncertainty of PV power production, and how PV energy production can be integrated with optimal results in a MG if the prosumer's strategy takes into account the uncertainty linked to the energy output. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Analog ensemble; Day-ahead energy market; Micro grid; Optimization bidding strategy; Uncertainty analysis","Commerce; Decision making; Decision support systems; Deregulation; Electric power generation; Electric power transmission networks; Forecasting; Genetic algorithms; Housing; Optimization; Probability density function; Renewable energy resources; Risk management; Uncertainty analysis; Analog ensemble; Bidding strategy; Day-ahead energy markets; Deregulated electricity market; Deregulated energy market; Micro grid; PDF(probability density function); Renewable power production; Power markets; alternative energy; cost analysis; decision making; deregulation; energy market; energy planning; optimization; photovoltaic system; price determination; renewable resource; risk assessment; uncertainty analysis","Ferruzzi, G.; Department of Geography, The Pennsylvania State UniversityUnited States; email: ferruzzi@psu.edu",,"Elsevier Ltd",03605442,,ENEYD,,"English","Energy",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84962128775

This study is twofold; the first part proposes an energy management system that combines demand side management strategies with a view of minimizing the consumer's cost and reducing the power consumption from the grid. Appliance scheduling with a dedicated photovoltaic and storage system under time-of-use tariff shows that customers can realize cost savings and the power demanded from the grid is reduced by optimal scheduling of power sources. In the second part of this study, a model is developed to investigate the joint influence of price and CO2 emissions. It is found that CO2 emissions could give customers an environmental motivation to shift loads during peak hours, as it would enable co-optimization of electricity consumption costs and carbon emissions reductions. It is also demonstrated that the consumer's preferences on the cost sub-functions of energy, inconvenience and carbon emissions affects the consumption pattern. These results are important for both the consumer and the electricity suppliers, as they illustrate the optimal decisions considered in the presence of trade-offs between multiple objectives. A further study crucial to the consumer on economic analysis of PV and battery system showed that the consumer could recoup their initial investment within 5 years of their investment. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The current study analyzes the techno-economic feasibility of different PV hybrid power systems using the RETScreen Clean Energy Project Analysis Software for a typical household in Urumqi, China. The solar radiation data of Urumqi is taken from the National Aeronautics and Space Administrative (NASA) database. In Urumqi, the global solar radiation ranges from 1.93 to 5.92 kWh/m2/day, and the annual average scale is predicted to be 4.2 kWh/m2/day. Furthermore, the electrical load consumed by a household in this region is 10.275 kWh/day with 5.7 kW peak demand. In this paper, the electricity generation, financial viability, greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions, and sensitivity analyses are discussed. Three solar tracking models (fixed, one-axis and two-axis) for the off-grid residential PV power systems have been considered. The considered off-grid PV power systems are projected to annually produce approximately 3.68 MWh (fixed tilt arrays), 3.79 MWh (one-axis), and 3.83 MWh (two-axis) of alternating current electricity delivered for a typical household in Urumqi. The PV/diesel/battery power system is the most economic feasible scenario, whereas the diesel power system is the most expensive for a household in Urumqi. In addition, the minimum value of the GHG emission reduction is 5.5 tCO2/year for an off-grid PV system with fixed tilt arrays, while the maximum value of GHG emission reduction is 5.6 tCO2/year for an off-grid PV system with a one-axis or two-axis tracking module. The off-grid PV/battery power system with a one-axis or two-axis tracking module can offer the best performance in terms of GHG reduction. In addition, the NPV and GHG reduction cost values increase with the increases of the fuel cost escalation rate, inflation rate, and project life, whereas the two values decrease with the increase of the discount rate. Therefore, the economic and environmental factors heavily influence the selection of a solar tracking model (fixed, one-axis, or two-axis) for an off-grid PV hybrid power system for a household in Urumqi, China. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

A key finding is that time-of-day (ToD) pricing can enhance or worsen the economics of PV systems. Moreover, increased responsiveness of electricity demand to its price diminishes the effectiveness of ToD pricing in the absence of net metering, but does not affect it otherwise. An application to plausible conditions in the State of Indiana, USA, shows that current policies are unlikely to trigger adoption by a risk-neutral forward-looking residential customer. However, adoption of PV systems can be induced if the Federal Tax Credit is increased to cover 48% of capital cost (instead of the current 30%), which could imply a cost to the Federal Government of about $0.95/kW of installed capacity depending on the panel's size. We demonstrate that implementation of ToD pricing can trigger adoption under a range of on- and off-peak price combinations. But our analysis also shows that the cost-effectiveness of ToD pricing is enhanced at higher ratios of on-peak to off-peak prices. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Demand responsiveness; Policy cost-effectiveness; Price volatility; Real options; Solar photovoltaic; Time-of-day pricing","Cost benefit analysis; Cost effectiveness; Economics; Housing; Photovoltaic cells; Photovoltaic effects; Solar power generation; Taxation; Demand responsiveness; Price volatility; Real Options; Solar photovoltaics; Time of day; Costs; cost-benefit analysis; demand analysis; energy policy; photovoltaic system; pricing policy; solar power; Indiana; Midwest; United States","Sesmero, J.; Department of Agricultural Economics, Purdue UniversityUnited States; email: jsesmero@purdue.edu",,"Elsevier Ltd",03014215,,ENPYA,,"English","Energy Policy",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84959419780

The investigation puts emphasis on the energy production and cost of energy from both wind turbine and photovoltaic (PV) in the hybrid system. Unmet electric load and excess electricity are taken into consideration. The annual average solar irradiation and wind speed considered in this study are 5.95 kWh/m2/day and 3.53 m/s, respectively. MATLAB and HOMER software are used to perform the technical and economic analyses of the hybrid system. As indicated from the simulation results, the PV array shares more electricity production than the wind turbine generator if both wind turbine and PV array are utilized in the wind/solar hybrid system with the same sizes. The wind levelized cost of energy is $0.149/kWh, which is more expensive than the solar energy of $0.0637/kWh.

As is the case in many countries, Iraq is home to a collection of remote villages. Since it is uneconomical to connect these villages to the existing grid, the installation of standalone electrical power generators has become common practice. As a result, diesel stand-alone power generators see widespread use in these remote locales, which, whilst fit for their intended purpose, unfortunately suffer from several drawbacks, including instability in regards to everyday oil prices and a number of environmental issues. The implementation of a PV/FC hybrid power system could be one potential alternative to help solve these problems. Therefore, this paper will present PV/FC system control strategies alongside information relating to the performance of such system components, based on a case study that was conducted in Al-Gowair, Iraq. This study is especially important in terms of envisioning the future energy supply needs of Iraq. The HOMER simulation results showed that by using the proposed control strategies and suggested components of a PV/FC system, it was able to produce a satisfactory outcome. © 2016 Universitas Ahmad Dahlan.","Diesel generator; Fuel cells; Hybrid power system.; photovoltaic; Remote area.","Fuel cells; Hybrid systems; Rural areas; Diesel generators; Electrical energy supply; Electrical power generators; Environmental issues; Hybrid power systems; Performance analysis; Photovoltaic; Remote areas; Energy resources","Sidik, M.A.B.; Department of Electrical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Universitas SriwijayaIndonesia",,"Universitas Ahmad Dahlan",16936930,,,,"English","Telkomnika Telecomun.

Hence, the objective of the present study is to achieve the optimal configuration of a Micro-Grid System (MGS) supplying a predefined load of 76 kW peak. Both technical and economic performances are investigated taking environmental impacts into consideration. The intended load is the estimated power required for two small factories and the MGS is investigated performing as on-grid or standalone. The MGS components are: a number of Photovoltaic (PV) panels, smallscale Wind Turbines (WT), Battery storage units (B) and a back-up Generator (D.G). The economic appraisal criteria adopted for optimization are 4Cost of Energy (COE) and Net Present Cost (NPC). As for technical performance assessment, a specific power shortage percent is used as a constraint to insure load sustainability. Applying HOMER simulation package, it was found that (WT/PV) on-grid system is more economic than (WT/PV/DG/B) off-grid system as COE is 0.266 $/kWh and 0.316 $/kWh, respectively. To assess the external benefits of MGS, the cost of Carbon Dioxide (CO2) emissions; for off-grid system, is evaluated and the modified COE has reached 0.256 $/kWh, compared to 0.266 $/kWh for on-grid case.

This paper proposes a novel methodology, aimed to optimize the design of the mix of renewable energy systems for the integration of building energy demand in terms of energy uses for space heating/cooling, domestic hot water and electric devices. More in detail, a multi-objective optimization is performed by considering two contrasting objectives to be minimized: primary energy demand and investment cost. The global cost is investigated too, as further criterion, in order to detect the cost-optimal solution. Moreover, the fulfillment of the minimum levels of RES integration - as provided by Italian regulations - is taken into account as constraint. The optimization procedure is based on a genetic algorithm, which is performed by employing EnergyPlus and MATLAB®.

Although several programs are available that assist in designing a photovoltaic (PV) system, a planning tool that can take an adaptive modeling approach towards capitalizing on the complex geometry of a rooftop does not exist. We therefore focus on the development of a parametric planning tool for retrofitting rooftops with solar photovoltaic systems. The solar planning tool exploits the existing blueprint of a building's rooftop, and via image processing, the layouts of the solar photovoltaic arrays are developed based on the building's geographical location and typical weather patterns. The resulting energy generation of a PV system is estimated and is utilized to determine the leveled energy costs. The advantage of incorporating image processing in the design of a PV system not only reduces the time required for performing a robust solar PV analysis but also enables a high-level of dimensional precision when modeling the solar arrays, thus making a rooftop solar photovoltaic system installation ultimately more cost-effective. This paper demonstrates the planning tool and verifies the output array layout, sizing of the balance of system components, and expected energy generation with the existing rooftop photovoltaic systems. © 2016 Author(s).",,"Cost benefit analysis; Cost effectiveness; Image processing; Optical variables measurement; Photovoltaic cells; Solar cell arrays; Solar concentrators; Solar equipment; Complex geometries; Dimensional precision; Geographical locations; Photovoltaic systems; Residential building; Rooftop photovoltaic systems; Solar photovoltaic system; Solar photovoltaics; Solar power generation",,,"American Institute of Physics Inc.",19417012,,,,"English","J.

Nevertheless, Malaysia's PV installation capacity is relatively small compared with the global PV capacity. Significantly, the pricing mechanisms for grid-connected PV projects need to be appropriately assessed to build up the public's confidence to invest in PV projects. In this paper, we analyze the effects of component costs, FiTs (feed-in tariffs), and carbon taxes on grid-connected PV systems in Malaysian residential sector using the HOMER (Hybrid Optimization of Multiple Energy Resources) software. Results demonstrate that the implementation of grid-connected PV systems is highly feasible with PV array costs of $ 1120/kW or lower. For higher PV array costs up to $ 2320/kW, introducing an FiT rate three times higher ($ 0.30/kWh) than the grid tariff for a 100 kW grid sale capacity will, NPC-wise, prioritize grid-connected PV systems over the utility grid. By implementing the FiT ($ 0.50/kWh) and the carbon tax ($ 36/metric ton) schemes simultaneously, grid-connected PV systems will remain as the optimal systems even for costly PV arrays (up to $ 4000/kW). The findings are of paramount importance as far as PV pricing variability is concerned. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Carbon taxes; Component costs; Feed-in tariffs; Grid-connected photovoltaic; HOMER (Hybrid Optimization of Multiple Energy Resources); Residential","Energy resources; Housing; Photovoltaic cells; Photovoltaic effects; Solar power generation; Taxation; Carbon taxes; Component costs; Feed-in tariff; Grid-connected photovoltaic; Hybrid optimization; Residential; Costs; cost analysis; environmental economics; installation; photovoltaic system; pollution tax; residential energy; solar radiation; Malaysia","Lau, K.Y.; Institute of High Voltage and High Current, Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Universiti Teknologi MalaysiaMalaysia; email: kwanyiew@utm.my",,"Elsevier Ltd",03605442,,ENEYD,,"English","Energy",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84959476714

For residential building energy, we show that total cost is minimized by equating marginal cost of building energy conserved with marginal cost of obtaining carbon-free energy, where we express costs of both in dollars per kWh. We describe how the cost of solar photovoltaic energy provides an upper bound on the marginal cost of carbon-free energy and thus an upper bound on marginal cost of conserved energy-one should not necessarily spend more on energy conservation than the cost of photovoltaic energy (though there are several caveats). A case study from Vermont, USA illustrates these principles and implementation issues with marginal analysis of energy conservation. From a policy perspective, the principles presented suggest that either carbon taxes or carbon limits could be used to decarbonize building energy at minimum cost, but that approaches using renewable-energy subsidies or prescriptive building codes result in greater decarbonization costs to society. This suggests that new policy approaches be adopted. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Building energy; Cost of conserved energy (CCE); Decarbonization; Equimarginal principle; Renewable energy economics","Building codes; Buildings; Climate change; Cost effectiveness; Decarbonization; Economics; Energy conservation; Free energy; Housing; Solar power generation; Building energy; Cost-effective approach; Equimarginal principle; Marginal analysis; Photovoltaic energy; Renewable energies; Residential building energies; Solar photovoltaic energies; Costs; alternative energy; cost-benefit analysis; energy conservation; energy policy; photovoltaic system; pollution tax; renewable resource; residential energy; solar power; United States; Vermont","Timmons, D.; Economics Department, University of Massachusetts Boston, 100 Morrissey Blvd, United States; email: david.timmons@umb.edu",,"Elsevier Ltd",03014215,,ENPYA,,"English","Energy Policy",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84959225698

To quantify these problems this work proposes a probabilistic impact assessment methodology. First, realistic 5-min time-series daily profiles are produced for photovoltaic panels, electric heat pumps, electric vehicles, and micro combined heat and power units. Then, to cater for the uncertainties of LCTs (e.g., size, location, and behavior), a Monte Carlo analysis is carried out considering 100 simulations for different penetration levels (percentage of houses with a LCT). This methodology is applied to 128 real U.K. LV feeders showing that about half of them can have voltage and/or congestion issues at some penetration of LCTs. Furthermore, to identify the relationships between the first occurrence of problems and key feeder parameters (e.g., length, number of customers), a correlation analysis is developed per LCT. Crucially, these results can be translated into lookup tables to help distribution network operators in producing preliminary estimates of the LCT hosting capacity of a given feeder. © 2015 IEEE.","Distributed generation; electric heat pumps; electric vehicles; low carbon technologies; low-voltage networks; micro combined heat and power; photovoltaic systems; power distribution","Amphibious vehicles; Crashworthiness; Electric power distribution; Electric power generation; Feeding; Heating; Monte Carlo methods; Photovoltaic cells; Uncertainty analysis; Correlation analysis; Distribution network operators; Low-carbon technologies; Low-voltage distributions; Micro-combined heat and power; Monte carlo analysis; Photovoltaic panels; Probabilistic impact; Probability distributions",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",08858950,,ITPSE,,"English","IEEE Trans Power Syst",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84937231895

The average daily solar radiation in this region is equal to 7.82 kWh/m2/day and the wind reaches a speed between 5 and 11 m/s. In this paper, we proceed to evaluate the technical and economic feasibility of using a hybrid generation system to satisfy the electricity demand for Timiaouine town, which is located in the extreme southwestern part of Algeria. Timiaouine, with more than 200 families, is not connected to the power grid. The feasibility of various configurations of renewable power generation was evaluated. The optimization results predict that 100% of the electricity demand could be supplied to the town by using a hybrid configuration composed of a wind energy system, a solar PV system and a diesel generator used as a backup system.

PV systems and EVs will contribute to reducing CO2 emissions in the residential sector and the transportation sector, respectively. In spite of that, high penetration of PV systems into the power grid can cause grid voltage and frequency stability problems. Also, the growth of the EV market will create an extra electricity load (for charging the EV fleet), leading to an increase in power utility fuel costs. In this research, we proposed the usage of the PV-EV system as a method of mitigating the impact the spread of residential PV systems and EV on the power grid. We built an PV-EV system simulation model and investigated the PV-EV system contribution to the balance of power supply and demand and to reducing the total cost of the household under different electricity pricing scenarios.

The results show that PV-based systems are beneficial under a variety of economic conditions and fuel prices when compared to systems solely fuel-based. Incandescent lights, which are currently common for such settlements, should be replaced with LED lighting to enable easier PV system portability by reindeer sled.

However, system cost is not the only barrier faced by solar adopters. Potential adopters also face various informational barriers, leading to high indirect costs during the information search process. There is a significant gap in the literature for empirical work on solar adoption linking how the information context (installer marketing; neighbors with solar, i.e., peer effects; etc.) interacts with a potential adopter's motivations to impact decision outcomes. To address this gap we present results of a new survey on the decision-making process of residential PV adopters in northern California. The main aspects of our analysis include: salient motivating factors, information gathering process, peer effects, role of installers, and factors driving the choice of outright purchase versus third-party ownership (e.g., leasing) modes of adoption. We find that installers and neighbors play important, but often supplementary, roles throughout the decision-making process and have influence on both the decision to adopt as well as on the mode of adoption. Furthermore, expected financial returns and concerns about operations and maintenance are the main determining factors for the mode of adoption. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Consumer behavior; Individual decision-making; Information channels; Leasing; Peer effects; Solar photovoltaic (PV)","Consumer behavior; Costs; Decision making; Housing; Motivation; Photovoltaic effects; Solar concentrators; Individual decision making; Information channels; Leasing; Peer effects; Solar photovoltaics; Solar power generation; decision making; hardware; information system; maintenance; ownership; photovoltaic system; solar power; survey; technology adoption; California; United States","Rai, V.; The University of Texas at Austin, 2315 Red River St., United States; email: raivarun@utexas.edu",,"Elsevier Ltd",09601481,,,,"English","Renew.

This paper presented an economic feasibility analysis of a single standalone house operating with a hybrid power plant consisting of a fixed capacity producer gas generator (2 kWe) and other renewable energy sources (Photovoltaic and wind). The National Renewable Energy Laboratory's Hybrid Optimization Model for Electric Renewable (HOMER) was employed which evaluated techno-economic analysis based on the criteria of net present cost and levelized cost of electricity. Taking the site specific daily average solar radiation, average wind speed and load data into account, renewable hybrid model consisting of Bio/PV (Photovoltaic)/wind/battery/capacitor was found feasible giving 19,866 kWh/yr. of energy with a levelized cost of electricity of 0.306 kWh/yr. While comparing the hybrid system with a diesel or, natural gas generator alone, the maximum savings from CO2 emissions worth 22,626 kg/yr. was achieved. The sensitivity analysis over a range of diesel/natural/producer gas price (0.1 $/L to 1 $/L or, 0.1 $/m3 to 1.0 $/m3) showed that in addition to the environmental benefits hybrid energy configuration could result economic advantages when the producer gas price does not exceed the threshold of 0.1 $/m3. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Hybrid energy; Optimum solution; Sensitivity analysis; Techno-economic","Carbon dioxide; Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Gas emissions; Gas generators; Gases; Hybrid systems; Optimization; Renewable energy resources; Sensitivity analysis; Solar power generation; Wind; Economic feasibility analysis; Hybrid energy; Levelized cost of electricities; National Renewable Energy Laboratory; Optimum solution; Renewable energy source; Techno-Economic analysis; Techno-economics; Economic analysis; diesel; energy resource; feasibility study; household energy; optimization; photovoltaic system; power generation; power plant; renewable resource; sensitivity analysis; technological development; Norway","Sarker, S.; University of Agder, Faculty of Engineering and Science, Serviceboks 509, Norway; email: shiplu.sarker@uia.no",,"Elsevier Ltd",09601481,,,,"English","Renew.

In the not-too-distant future the use of renewable energy such as wind and solar will be very important and will play predominant role in economic indices of power systems. In recent years, technological advances in renewable energy and increasing price of petroleum products promote system managers to use low-cost and lowemission energy resources in form of hybrid systems and widespread propagation of electricity generation have been developed in remote areas. In Hybrid systems two or more sources of renewable energy is typically adopted, which increases the reliability of these systems. In this paper, the technical and economical consideration of a wind and solar hybrid system to supply electrical energy for a number of remote users (aid and medical emergency Shelter in Yazd) is provided. In order to investigate optimization and economic analysis of the proposed hybrid system, the HOMER software is used.

In this work, rather than designing a high-reliable electricity generation system with high-quality power, our objective is to provide the basic configuration of an energy mix for a rural area for which energy data are not of high resolution. The selection of technologies is accomplished through a non-linear integer programming model that minimises the levelised cost of electricity (LCOE). The model uses as inputs information related to the energy resources, the conversion technologies, the Honduran economic framework, the electricity demand of the study area, and the energy storage cost. The evaluated energy resources are solar, wind, and local biomass, while the electricity generation technologies considered include solar photovoltaics, wind turbines, biomass direct combustion with a steam turbine, and biomass gasification with a gas engine. Three different case studies were proposed as functions of power capacity: off-grid, mini-grid, and grid-connected. For each case study, the model outputs are the electricity supply share for each technology, the LCOE, and the number of power plants with the respective power capacity required to satisfy the electricity demand of the study area.

The results indicate that Italy's support system has been the most profitable out of the countries studied since 2010. In general, under current support policies, residential installations are still profitable in most cases, despite decreasing support levels, except for Spain. Furthermore, the paper demonstrates that self-consumption can significantly increase profits, especially in Spain and Germany. However, Flanders' policy has no effect on levels of self-consumption. Finally, a comparison of past and present policies shows the varying levels of success countries have enjoyed in keeping the profitability of investments stable over the years, depending on the efficiency of their support policy.

Since PV system cost is decreasing and the electricity market is constantly evolving there is marked interest in understanding the performance and economic benefits of adding battery systems to PV generation under different retail tariffs. The performance of lead-acid (PbA) and lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery systems in combination with PV generation for a single home in Switzerland is studied using a time-dependant analysis. Firstly, the economic benefits of the two battery types are analysed for three different types of tariffs, i.e. a dynamic tariff based on the wholesale market (one price per hour for every day of the year), a flat rate and time-of-use tariff with two periods. Secondly, the reduction of battery capacity and annual discharge throughout the battery lifetime are simulated for PbA and Li-ion batteries. It was found that despite the levelised value of battery systems reaches up to 28% higher values with the dynamic tariff compared to the flat rate tariff, the levelised cost increases by 94% for the dynamic tariff, resulting in lower profitability. The main reason for this is the reduction of equivalent full cycles performed with by battery systems with the dynamic tariff. Economic benefits also depend on the regulatory context and Li-ion battery systems were able to achieve internal rate of return (IRR) up to 0.8% and 4.3% in the region of Jura (Switzerland) and Germany due to higher retail electricity prices (0.25. CHF/kW. h and 0.35. CHF/kW. h respectively) compared to Geneva (0.22.

In addition, the techno-economic feasibility of utilizing hybrid photovoltaic/wind/diesel with battery storage systems to meet the load of a typical rural healthcare facility at the selected sites were assessed. The optimum dimensions of the system are defined for the locations. Hybrid Optimization Model for Electric Renewable (HOMER) software developed by National Renewable Energy Laboratory's (NREL) was employed to conduct the study. Findings from the study showed that Sokoto and Jos exist in the high wind potential regions, while the remain sites are only suitable for small wind applications. Values obtained for global, beam and diffuse radiation as well as clearness index, show that all the sites enjoy considerable solar energy potential suitable for varying degree of solar energy applications. Monthly optimum tilt angle for Iseyin, Sokoto, Maiduguri, Jos, Enugu and Port-Harcourt lies in the range of 0-39.8°, 0-44.5°, 0-44.1°, 0-43.2°, 0-38.5° and 0-36.3° respectively thereby having the optimum angle to be equal to 0° in all sites in April, May, June, July and August. The simulation results from HOMER indicate that the hybrid system is the best option for all the sites considered in this study. The PV/wind/diesel/battery hybrid system configuration is considered optimum for RHC applications at Sokoto, Maiduguri, Jos and Enugu, while hybrid systems involving PV/diesel/battery is considered ideal for RHC at remote locations within Iseyin and Port-Harcourt, due to the quality of renewable energy potential.

Among those supportive policies is net metering, which in most states effectively allows customers to receive compensation for distributed PV generation at the full retail electricity price. The current design of retail electricity rates and the presence of net metering have elicited concerns that the possible under-recovery of fixed utility costs from PV system owners may lead to a feedback loop of increasing retail prices that accelerate PV adoption and further rate increases. However, a separate and opposing feedback loop could offset this effect: increased PV deployment may lead to a shift in the timing of peak-period electricity prices that could reduce the bill savings received under net metering where time-varying retail electricity rates are used, thereby dampening further PV adoption. In this paper, we examine the impacts of these two competing feedback dynamics on U.S. distributed PV deployment through 2050 for both residential and commercial customers, across states. Our results indicate that, at the aggregate national level, the two feedback effects nearly offset one another and therefore produce a modest net effect, although their magnitude and direction vary by customer segment and by state. We also model aggregate PV deployment trends under various rate designs and net-metering rules, accounting for feedback dynamics. Our results demonstrate that future adoption of distributed PV is highly sensitive to retail rate structures. Whereas flat, time-invariant rates with net metering lead to higher aggregate national deployment levels than the current mix of rate structures (+5% in 2050), rate structures with higher monthly fixed customer charges or PV compensation at levels lower than the full retail rate can dramatically erode aggregate customer adoption of PV (from -14% to -61%, depending on the design). Moving towards time-varying rates, on the other hand, accelerates near- and medium-term deployment (through 2030) but slows adoption in the longer term (-22% in 2050). © 2015.","Electricity rate; Feedback; Net metering; Photovoltaics; Rate design; Solar","Aggregates; Costs; Design; Feedback; Photovoltaic cells; Solar power generation; Structural design; Commercial customers; Financing innovation; Net metering; Photovoltaics; Retail rate design; Solar; Solar photovoltaics; Supportive policies; Sales; design; electricity generation; energy market; energy use; innovation; photovoltaic system; solar power; United States","Darghouth, N.R.; Ernest Orlando Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, 1 Cyclotron Road, United States; email: ndarghouth@lbl.gov",,"Elsevier Ltd",03062619,,APEND,,"English","Appl.

A predictive scheduling layer is developed as a part of a complete load management process. The main objective of the study is to ensure a permanent power supply for a high energy consuming residential application. The control algorithm plans the activation of predictable loads 24 h ahead through compromising between a decrease in the resulting discomfort levels and the conservation of a high autonomy of the system. The strength of the developed control lies in ensuring the complete coordination between all the components of the installation: the grid, PV panels, battery storage, and the load demand. No loss of power supply is allowed during the day and realistic and technical constraints are applied. The demand side management program is formulated as a multi-objective optimization algorithm solved using the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) technique. A fuzzy logic decision maker is developed for an automatic trade-off process implementing the residents' preferences. The simulation results show excellent performance and flexibility of the proposed algorithm.

Conventional windows tend to have poor glazing properties, which causes significant heat loss during the winter season and undesirable heat gain during the summer season. Advanced window technologies are therefore required to mitigate the energy consumption of buildings. The key hypothesis in this study is that advanced windows become economically viable for end-users if the difference in life-cycle cost between advanced window types and the state-of-the-art (reference) window is equal to zero. To verify this hypothesis, we calculate the allowable additional investment costs (dIC) for three types of advanced windows over a given life span. Different advanced windows; electrochromic, PV and vacuum windows together with a self-cleaning feature were compared with a state-of-the-art window with excellent properties (reference window) in terms of energy performance and life-cycle cost for a conceptual residential house (i.e. townhouse) in Finland. By performing a whole-building simulation using IDA ICE, the impact of these windows on the total delivered energy needs of the townhouse were estimated. Among the alternatives, the vacuum window (lowest U-value) offers the highest dIC value, due to its maximum energy savings. With a generic efficiency of 6%, the PV window holds the intermediate position between the vacuum and reference window in terms of dIC value. Hypothetically, with a U-value of 0.6W/m2K, the PV window would become the most energy efficient window alternative. The self-cleaning feature proved to be a dominant factor toward the increase of dIC value by avoiding maintenance costs. Electrochromic glazing is not economically feasible due to its negative dIC value as it doesn't offer life cycle cost savings. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Advanced window; Building energy; Economic viability; Life cycle cost; Townhouse","Costs; Economics; Electrochromism; Energy conservation; Energy dissipation; Energy utilization; Glazes; Heating; Houses; Investments; Life cycle; Uranium; Building energy; Building simulation; Economic viability; Economically viable; Electrochromic glazings; Energy-efficient windows; Lifecycle costs; Townhouse; Energy efficiency; economic activity; energy efficiency; energy use; hypothesis testing; life cycle analysis; performance assessment; Finland","Pal, S.K.; Department of Energy Technology, Aalto University, P.O.

The aim of this work is to design and dynamically simulate a novel ultra-high efficient solar heating and cooling system. The overall plant layout is designed to supply electricity, space heating and cooling and domestic hot water for a small residential building. The system combines solar cooling, solar-assisted heat pump and photovoltaic/thermal collector technologies in a novel solar polygeneration system. In fact, the polygeneration system is based on a PVT solar field, coupled with a water-to-water electric heat pump or to an adsorption chiller. PVT collectors simultaneously produce electricity and thermal energy. During the winter, hot water produced by PVT collectors primarily supplies the evaporator of the heat pump, whereas in summer, solar energy supplies an adsorption chiller providing the required space cooling. All year long, solar thermal energy in excess is converted into DHW (domestic hot water). The system model was developed in TRNSYS environment. 1-year dynamic simulations are performed for different case studies in various weather conditions. The results are analysed on different time bases presenting energetic, environmental and economic performance data. Finally, a sensitivity analysis and a thermoeconomic optimization were performed, in order to determine the set of system design/control parameters that minimize the simple pay-back period. The results showed a total energy efficiency of the PVT of 49%, a heat pump yearly coefficient of performance for heating mode above 4 and a coefficient of performance of the adsorption chiller of 0.55. Finally, it is also concluded that system performance is highly sensitive to the PVT field area. The system is profitable when a capital investment subsidy of 50% is considered. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Adsorption chiller; Heat pump; Heating and cooling system; PVT (photovoltaic/thermal); Solar cooling; Solar energy","Adsorption; Cooling; Cooling systems; Economic analysis; Energy efficiency; Heat pump systems; Heating; Hot water distribution systems; Investments; Pumps; Sensitivity analysis; Solar collectors; Solar energy; Solar heating; Thermal energy; Thermoelectric equipment; Thermography (temperature measurement); Water; Adsorption chiller; Heat pumps; Heating and cooling systems; Photovoltaic/thermal; Solar cooling; Solar power generation; adsorption; building; climate conditions; dynamic analysis; economic analysis; energy efficiency; optimization; photovoltaic system; solar power; thermal power","Figaj, R.D.; Department of Engineering, University of Naples Parthenope, Centro Direzionale.

Recently, grid connected PV micro-generation facilities in individual homes have increased due to governmental policies as well as greater attention by industry. As low voltage (LV) distribution systems were built to make energy flow in one direction, the power feed-in of PV generation in rural low-voltage grids can influence power quality (PQ) as well as facility operation and reliability. This paper presents results on PQ analysis of a real PV generation facility connected to a rural low-voltage grid. Voltage fluctuations and voltage harmonic contents were observed. Statistical analysis shows a negative impact on PQ produced by this PV facility and also that only a small fraction of the energy available during a sunny day is converted, provoking losses of revenue and forcing the converter to work in an undesirable operating mode. We discuss the disturbances imposed upon the grid and their outcome regarding technical and economic viability of the PV system, as well as possible solutions. A low-voltage grid strengthening has been suggested and implemented. After that a new PQ analysis shows an improvement in the impact upon PQ, making this facility economically viable. © 2016 by the Authors.","Economic viability of the PV; Grid connected; Photovoltaic (PV) micro generation; Voltage fluctuations","Economics; Electric power generation; Electric power transmission networks; Photovoltaic cells; Economic viability; Governmental policies; Grid-connected; Grid-connected photovoltaic; Low-voltage distributions; Microgeneration; Photovoltaic generation; Voltage fluctuations; Power quality","Mariano, S.; Instituto de Telecomunicações, Calçada Fonte do LameiroPortugal; email: sm@ubi.pt",,"MDPI AG",19961073,,,,"English","Energies",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84987962133

Hawaii is an interesting case because of its generous tax credits and fast growing PV installations. We find that rising electricity rates and declining PV installation costs have driven PV deployment through an increasing internal rate of return on PV investment since 2009. The state tax credit favors high-income households who have higher tax liabilities and are more likely to break the largest barrier to market entry, home ownership. The internal rate of return for the typical Hawaii household is 25% and 16% with and without the state tax credit. We estimate that single-family homeowners in Hawaii may ultimately demand as much as 1100 MW of PV, which would play an important role in meeting Hawaii's clean energy goal of achieving 100% renewable sources for electricity by the year 2045. It would also cost the taxpayer $1.4 billion.

The main aim was to assess the feasibility and economic viability of wind and solar resources for hybrid energy system that can provide sustainable electricity for rural communities unconnected to the national grid. Rural communities made up of 200 homes, a school and health center was conceived. Specific electric load profile, of 358 kWh per day, with 46 kW primary and 20 kW deferrable peak loads, was planned to match the rural communities. The daily data utilized were obtained from the Nigeria Meteorological Department and comprise of mean wind speeds, global solar radiation, sunshine hours air temperatures, relative humidity for periods spanning 1987-2010. The assessment of the design that will optimally meet the daily load demand with LOLP of 0.01 was carried out by considering 3 standalone applications of PV, wind and diesel, and a hybrid design of wind-PV. The diesel standalone system was taken as the benchmark. The result showed that the hybrid system gave the most cost-effective alternative at 5 different locations (Potiskum, Nguru, Bauchi, Ibi and Yola). However, for Maiduguri, the wind standalone system proved to be the optimal means of renewable electricity in terms of life cycle and levelised costs. The values ranged between $0.17/kWh for Maiduguri (Wind) and $0.40/kWh for Yola (hybrid). This is competitive with grid electricity, which is presently about 0.10/kWh. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper analyses the use of residential lead–acid energy storage coupled with photovoltaics and its possible interaction with the grid for different limits of feed-in power without any support policies. In the literature, these subjects are often treated independently and for very specific, non-optimised cases, thus motivating further research. Results show that reaching self-sufficiency values up to 40% is possible, close to grid parity values, and only with photovoltaics. Beyond 40%, energy storage must be used, strongly raising the cost of the electricity consumed and therefore the need for support policies for widespread adoption. Also, peak power consumption from the grid remains constant and load variability rises, suggesting that an increase in self-sufficiency would be accompanied by lower utilisation factors of power plants and, consequently, higher wholesale electricity prices during no sunshine hours. Limiting feed-in power attenuates the increased load variability and only slightly affects the economic viability of such installations. These results present a novel optimisation tool for developers and should be considered in future studies of distributed photovoltaics and energy storage as well as in energy policy. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Distributed energy storage; Home energy storage; Lead–acid battery energy storage; Levelised Cost of Energy (LCOE); Photovoltaics (PV); Self-sufficiency","Chemical contamination; Costs; Electric batteries; Electric energy storage; Electric power utilization; Energy storage; Acid batteries; Distributed energy storages; Levelised cost of energies; Photovoltaics; Self-sufficiency; Electric power transmission networks; cost analysis; electricity generation; energy efficiency; energy policy; energy use; fuel cell; household energy; photovoltaic system; price dynamics","de Oliveira e Silva, G.; Aero-Thermo-Mechanics Dept.

Such benefits could be declining costs of PV systems thus tempting investors to hold off and wait for a better moment to invest.

Whilst often portrayed as a technical matter, orchestrated through the top-down intervention of major corporate or government actors, such shifts in the system of electricity provision also entail efforts to fundamentally reconfigure relationships between providers and consumers, and rearticulate energy practices so that they are aligned to new governmental rationales. In this paper, we draw on theories of governmentality and social practice to consider the ways in which the smart grid is serving to constitute new forms of energy conduct, which in turn are vital to the ways in which smart grids are realised. Through the analysis of the first findings from an industry regulator–funded project in the north of England, we consider how and with what implications households that have installed solar photovoltaic (PV) technologies are fitting smart grid techniques and devices into their everyday practices. We argue that in contrast to households where solar PV has been regarded primarily as a device to deliver new flows of finance, the introduction of smart grid logics through the installation of in-home displays and hot water storage has served to rearticulate what ‘good’ electricity conduct entails and to reconfigure the ways in which energy-intensive practices are undertaken in households. We find these new forms of ‘governing the self’ to be critical in shaping how, and to what effect, the smart grid is taking root. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.","conduct; governmentality; practice theory; Smart grid; solar PV","electricity supply; government; household energy; industrial regulation; photovoltaic system; resource development; solar power; utility sector; England; United Kingdom","Powells, G.; School of Geography, Politics and Sociology, Newcastle University, Daysh Building, Claremont Road, United Kingdom; email: gareth.powells@newcastle.ac.uk",,"SAGE Publications Ltd",0308518X,,,,"English","Environ.

An overview of financing mechanisms for solar and other renewable energies around the world is also presented followed by current mechanisms available in Mexico. The first proposal is centered around the operation of a solar energy service company that would receive the avoided cost of generation as compensation in return for sourcing, installing, and maintaining solar PV systems on residential users' roofs. This would free up the residential user from any future electricity payments. The second proposal consists in the implementation of a feed-in tariff (FiT), currently unavailable in Mexico for residential users. The FiT could be funded from the avoided generation cost in conventional plants plus the corresponding savings from self-generation of electricity. Alternatively, the option of funding the FiT from small increases in electricity prices to all customers was also explored.

This particular case includes measuring sensors and obstacle lights on a meteorological mast for wind measurements requiring an uninterrupted power supply in cold climate conditions. Although these low-power (100 W) measuring sensors and obstacle lights use little energy, their energy consumption is not the same as the available solar energy obtained on a daily or seasonal basis. In the paper, complementarity of renewable energy sources was analysed, as well as one of short-term lead-acid batterybased storage and seasonal, hydrogen-based (electrolyser, H2 tank, and fuel cells) storage. These relatively complex power systems were proposed earlier for high-power consumers only, while this study specifically highlights the role of the hydrogen system for supplying low-power consumers. The analysis employed a numerical simulation method using the HOMER software tool. The results of the analysis suggest that solar and wind-solar systems, which involve meteorological conditions as referred to in this paper, include a relatively large number of leadacid batteries. Additionally, the analysis suggests that the use of hydrogen power systems for supplying low power-consumers is entirely justifiable, as it significantly reduces the number of batteries (two at minimum in this particular case). It was shown that the increase in costs induced by the hydrogen system is acceptable.","Energy storage; Homer software; Meteorological mast; Photo-voltaic-wind-hydrogen hybrid system; Proton exchange membrane fuel cell; Stand-alone power system",,"Bakić, V.V.; Laboratory for Thermal Engineering and Energy, Vinca Institute of Nuclear Sciences, University of BelgradeSerbia; email: bakicv@vinca.rs",,"Serbian Society of Heat Transfer Engineers",03549836,,,,"English","Therm.

Although Taiwan's government invested vast resources to develop nuclear energy in the past decades, the construction work of new nuclear plant cannot continue but was asked to be stopped and the plants sealed, after the public faced the nuclear disaster caused by the Fukushima nuclear power plant in Japan in 2011. People are paying increasing attention to concerns about nuclear safety and environmental jeopardy. A movement asking for a nuclearfree homeland has sprung up. In recent years, woody bioenergy has been rapidly developed as a renewable form of energy in advanced Western countries, and the development has not only increased annually, but there are targeted goals for the medium and long term in their future energy policies. By analyzing the current domestic status of various renewable energy utilizations, the objectives of this study were to assess the feasibility of developing woody bioenergy in Taiwan and make policy recommendations to the related energy authorities. Research results showed that the cost of power generated by woody bioenergy was around New Taiwan (NT) $2.24∼2.7 kWh-1 (EUR$1≈NT$38.04), which was less than fossil fuels at NT$5.99 kWh-1 and natural gas at NT$3.25 kWh-1. In regions where conventional hydropower, wind power, and solar photovoltaic cannot effectively be supplied, there are mass distributions of woody bioenergy throughout the island. Based on existing data, which were collected on materials of thinning of plantations and residues of wood processing, woody bioenergy was estimated to substitute for around 2.5∼5.9% of power generation capacity each year of a new nuclear power plant, if these materials were properly distributed and managed. This alternative could upgrade energy diversification, improve power shortages due to the closing of nuclear power plants, and grasp the opportunities for a low-carbon energy economy.","Electricity generation from fuel; Renewable energy; Woody energy","Carbon; Energy resources; Fossil fuels; Nuclear energy; Nuclear fuels; Nuclear power plants; Solar power generation; Wind power; Electricity generation; Energy diversification; Feasibility analysis; Low carbon energies; Policy recommendations; Power generation capacities; Renewable energies; Woody energy; Plant shutdowns","Pan, W.-R.; Division of Forest Utilization, Taiwan Forestry Research Institute, 53 Nanhai Rd., Taiwan; email: tt11031209@gmail.com",,"Taiwan Forestry Research Institute",10264469,,TLKEF,,"Chinese","Taiwan J.

This study examines the benefits of solar and wind energy on a community scale on the island of New Providence in The Bahamas and helps understand key factors that affect the implementation of hybrid renewable energy systems in an island community. The electricity usage of 500 homes (a mix of luxury and normal) is produced by a combined power generation system that includes rooftop photovoltaics and a wind turbine. The system is grid connected and assumes a net billing policy because of the lack of a net metering policy and incentives. For the study, an economic analysis along with sensitivity and risk analyses are performed to determine the system's feasibility and how its viability is affected by the uncertainty in its parameters. To perform the analysis, the RETScreen software suite is used. It is found that a combination of solar and wind for electricity generation is economically feasible in The Bahamas, even with the lack of incentives, where the net present value is within the range of US$14.0 million to US$25.1 million with a 95% confidence. Additionally, it is seen that current fuel costs and the initial cost of the sy stem play key roles in the degree to which the system is feasible.","Bahamas; Energy; Hybrid; Renewable; Solar; Wind",,"Bingham, R.D.; Faculty of Engineering and Applied Science, University of Ontario Institute of TechnologyCanada; email: raymond.bingham@uoit.ca",,"International Journal of Renewable Energy Research",13090127,,,,"English","Int.

The use of SWH systems is motivated by the desire to reduce energy consumption and especially to reduce a major source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The purposes of the present paper consist in: assessing the solar potential; analysing the possibility of using solar energy to heat water for residential applications in Romania; investigating the economic potential of SWH systems; and their contribution to saving energy and reducing CO2 emissions. The results showed that if solar systems are used, the annual energy savings amount to approximately 71%, and the reduction of GHG emissions into the atmosphere are of 18.5 tonnes of CO2 over the lifespan of the system, with a discounted payback period of 6.8-8.6 years, in accordance with the savings achieved depending on system characteristics, the solar radiation available, ambient air temperature and on heating load characteristics. Financially, the installation of SWH systems determines net savings of 805-1151 Euro in a 25-year period in the absence of governmental subsidies. According to the sensitivity analysis, installing a SWH system with subsidies of up to 50% determines the reduction of the discounted payback period to 3.1-3.9 years and the increase of net savings to 1570-1916 Euro. These results indicate that investing in these systems is cost-effective for Romanian households as long as the governmental subsidies increase. © 2016 by the author.","Economic analysis; Energy savings; Environmental analysis; GHG emissions; Governmental subsidies; Sensitivity analysis; Solar energy; Solar fraction; Solar water heating","economic analysis; emission; energy conservation; energy use; environmental assessment; greenhouse gas; heating; household survey; installation; photovoltaic system; sensitivity analysis; solar power; solar radiation; subsidy system; Romania","Paraschiv, S.; Faculty of Engineering, Dunarea de Jos University of Galati, 47 Domneasca Street, Romania; email: sparaschiv@ugal.ro",,"MDPI AG",20711050,,,,"English","Sustainability",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85007376414

However, the response to the government's feed-in tariff support for residential rooftop solar has been slow. Among many reasons, this paper argues that the lack of feasibility of residential rooftop solar power investment remains a key barrier.

This paper operationalises a sociotechnical transitions perspective to analyse for the first time the potential of new, mobileenabled, pay-as-you-go approaches to financing sustainable energy access, focussing on a case study of pay-as-you-go approaches to financing solar home systems in Kenya. The analysis calls into question the adequacy of the dominant, two-dimensional treatment of sustainable energy access in the literature as a purely financial/technology, economics/ engineering problem (which ignores sociocultural and political considerations) and demonstrates the value of a new research agenda that explicitly attends to theories of social change – even when, as in this paper, the focus is purely on finance. The paper demonstrates that sociocultural considerations cut across the literature's traditional two-dimensional analytic categories (technology and finance) and are material to the likely success of any technological or financial intervention. It also demonstrates that the alignment of new payas- you-go finance approaches with existing sociocultural practices of paying for energy can explain their early success and likely longevity relative to traditional finance approaches. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.","finance; Kenya; socio-technical transitions; solar PV; sustainable energy access","cultural tradition; energy policy; energy use; finance; photovoltaic system; social change; solar power; sustainability; technological development; United Nations; Kenya",,,"SAGE Publications Ltd",0308518X,,,,"English","Environ.

Moreover, as renewable energy sources are deployed in home, a home energy management system needs to consider both energy consumption and generation simultaneously to minimize the energy cost. In this paper, a smart home energy management model has been presented in which electrical and thermal appliances are jointly scheduled. The proposed method aims at minimizing the electricity cost of a residential customer by scheduling various type of appliances considering the residents consumption behavior, seasonal probability, social random factor, discomfort index and appliances starting probability functions. In this model, the home central controller receives the electricity price information, environmental factors data as well as the resident desired options in order to optimally schedule appliances including electrical and thermal. The scheduling approach is tested on a typical home including variety of home appliances, a small wind turbine, photovoltaic panel, combined heat and power unit, boiler and electrical and thermal storages over a 24-h period. The results show that the scheduling of different appliances can be reached simultaneously by using the proposed formulation. Moreover, simulation results evidenced that the proposed home energy management model exhibits a lower cost and, therefore, is more economical. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

This is due to guaranteed feed-in tariffs in conjunction with decreasing prices for solar panels. However, little is known on geographical factors, settlement structure, neighborhood effects or the crucial role of middle actors for the spatial distribution of photovoltaics. The presented study addresses these issues by accounting for more than 820,000 small-scale installations (≤16 kWp) registered between 1991 and 2012. It turns out that the installed capacity (and generated supply) from small-scale installations clearly varies among German counties. Based on econometric analysis, this can partly be explained by differences in solar radiation. However, other factors, such as house density, homeownership, per-capita income and neighborhood effects seem to be equally or even more important. In contrast, households' ecological attitude hardly affects the investment decisions. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The purpose of this study is to prevent the fluctuations of the PV output power connected to the DC smart house from flowing into the power system. This paper proposes compensation methods for fluctuations in the output power of the PV as well as those caused by consumption power of uncontrollable loads. The proposed scheme achieves a stable constant active power interconnection point between the smart house and the grid by cooperative operation of Electric Vehicle (EV) and Electric Water Heater (EWH). The control scheme of both the EV and the EWH uses the H∞ control method. H∞ control improves the control performance because the gain can be regulated according to the frequency domain. The proposed scheme is tested by comparing with two other cases, of which the control group comprises no-controller for each device and Proportional-Integral (PI) controllers for each device. In the no-control scenario, these devices follow a randomly generated load profile. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by simulation results in the MATLAB/Simulink® environment. © 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.",,"Controllers; Domestic appliances; Economics; Electric power transmission networks; Electric vehicles; Frequency domain analysis; Heating; Houses; MATLAB; Power control; Two term control systems; Water heaters; Active power control; Compensation method; Control performance; Controllable loads; Cooperative operation; Electric water heaters; Proportional integral controllers; Residential photovoltaic; Electric machine control",,,"American Institute of Physics Inc.",19417012,,,,"English","J.

This multi-objective optimization problem requires the advancement of a dynamic multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm that maximizes the renewable energy ratio of buildings and minimizes total net present cost and CO2 emission for required system changes. Three proven performance metrics evaluate the quality of the Pareto front generated by the proposed approach. The obtained results are compared against two reported multi-objective optimization algorithms in the related literature. Finally, an existing residential apartment located in a cold Canadian climate provides a test case to apply the proposed model and optimally size a hybrid renewable energy system. In this test application, the model investigates the potential use of a heat pump, a biomass boiler, wind turbines, solar heat collectors, photovoltaic panels, and a heat storage tank to produce renewable energy for the building. Furthermore, the utilization of plug-in electric vehicles for transportation reduces gasoline use where all power is generated by the building, and the utility provides the means to match intermittent renewable generation from solar and wind to the building electrical loads. Model results show that under the chosen meteorological conditions and building parameters a wind turbine, and plug-in electric vehicle technologies are consistently the optimal option to achieve a target renewable energy ratio. In particular, the optimization result shows that the renewable energy ratio can achieve near 100% by installing a 73kW wind turbine, a 200kW biomass boiler, and using plug-in electric vehicles. This option has a net present cost of C$705,180 and results in total CO2 emission of 2.4ton/year. Finally, a sensitivity analysis is performed to investigate the impact of economic constants on net present cost of the obtained non-dominated solutions. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Hybrid renewable energy; Near zero energy building; Pareto front; Simulation-based optimization","Algorithms; Boilers; Buildings; Carbon dioxide; Climate models; Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Crashworthiness; Heat pump systems; Heat storage; Heuristic methods; Housing; Multiobjective optimization; Optimization; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Photovoltaic cells; Plug-in hybrid vehicles; Quality control; Renewable energy resources; Sensitivity analysis; Solar power generation; Vehicles; Wind turbines; Hybrid renewable energies; Hybrid renewable energy systems; Multi-objective optimization problem; Multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithms; Pareto front; Plug-in Electric Vehicles; Simulation-based optimizations; Zero energy building (ZEB); Structural design; algorithm; building; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; cost-benefit analysis; design; electronic equipment; energy resource; optimization; performance assessment; power generation; pump; renewable resource; residential energy; sensitivity analysis; solar power; wind turbine; Canada","ElMekkawy, T.Y.; Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, Qatar UniversityQatar",,"Elsevier Ltd",09601481,,,,"English","Renew.

While our empirical analysis demonstrates that such investments also incur substantial risks, there is evidence that, above all, wealthy households tend to benefit from the solar subsidies, whereas the costs of financing these subsidies are borne by electricity consumers at large, not least poverty-endangered households.

This paper presents a comprehensive study on the techno-economic performance of a stand-alone hybrid photovoltaic (PV)-wind-battery system for an office building located in Tehran, Iran. The Hybrid Optimization Model for Electric Renewables model was used to investigate the optimal design options and the techno-economic viability of the hybrid renewable energy system installed in that building. The proposed hybrid system based on renewable resources was designed to electrify the restrooms of the building. An optimal system configuration was chosen based on the total net present cost (NPC) and cost of energy (COE). The simulation results demonstrated that the optimum structure for the hybrid system for the primary load demand of 5.6 kW h per day, consists of 3 kW PV modules, 1 kW wind turbine, 1 kW inverter, and sixteen 200 A h batteries. The total NPC of such a system was estimated to be 21 132, while the COE was 1.543 per kW h. In addition, the proposed hybrid energy system could provide 2733 kW h additional electricity to the office building. Furthermore, in the last part of this research, a sensitivity analysis for different parameters such as primary load, wind speed, global solar radiation, interest rate, total NPC, cost of electricity, number of batteries and total electrical production was performed to demonstrate and elaborate the effect of each decision variable on the configuration of the optimum hybrid system. It became clear that two hybrid system configurations, i.e., PV-Wind-Battery and PV-Battery systems, are suggested as the most economical and feasible alternatives and have wide range of usage for different load demand values. Additionally based on the change in the initial design parameters such as wind speed, global solar radiation, load demand, and the real interest rate, a comparison between these two hybrid systems in terms of the total NPC, COE, electrical production, excess electricity, and grid extension distance has been made to investigate the effect of each decision variable on the optimal combination and the techno-economic viability of the hybrid renewable energy system. ï¿½ 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.",,"Architectural design; Buildings; Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Decision making; Electric batteries; Electric power transmission networks; Hybrid systems; Office buildings; Optimal systems; Optimization; Photovoltaic cells; Renewable energy resources; Sensitivity analysis; Solar radiation; Structural optimization; Wind; Wind turbines; Cost of electricity; Feasible alternatives; Global solar radiation; Hybrid energy system; Hybrid optimization model for electric renewables; Hybrid renewable energy systems; Optimal system configuration; Wind-battery systems; Structural design","Ataei, A.; Department of Energy Engineering, Graduate School of the Environment and Energy, Science and Research Branch, Islamic Azad UniversityIran; email: a.ataei@srbiau.ac.",,"American Institute of Physics Inc.",19417012,,,,"English","J.

The present paper has investigated the performance of hybrid PV-Wind-Diesel-Battery configuration based on hourly measurements of Adrar climate (southern Algeria). Data of global solar radiation, ambient temperature and wind speed for a period of one year have been used. Firstly, the proposed hybrid system has been optimized by means of HOMER software. The optimization process has been carried out taking into account renewable resources potential and energy demand; while maximizing renewable electricity use and fuel saving are the purpose. In the second step, a mathematical model has been developed to ensure efficient energy management on the basis of various operation strategies. The analysis has shown that renewable energy system (PV-Wind) is able to supply about 70% of the demand. Wind power has ranked first with 43% of the annual total electricity production followed by diesel generator (with 31%) while the remaining fraction is being to PV panels.

A PV-battery backup system is modeled and assessed as a replacement of the utility energy during daily power outage periods in a residential house. This paper focuses on the sizing of the PV system. The main objective is the minimization of the overall cost of the system over a 20 year period. One prime innovation in this study is that this system operates in conjunction with the grid, allowing it to charge the battery bank along with the PV panels whenever needed. Therefore, the optimization procedure takes into account more severe conditions compared to a classic standalone PV-battery system. The optimization is conducted based on real weather data, realistic residential load profiles and power outage schedules. Technical constraints are integrated in the algorithm. Two robust optimization techniques are used for comparison and validation purposes: the Genetic Algorithm and the Particle Swarm Optimization. In addition, two different situations are considered: harsh and moderate conditions.

In addition, the costs of electrical storage have also declined enough to make PV + battery systems potentially economically viable for a mass-scale off-grid low-emission transition. However, many regions in the U.S. (e.g. Northern areas) cannot have off-grid PV systems without prohibitively large battery systems. Small-scale combined heat and power (CHP) systems provide a potential solution for off-grid power backup of residential-scale PV + battery arrays, while also minimizing emissions from conventional sources. Thus, an opportunity is now available to maximize the use of solar energy and gain the improved efficiencies possible with CHPs to deploy PV + battery + CHP systems throughout the U.S. The aim of this study is to determine the technical viability of such systems by simulating PV + battery + CHP hybrid systems deployed in three representative regions in the U.S., using the Hybrid Optimization Model for Electric Renewable (HOMER) Pro Microgrid Analysis tool. The results show that the electricity generated by each component of the hybrid system can be coupled to fulfill the residential load demand. A sensitivity analysis of these hybrid off grid systems is carried out as a function capacity factor of both the PV and CHP units. The results show that conservatively sized systems are technically viable in any continental American climate and the details are discussed to provide guidance for both design and deployment of PV + battery + CHP hybrid systems to reduce consumer costs, while reducing energy- and electricity-related emissions. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Cogeneration; Combined heat and power; HOMER; Hybrid system; Photovoltaic; Sizing","Cogeneration plants; Cost reduction; Costs; Electric batteries; Housing; Hybrid systems; Optimization; Sensitivity analysis; Solar concentrators; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Cogeneration; Combined heat and power; HOMER; Photovoltaic; Sizing; Electric power transmission networks","Pearce, J.M.; 601 M and M Building, 1400 Townsend Drive, United States",,"Elsevier Ltd",01968904,,ECMAD,,"English","Energy Convers.

To address these issues, in this paper we present a theoretically-based and empirically-driven agent-based model of technology adoption, with an application to residential solar photovoltaic (PV). Using household-level resolution for demographic, attitudinal, social network, and environmental variables, the integrated ABM framework we develop is applied to real-world data covering 2004-2013 for a residential solar PV program at the city scale.

Our goal is to identify features of the model that are most critical to successful prediction of the temporal, spatial, and demographic patterns that characterize the technology adoption process for solar PV. Agent variables, topology, and environment are derived from detailed and comprehensive real-world data between 2004 and 2013 in Austin (Texas, USA). Four variations of the model are developed, each with a different level of complexity and empirical characterization.

However, these technologies have been found to have a significant impact on distribution networks in terms of secondary distribution transformer overloading and increased reverse power flow. Energy storage systems (ESSs) are thought to be an effective tool for mitigating these negative effects. The primary challenge in implementing ESS technology lies in the difficulty of determining the appropriate sizes and operating schedules for these units, given the uncertainties inherent in PV array production and PHEV demand. This paper presents a probabilistic sizing and scheduling methodology for ESSs to facilitate the integration of PHEVs and PV arrays in distribution networks, taking into account different sources of uncertainty present in the system. The technical and economic feasibility of the proposed design methodology has been validated using Monte Carlo (MC) simulations for a variety of scenarios. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This study uses Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) to compare the environmental impacts of a diesel/PV/wind hybrid microgrid on the island of Koh Jig, Thailand with the electrification alternatives of grid extension and home diesel generators. The impact categories evaluated are: acidification potential (kg SO2 eq), global warming potential (kg CO2 eq), human toxicity potential (kg 1.4 DCB eq), and abiotic resource depletion potential (kg Sb eq). The results show that the microgrid system has the lowest global warming and abiotic resource depletion potentials of all three electrification scenarios. The use phase of the diesel generator and the extraction of copper are shown to significantly contribute to the microgrid's environmental impacts. The relative environmental impacts of the grid extension scenario are found to be proportional to the distance required for grid extension. Across all categories except acidification potential, the impacts from the home diesel generators are the largest. Sensitivity analyses show that maximizing the renewable energy fraction does not necessarily produce a more environmentally sustainable electrification scenario and that the diesel generator provides versatility to the system by allowing power production to be scaled significantly before more technology is needed to meet demand. While the environmental benefits of the microgrid increase as the installation community becomes more isolated, the choice of electrification scenario requires assigning relative importance to each impact category and considering social and economic factors. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","ADP; AP; CML-IA; Diesel electricity generation; GWP; HTP; Hybrid microgrid system; KMUTT; Life Cycle Assessment; Power grid extension; Renewable energy; Rural electrification development","Acidification; Administrative data processing; Carbon dioxide; Electric power distribution; Electric power generation; Electric utilities; Global warming; Jigs; Life cycle; Natural resources; Rural areas; Sensitivity analysis; Sulfur dioxide; AP; Electricity generation; GWP; HTP; KMUTT; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Micro-grid systems; Power grids; Renewable energies; Rural electrification; Environmental impact; carbon dioxide; electricity generation; environmental impact; global warming; installation; life cycle analysis; oxide; photovoltaic system; renewable resource; resource depletion; rural area; socioeconomic status; Thailand","Young, A.11415 James Jack Lane, United States",,"Elsevier Ltd",09601481,,,,"English","Renew.

This work addresses the optimal operation of a combined bioenergy and solar PV distributed energy generation system to meet the electricity and heat demands of an eco-community comprising a palm oil mill and its surrounding residential community. A multiperiod mixed-integer linear programming planning and scheduling model is formulated on an hourly basis that optimally selects the power generation mix from among available biomass, biogas, and solar energy resources with consideration for energy storage and load shifting. A multiscenario approach is employed that considers scenarios in the form of many possible weather conditions and various energy profiles under varying mill operation modes and residential electricity consumption. The proposed approach is demonstrated on a realistic case study for a palm oil mill in the Iskandar Malaysia economic development region. The computational results indicate that biomass-based resource is the preferred renewable energy to be implemented due to the high cost associated with solar PV.

Very little work has been done earlier into the effects of integrating water desalination alongside meeting load demand. Moreover, the impact of intelligent techniques, in this context, against more established software tools has not been applied. In this paper, PSO (Particle Swarm Optimisation) is compared to HOMER for the simultaneous optimisation of size and PMS (Power Management Strategy) in stand-alone hybrid energy systems. These systems incorporate significant relative water load met by reverse osmosis. Multi-objective functions in PSO minimise Total NPC (Net Present Cost) (includes capital, maintenance and replacement costs over a 25 year system lifetime) and lifetime CO2 emissions whilst meeting these two loads. Results are analysed and compared for the conditions of dynamic (15 min resolved) versus static water demand in addition to meeting varying electric loads. The PSO algorithm is implemented using MATLAB/Simulink and compared to a similar overall configuration developed in HOMER to meet the same loads (electric, water).Results show using PSO achieves systems having lower NPC compared to HOMER, with the margin of improvement more pronounced in greater scale systems as water storage capacity and electrical load increase.

A PV system located in Southern Italy will be the subject of this assessment. Design/methodology/approach - The paper presents the case of a 1 MW ground-mounted PV system. The data regarding solar radiation on the surface of the modules and the relative solar diagrams were simulated and reported using PVSYST® 5.21 software.Toevaluate the profitability and solvency of the project, anumberof factors were taken into consideration: profitability indicators of net present value and internal rateofreturn,thedebtservicecoverageindicatorsofdebtservicecoverratioandloanlifecoverratioandtheirmean annual values (annual debt service cover ratio and annual loan life cover ratio, respectively).Asensitivity analysis with respect to the most critical element (weighted average cost of capital) gave strength to the results. Findings - The achievement of grid parity for 200kWPV systems is happening globally in areas with higher irradiation, but it clearly refers to residential utilities and is not applicable to large systems. The case study considers a power plant (= 1 MW) to assess the total cost that it would need to have to be economically advantageous. Research limitations/implications - This is an assessment made using a case which, given an average irradiance value in the area and the energy produced, can be used in all countries lying in the temperate zone. For other areas, a scaling coefficient would be needed. Practical implications - The paper is useful for understanding the order of cost, which must catch up to PV technology to make investments in power plants profitable in the absence of government incentives. It is also helpful for those who make government policies so that these may propose possible incentives commensurate with the actual difference between the value of the technology and the value of the investment. The study is also useful for a possible comparison with a system sharing the same characteristics (size, energy production) for off-grid use and customers. Originality/value - The study can be a valuable support for government policies to incentivate PV systems that contribute to a reduction of greenhouse gases and that help contain climate change. The case study represents a real case taken directly from a real project.

We designed and managed these systems optimally and highlighted configurations that promote self-consumption of energy. In addition, the negative impact on the grid of local power generation (related to both energy injection and extraction) is minimized. The combination of photovoltaic solar panels and a vertical-axis wind turbine as a viable energy mix option for residential buildings in Southern France has also been evaluated.

Finding alternatives to the current grid-tied electricity supply in the country is a prodigious concern to the South African economy due to historic unreliability. The national power grid and the South African economy can extensively benefit from utilizing solar energy as an abundant clean and renewable energy source. This paper considers and further investigates power generation utilising a novel approach to transparent solar façades (windows). Harvesting solar energy is consequently included in the building envelope, which improves building efficiency while reducing demand on the national electric grid. The impacts, design, modelling and results of this novel approach to Photo Voltaic (PV) systems, is further examined in this paper. These systems are aimed to be used in the commercial and residential market. Factoring in the location, design and installation of the solar façade, geographical conditions relevant to South Africa were used to evaluate the transparent façade’s performance. The generated power from a façade depends on solar irradiation, orientation, (Azimuth and Zenith angles); climate conditions such as temperature and rainfall; and other solar constraints.

The load sharing approach is investigated using dynamic simulations in comparison to a base case with separate conventional systems. Once the advantage of load sharing approach was demonstrated, the performance of two different hybrid systems in load sharing scenario were analyzed. The first one consists of a ground source heat pump (GSHP) and a fuel cell (FC); while the second one is based on a GSHP and a photovoltaic thermal (PVT) system. The performance of these two systems were also compared to a stand-alone GSHP system in order to analyze the advantages of hybrid systems to a single GSHP system. The energy analysis results show that in a load sharing case while using conventional technologies the primary energy savings are equal to 2.1% with respect to the reference case. The introduction of hybrid microcogeneration systems in load sharing application led to primary energy saving with respect to the reference case of 12.8% for the GSHP-FC system and 53.1% for the GSHP-PVT system. The environmental analysis shows a reduction of CO2 equivalent emissions equal to 15.8% and 52.0% for GSHP-FC and GSHP-PVT respectively. The better energy and environmental performance of GSHP-PVT system is due to the introduction of a significant amount of renewable energy source. The economic analysis focusses on operational cost and Simple Pay Back (SPB) index of the different cases and it is also based on an accurate study of the natural gas and electricity tariffs in Italy. This analysis highlights the advantages of the load sharing approach, because in some cases it allows the reduction of both the investment cost and the operational cost. The economic analysis for the two hybrid systems shows an operational costs reduction equal to 28.0% for GSHP-FC and 56.4% for GSHP-PVT in comparison to the reference case. In presence of economic support mechanisms, the SPB could also reach interesting values, either for the energy efficiency or for the introduction of systems based on renewable energy source. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.","Cogeneration; Dynamic simulation; Hybrid energy systems; Load sharing","Carbon dioxide; Computer simulation; Cost benefit analysis; Cost reduction; Costs; Economic analysis; Energy conservation; Energy efficiency; Environmental management; Fuel cells; Heat pump systems; Hybrid systems; Investments; Natural resources; Office buildings; Renewable energy resources; Cogeneration; Environmental and economic performance; Environmental performance; Groundsource heat pump (GSHP); Hybrid energy system; Load sharing; Microcogeneration system; Renewable energy source; Geothermal heat pumps","Canelli, M.; Università Degli Studi Del Sannio, Dipartimento di Ingegneria, Piazza Roma 21, Italy",,"Elsevier Ltd",13594311,,ATENF,,"English","Appl Therm Eng",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84921329189

Nevertheless, distributed photovoltaic generation does not compete for land use, as it is incorporated into existing buildings, and should be analyzed from the standpoint of the final consumer, who perceives electricity prices rather than electricity generation costs. This study evaluates the technical-economic potential for installing PV in the Brazilian residential sector. Socio-economic characteristics, such as household income, electric power consumption, availability of rooftops, load curve, capital cost and financing, were considered. Technical-economic simulation tools were integrated into a geographical information system ('GIS') to permit a spatial analysis. Results indicate technological feasibility for urban and rural areas of Brazilian municipalities. In 2014, about 1500 sites would be ready to install photovoltaic panels, and in 2016 this number would reach 68,000 homes. For the year 2026, about 29 million residential units would be prepared to have photovoltaic panels installed. Of these, 3% would be high-income residences, and 52% would be situated in the country's Southeast region.

To promote adoption in the future absence of this tariff, we explored further motives of homeowners relevant to PV system purchase intention. A sample of 200 homeowners who did not own a PV system participated in an online-survey. Only few homeowners actually planned to adopt a PV system. However, basic willingness to adopt a PV system was high, whereas willingness to pay was low - hinting at a potentially growing market with falling prices. Using path analysis, we show that the subjective norm (i.e. peer behavior and expectations) and the attitude towards PV were strong predictors of purchase intention. Attitude towards PV systems was mainly based on aspirations of social status, autarky, and financial gains, whereas costs, efforts, and risks associated with PV systems were detrimental to attitude. We conclude that to promote further adoption, energy storage systems that increase financial savings and autarky need to be improved and marketed. Furthermore, institutionalized tests of PV systems and labels need to be introduced to reduce risk perceptions among homeowners willing to adopt a PV system. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Acceptance; Autarky; Photovoltaic system; Purchase intention; Purchase motives","Acceptance; Autarky; Photovoltaic systems; Purchase intention; adoption behavior; homeowner; path analysis; photovoltaic system; savings; social status; tariff structure; willingness to pay; Germany","Korcaj, L.; Albert-Ludwigs-Universität Freiburg, Institute of Psychology, Engelbergerstraße 41, Germany",,"Elsevier Ltd",09601481,,,,"English","Renew.

In total 40 economically and technically feasible energy efficiency measures for a high performing single family house were analyzed. Special attention was devoted to the study of the building technical systems. Achieving a net zero balance required a high efficient system combined with high insulation and a large PV system, which plays a key role in the nearly and net zero building energy balance. Three net zero energy balance solutions, based on all electric systems, were presented. Net ZEB solutions allowed also the building carbon footprint to be reduced by 40% compared to the reference case study. Without proper financial subsides, net ZEB solutions are still far for being economic feasible, having a global cost 212-313 €/m2 higher than cost optimal solutions.

An electricity demand profile from new data collected in Ottawa, Canada is used to provide a full year energy use context for the analyses. The demands placed on the battery are examined to assess the suitability of the battery size and performance, as well as control related functionalities which reveal significantly varying battery use, and led to a quantitative expression for equivalent cycles. The energy use simulations are derived from electrochemical fundamentals adapted for a larger battery pack.

Despite the widely perceived economic and environmental benefits of rooftop PV, the economic and environmental performance of rooftop PV under Australian conditions are yet to be thoroughly examined. Whilst prior studies on the subject of rooftop PV are extensively overseas based, the conditions under which they are performed differ immensely from the Australian conditions. Consequently, this paper focuses on evaluating the life cycle economic and environmental merit of rooftop PV in Australia. By making use of component-wise costs and embedded emissions associated with each component of the rooftop PV generation system, the life cycle cost and emission models have been developed. For this to occur, the Australian costs and, energy and emission intensities have been used. All the life cycle factors relating to the manufacturing, purchasing, installation and operation of rooftop PV are considered. A sensitivity analysis is performed with respect to electricity price, feed-in tariff, battery price, battery lifetime and emission intensities. The results of the cost and emissions analyses are collectively used to estimate the cost of emissions mitigation through the use of rooftop PV for current and potential future scenarios in Australia. The cost payback and the energy payback times are found to range between 11 to more than 25. years and 1.75 to 14. years, respectively. The study also reveals that local load profile can have a significant impact on payback times.

The development of grid relieving management strategies for the storage system in due consideration of self-consumption is a necessary step forward in order to analyze the potential of private home battery storage systems to reduce stress on the power supply system. A MATLAB-based model of a lithium-ion storage system has been developed. The model is applicable for a wide range of PV generator sizes, different battery storage systems and diverse management strategies. In order to identify the potential of grid relieving forecast strategies, without discharging the storage into the grid, a management strategy based on persistence forecasts of solar radiation and household load demand has been implemented and analyzed. To minimize forecast uncertainties a proportional plus integral controller has been developed. The persistence forecast management strategy is applicable in real-life PV-battery-systems and due to the simple forecast it is easy to equip existing systems with such a management system with only low effort. As a result it will be shown that a storage system management based on forecasts has a significantly higher potential to relieve the grid than a system that only maximizes self-consumption as it is usually used nowadays. Besides, such a management strategy is able to unload the grid more than a static power reduction to 70% of the nominal power rating according to the current German Renewable Energy Sources Act (EEG). At the same time, the self-consumption can be retained at nearly the same level as by using a management strategy to purely maximize the self-consumption. Even less energy is wasted then with the feed-in limitation. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Battery management strategy; Battery modeling; Home storage system; Photovoltaic (PV); Power supply system","Battery management systems; Electric batteries; Electric power distribution; Electric power systems; Forecasting; Lithium alloys; Photovoltaic effects; Renewable energy resources; Sun; Battery Management; Battery modeling; Battery storage system; Photovoltaic; Proportional-plus-integral controllers; Renewable energy source; Static power reduction; Storage systems; Storage management; cost-benefit analysis; future prospect; photovoltaic system; solar radiation","Moshövel, J.; Institute for Power Electronics and Electrical Drives (ISEA), Jaegerstrasse 17/19, Germany",,"Elsevier Ltd",03062619,,APEND,,"English","Appl.

Despite generous financial incentives the adoption rate is low. We use the option value framework, which takes into account the benefit of delaying investment in response to uncertainty, to examine the decision by households to invest in solar PV. Using a simulation model, we determine optimal adoption times, critical values of discounted benefits, and adoption rates over time for solar PV investments using data from Massachusetts. We find that the option value multiplier is 1.6, which implies that the discounted value of benefits from solar PV needs to exceed installation cost by 60% for investment to occur. Without any policies, median adoption time is eight years longer under the option value decision rule compared to the net present value decision rule where households equate discounted benefits to installation cost. Rebates and other financial incentives decrease adoption time, but their effect is attenuated if households apply the option value decision rule to solar PV investments. Results suggest that policies that reduce the uncertainty in returns from solar PV investments would be most effective at incentivizing adoption. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Investment under uncertainty; Solar incentive policies; Solar PV","Solar energy; Solar power generation; Financial incentives; Incentive policies; Installation costs; Investment under uncertainty; Renewable energies; Renewable energy incentives; Solar photovoltaics; Solar PVs; Investments; alternative energy; energy policy; investment; photovoltaic system; renewable resource; residential location; solar power; Massachusetts; United States","Crago, C.L.; Department of Resource Economics, University of Massachusetts Amherst, Stockbridge Hall, 80 Campus Center Way, United States",,"Elsevier Ltd",03014215,,ENPYA,,"English","Energy Policy",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84943606198

Household electricity consumption and EV home-charging are modeled with a Markov-chain model.

This was done by calculating the payback time for various sizes of newly installed PV systems for a Finnish detached house with district heating. Three types of economic support schemes (guaranteed selling price, fixed premiums and self-consumption incentives) were tested in an hourly simulation. The load of the building was based on real-life measurements, while PV output was simulated with TRNSYS software. The energy results were post-processed with economic data in MATLAB to find the payback time. Hourly electricity prices from the Nordic energy market were used with PV system prices from Finnish companies.Unsubsidised residential PV systems in Finland had payback times of more than 40 years. The production-based support for PV generation needs to be two to three times the buying price of electricity, to make it possible to pay back the initial investment in 20 years. Low capacity systems with more than 50% self-consumption (under 3. kW) were favoured by self-consumption incentives, while high capacity systems with less than 40% self-consumption (over 5. kW) were favoured by the FIT-type support schemes. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Feed-in tariff; Finland; On-site energy matching; Payback time; Photovoltaic system; Renewable energy support","Costs; Heating; Housing; MATLAB; Photovoltaic cells; Power markets; Solar power generation; Feed-in tariff; Finland; On-site energy; Payback time; Photovoltaic systems; Renewable energies; Investments; alternative energy; energy market; photovoltaic system; price dynamics; renewable resource; solar power; tariff structure; Finland","Hirvonen, J.; Aalto University School of Engineering, Department of Energy Technology, P.O.

TPO firms sign long-term agreements with building owners or users to install, finance and manage locally sited solar panels. Customers simply buy solar electricity. The business model can increase total PV market demand by removing central barriers to PV adoption including technology risk, financing needs, and learning costs. TPO is now the dominant US model for residential solar and attempts to use the business model are underway in Europe and Asia.This study discusses how policy makers can enable emergence of solar TPO business models in new markets, a theme novel to extant literature. The paper is based on a comprehensive study of the US solar TPO ecosystem including 50 interviews with key market actors.A downside to the TPO model is potential lock-out of innovative solar technology.

The model is built with a ""bottom-up"" approach and the basic block is the single appliance. Using as inputs patterns of active occupancy and typical domestic habits, the fuzzy model give as output the likelihood to start each appliance within the next minute.

In particular, we compare the use of absolute and relative mitigation costs to evaluate the attractiveness of these projects under the CDM. We encourage the use of relative mitigation costs, implying consideration of baseline costs that render the projects profitable. Results of the mitigation cost analysis are dependent on the baseline chosen.

Uncertainties in wind power generation and energy consumption are described in the form of Prediction Intervals (PIs), estimated by a Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) - trained Neural Network (NN). The framework is tested and exemplified in a microgrid formed by a middle-size train station (TS) with integrated photovoltaic power production system (PV), an urban wind power plant (WPP) and a surrounding residential district (D). The system is described by Agent-Based Modelling (ABM): each stakeholder is modeled as an individual agent, which aims at a specific goal, either of decreasing its expenses from power purchasing or increasing its revenues from power selling. The aim of this paper is to identify which is the uncertainty level associated to the ""extreme"" conditions upon which robust management decisions perform better than a microgrid management based on expected values. This work shows how the probability of occurrence of some specific uncertain events, e.g., failures of electrical lines and electricity demand and price peaks, highly conditions the reliability and performance indicators of the microgrid under the two optimization approaches: (i) RO based on the PIs of the uncertain parameters and (ii) optimization based on expected values. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

This report introduces an economic model for the fuel cell, photovoltaic panels and wind turbine. Three sources of energy beside the local grid can respond to all variations of demand. Since sources of energy should change their productions according to the demand variations, we call it sources' response. The model consists of the cost of supplying energy, cost of recovered thermal energy from the fuel cell, wind turbine power production cost, solar power generation cost, cost of exchange power with the local grid and the cost of maintenance. Finally, it is trying to minimize total cost by the help of three different evolutionary planning methods.

The logic is illustrated with a case study based on the practical data of a building located in southern India. This building is associated with 3.4 MWh/day priority load (peak load as 422 kW), as well as 3.3 MWh/day deferrable load (peak load as 500 kW). Sensitivity analysis is performed to deal with uncertainties such as the increase in electricity consumption and grid tariff, environmental changes, etc. From the simulation result, it is observed that the designed system is cost effective and environment friendly, which leads to 6.18 % annual cost savings and reduces CO2 emissions by 38.3 %. Sensitivity results indicate that the system is optimal and adaptable in a certain range of unanticipated variances with respect to best estimated value.

The Energy Systems Model (ESM) is similar to the popular microgrid software HOMER, but improves upon the battery models used in that program. ESM adds several important aspects of battery modeling, including temperature effects, rate-based variable efficiency, and operational modeling of capacity fade and we demonstrate that addition of these factors can significantly alter optimal system design, levelized cost of electricity (LCOE), and other factors. ESM is then used to compare the Aqueous Hybrid Ion (AHI) battery chemistry to lead acid (PbA) batteries in standalone microgrids. The model suggests that AHI-based diesel generator/photovoltaic (PV)/battery systems are often more cost-effective than PbA-based systems by an average of around 10%, even though the capital cost of AHI technology is higher. The difference in LCOE is greatest in scenarios that have lower discount rates, increased PV utilization, higher temperature, and more expensive diesel fuel. AHI appears to be a better complement to solar PV, and scenarios that favor the use of solar PV (low PV prices, low discount rates, and high diesel prices) tend to improve the LCOE advantage of AHI. However, scenarios that do not require constant cycling of the batteries strongly favor PbA. AHI is not a drop-in replacement for PbA. To minimize LCOE, microgrids using AHI batteries should be designed and operated differently than PbA microgrids. © 2014 The Authors.

Recent studies have confirmed that they are not normally distributed over time. The increase in renewable energy installation has brought the issue of energy storage charge and discharge control. Thus, storage control methods that properly address non-normality are required. In this paper, we formulated the economically optimal storage control problem using Markov decision process (MDP) and the conditional value at risk (CVaR) measure to deal with the non-normality of predictive distribution about the household's net load. The CVaR measure was employed to treat with the chance constraint on the battery capacitor, in other words, overcharge risk and over-discharge risk. We conducted a simulation to compare the annual economic saving performances between two MDPs: one is the MDP with a Gaussian predictive distribution and the other is the MDP with a normalized frequency distribution (non-normal). We used the real time series of 35 residential energy consumption and PV generation data in Japan. The importance of addressing the non-normality of random variables was shown by our simulation. © 2015 by the authors.","Battery operation; Markov decision process (MDP); Renewable energy; Risk management","Digital storage; Energy utilization; Housing; Markov processes; Normal distribution; Photovoltaic cells; Risk management; Value engineering; Battery operation; Conditional Value-at-Risk; Markov Decision Processes; Predictive distributions; Renewable energies; Renewable energy installations; Residential energy consumption; Residential energy demand; Risk assessment","Yano, S.; Division of Advanced Information Technology and Computer Science, Tokyo University of Agriculture and TechnologyJapan; email: syano@cc.tuat.ac.jp",,"MDPI AG",19961073,,,,"English","Energies",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84946010824

In an attempt to overcome those barriers, a microgrid model was proposed and simulated. In the proposed microgrids, residential consumers are connected to each other to maximize the investment return by trading the surplus of generated energy among them. Different topologies and scenarios were studied from electrical energy and economic standpoints. Stochastic data of solar radiation were simulated for the city of Viçosa, Minas Gerais, Brazil, for the period of one year, considering the statistical behavior of a series over 20 years. The system output power and energy balance were calculated considering a model for photovoltaic generators and the radiation simulated data. By determining the generated energy and electrical needs of the microgrid members, the cash flow and economic feasibility were calculated. Sensitivity analyses were performed by varying economic parameters to determine situations where investment becomes feasible. This paper shows that microgrid contributes to improve the economics and the initial investments. The number of participants in a microgrid, the electricity and the equipment costs are important parameters to speed up the economic and technical feasibility process. © 2015 by the authors.","Distributed energy resources; Flexible generation; Photovoltaic feasibility","Commerce; Distributed power generation; Economics; Electric power distribution; Energy resources; Sensitivity analysis; Stochastic systems; Distributed Energy Resources; Economic feasibilities; Flexible generation; Government incentive; Minas Gerais , Brazil; Photovoltaic; Photovoltaic markets; Residential consumers; Investments","Filho, D.O.; Department of Agricultural Engineering, Universidade Federal de Vicosa, Av.

It applies an integrated methodology that identifies the demand in the off-grid village context using alternative scenarios. The techno-economic analysis of the optimal off-grid system architecture is then presented using HOMER software. Three energy resources are considered, namely solar energy, wind and diesel fuel. The optimal configuration suggested for the scenarios consists of diesel generators for the basic level of demand and PV-diesel hybrid for higher demand and reliable supply scenarios. The cost of electricity per kWh remains high for the basic level of supply and decreases as the system size increases. However, the capital and asset replacement costs increased considerably for bigger systems. The business case is then analysed for each scenario and it was found that it is practically impossible to reach grid price parity even with full capital cost subsidy, indicating significant amount of operating cost subsidy requirement that makes the larger systems financially unsustainable. Moreover, the small mini-grid system for the basic level of supply emerges as a cheaper option than providing the consumers with solar home systems. But the monthly electricity bill will become unaffordable for most consumers when demand restrictions are removed. Accordingly, the paper suggests a mini-grid based electricity supply to provide the basic level of provision alongside productive energy use during off-peak hours as the starting point. If the business develops and the demand improves, the system can be expanded subsequently using appropriate technology combinations. © 2014 The Author. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The paper aims to examine the financial viability of the notified scheme for residential consumers based on the current costs and applicable electricity tariff in Delhi, India. The self-owned and the third party owned models are evaluated for different SPV system sizes which are suitable for installation on residential rooftop spaces. The paper compares the Internal Rate of Return (IRR) based on cash flows for different cases using a deterministic financial model. Results indicate that with the current costs, smaller systems (2.5 and 5 kWp) are suitable for self ownership, but require the existing 30% subsidy in order to be financially viable. However, the return on larger self-owned systems (10 kWp and above) is sufficiently high and does not warrant the subsidy. On the other hand, third party ownership model is financially not feasible for smaller systems, but returns on larger systems (10 kWp and above) are sufficiently high. The paper while analyzing the IRR for various cases concludes that there are certain drawbacks in the scheme as it does not allow optimal utilization of rooftops for generation of electricity.

Increasing electricity production from renewable resources (e.g., photovoltaic systems and wind farms) is desirable but its unpredictability is a cause of problems for the main grid stability. A system with multiple energy sources represents an efficient solution, by realizing an interface among renewable energy sources, energy storage systems, and conventional power generators. Direct consequences of multi-energy systems are a wider energy flexibility and benefits for the electric grid, the purpose of this paper is to propose the best technology combination for electricity generation from a mix of renewable energy resources to satisfy the electrical needs. The paper identifies the optimal off-grid option and compares this with conventional grid extension, through the use of HOMER software. The solution obtained shows that a hybrid combination of renewable energy generators at an off-grid location can be a cost-effective alternative to grid extension and it is sustainable, techno-economically viable, and environmentally sound. The results show how this innovative energetic approach can provide a cost reduction in power supply and energy fees of 40% and 25%, respectively, and CO2 emission decrease attained around 18%.

Nonetheless, while the solar home system program with 3.6 million systems has gained worldwide recognition, there are considerable limitations in the usage of such systems, in particular in the ability to provide access to higher tier energy services for productive use. Minigrids, on the other hand, could provide this access but have yet to proof both scale and commercial viability. This paper provides critical insides into the case of Bangladesh for a cost-effective route to the SE4All goals by applying practical and resource-efficient minigrid design principles. Planning and operation techniques are elaborated on in detail and concluded with a financial analysis for a hybrid solar-PV-Diesel minigrid that provides enhanced energy access in particular for productive use. In addition, implications on the business model are highlighted for developing minigrids in off grid rural areas of Bangladesh for hybrid minigrids ranging from 100 to 250 kWp while exemplarily showing how the three goals of the United Nation Sustainable Energy for All Initiative can be pursued in a mutually beneficial way. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

One such ecosystem is the HyperCat consortium, a UK initiative, which is i developing ""spearhead"" applications with a Smart City/Smart Society theme broadly divided into four functional segments- manufacturing, transportation, utilities/energy, smart cities. In particular, HyperCat is seeking to provide an automated way for IoT clients to discover data they can understand in any IoT service. Applications in each of these segments turn dumb products into connected products with a shift in business model, from a product model jup-front capital expenditure) to a service model (ongoing operation expenditure). A closer examination of one segment, utilities/energy, illuminates the potential use of IoT and some of the challenges. The energy infrastructure is being reinvented up and down the supply chain in a once-a- century upheaval to address climate change in what has been a rather conservative industry. The old centralised command-and-control paradigm breaks down as generation becomes distributed and supply becomes increasingly non ""dispatchable"". Moixa Technology has developed Maslow, a grid-edge electricity storage solution - a 2kWh of battery storage, with an inverter, packaged into a box. Homes with photovoltaic panels typically only consume about 25% of the electricity they generate but Maslow, the value (in pure energy terms) of the panels to the home-owner can be doubled. Such systems also have value to the local distribution operator because they can effectively smooth the demand on the local cable distribution network. However this only works with connectivity. Each Maslow is a ""smart"" connected device enabling remote monitoring, control, management and maintenance. IoT applications will benefit if vendor silos are broken down in favour of horizontally integrated systems offering users more choice of provider and more competitive pricing and offering vendors more homogenous markets leading to economies of scale. A common theme is that the IoT enables better use of resources which drives benefits for all participants potentially creating a win-win dynamic which can pull the applications and inter-connectivity through to widespread adoption. There is no fundamental obstacle to IoT, but there are some thorny issues: Standards - There is a lack of interoperability driven by the multiplicity of technical standards. Naming - At the higher levels of the stack there is not a common way of naming - in order for one computer to exchange data with another, the two have to agree on common naming. Usability - The biggest challenge is perhaps usability - making IoT ""just work"" (and stay working!). As IoT devices become more numerous and more diverse, users cannot be expected to understand how to look after them. In addition to HyperCat, there are many initiatives addressing the above challenges in an open, agile fashion. These include: IP-to-the-edge - In the lower layers of the communications stack, the IP-to-the-edge trend continues. In the consumer domain, companies such as Google or Apple have sufficient might to drive millions of units unilaterally short-cutting the normal slow ecosystem boot-up process. Beacons - Apple launched iBeacon as a simple local Bluetooth-based beaconing system. Google is evolving this thinking by allowing beacons to emit URLs directly, and providing a mechanism for Web pages to send messages back to beacon. The trends driving the IoT make it inevitable, bringing both increasing power for good, but with increasing risk of complexity. Vertical silos are currently inhibiting IoT and are being addressed by standards-making and proactive ecosystem-creation.",,"Climate change; Command and control systems; Complex networks; Digital storage; Ecology; Economics; Ecosystems; Electric energy storage; Fruits; Photovoltaic cells; Standards; Supply chains; Websites; Cable distribution network; Capital expenditures; Command and control; Electricity storages; Energy infrastructures; Functional segments; Photovoltaic panels; Technical standards; Internet of things",,,"Institute of Telecommunications Professionals",17559278,,,,"English","J.

Such a way that in 2006, about 18% of the consumed energy of the world is obtained through renewable energies. Iran is among the countries that are geographically located in hot and dry areas and has the most sun exposure in different months of the year. Except in the coasts of Caspian Sea, the percentage of sunny days throughout the year is between 63 to 98 percent in Iran. On the other hand, there are dispersed and remote areas and loads far from national grid which is impossible to provide electrical energy for them through transmission from national grid, therefore, for such cases the renewable energy technologies could be used to solve the problem and provide the energy. In this paper, technical and economic feasibility for the use of renewable energies for independent systems of the grid for a dispersed load in the area on the outskirts of Isfahan (Sepahan) with the maximum energy consumption of 3Kwh in a day is studied and presented.

This research uses a best-worst scaling survey of microgeneration adopters, considerers and rejecters (n= 291) to determine the relative importance of different motivations and barriers in microgeneration (non) adoption decisions. The most important motivations are earning money from installation, increasing household energy independence and protecting against future high energy costs. Results indicate that the introduction of Feed-in Tariffs has clearly encouraged a new, more financially-motivated, group to install. Financial factors are the most important barriers and of most importance to rejecters is the prospect of losing money if they moved home. The Green Deal was introduced to reduce this barrier, but may instead exacerbate the problem as potential homebuyers are put off purchasing a home with an attached Green Deal debt. The difficulty in finding trustworthy information on microgeneration is also a major obstacle to adoption, particularly for considerers, despite efforts by the government and microgeneration interest groups to reduce this barrier. Self-sufficiency in energy is a more important motivation for those considering or having rejected installation than for adopters. Provision of accessible information and greater emphasis on household self-sufficiency in energy could help improve the uptake. © 2014 The Authors.","Barriers; Best-worst scaling; Feed-in tariffs; Microgeneration; Motivations; The Green Deal","Climate change; Heating; Barriers; Best-worst scaling; Feed-in tariff; Microgeneration; The Green Deal; Motivation; economic analysis; economic development; electricity generation; energy efficiency; energy policy; renewable resource; self sufficiency; United Kingdom","Rigby, D.; School of Social Sciences, The University of Manchester, Manchester M13 9PL, United Kingdom; email: dan.rigby@manchester.ac.uk",,"Elsevier Ltd",03062619,,APEND,,"English","Appl.

Livestock residues (dung) and solar radiation are two renewable energy resources that are abundantly available in rural areas of developing countries. Although it is not feasible for these two resources separately to meet both thermal (cooking) and electricity demands, hybrid applications have not been given due attention. To facilitate integrating these two resources in rural energy planning, and to promote their dissemination through hybrid applications, it is necessary to evaluate their economic merits, and assess their ability to deal with the demands. In this paper, we examine the techno-economic performance of hybrid applications of these two resources by applying a simulation technique using the HOMER tool, and by giving derived cost-saving equations. We also quantify the monetary savings from replacing traditional fuels, and perform a sensitivity analysis on a number of variables (e.g. dung cost, fuelwood cost) to see how they affect the performance of different energy supply alternatives. Furthermore, we examine the practical applicability of the biogas system in the households through a structured survey of 72 ongoing household biogas plants. This study finds that households that have between three and six cattle can potentially meet their cooking and electricity loads through a hybrid implementation of biogas and solar PV (Photovoltaic) system. By replacing conventional fuels households can achieve savings that are more than the total annualized costs incurred for installing new services. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Biogas engine; Monetary saving; Solar PV","Agriculture; Biogas; Costs; Developing countries; Economics; Energy resources; Renewable energy resources; Rural areas; Sensitivity analysis; Solar power generation; Sun; Biogas engines; Electricity demands; Hybrid implementation; Monetary savings; Rural energy planning; Simulation technique; Socio-economic development; Solar PVs; Cost benefit analysis; biogas; developing world; energy planning; energy resource; fuelwood; household energy; performance assessment; photovoltaic system; renewable resource; sensitivity analysis; simulation; socioeconomic status; solar cooker; solar radiation; Bos","Rahman, M.M.; Department of Energy Technology, Aalto University School of Engineering, FI-00076 Aalto, Finland; email: mdmizanur.rahman@aalto.fi",,,09601481,,,,"English","Renew.

This is applied to investigate the configuration and topologies of storage to solve voltage rise problems as a result of increased penetration of PV. Under a threshold PV penetration, it is shown that distributed storage offers a financially viable alternative to reconductoring the LV network.

Solar photovoltaic (PV) cell micro-generation has been used extensively for residential applications - especially in the state of California. Systems can be purchased by a homeowner or leased through a licensed distributor. Leasing has become a more popular option mostly because it does not require substantial upfront costs, and regularly schedules maintenance is often handled by the lessor. The inability by households to capture any tax breaks related to depreciation of solar capital equipment purchased by them also has made purchasing home systems even less appealing and continues to give leasing more of a competitive edge over purchasing. If homeowners were to choose financing a system through a home-equity loan, they would be eligible for tax breaks related to the interest paid on the loan. Our study uses a benefit-cost analysis to evaluate the impacts of combined tax breaks from depreciation and interest paid on home-equity loans on competitiveness under different purchase options for a 4kW solar PV system in California. Purchasing strategies are compared to one another based on the resulting net electricity price ($/kWh) under each option. The net electricity price metric exploits the savings in annual utility bills given the displacement of grid-based electricity by solar generation. We find that cash purchases result in the highest net electricity price. Before depreciation, the differential in net electricity prices between the home-equity loan and leasing financing options is roughly $0.07/kWh. This gap shrinks to only $0.01/kWh when both the tax breaks from depreciation and interest paid on loans are considered. Overall, our results suggest that the additional tax breaks from depreciation in conjunction with those from interest paid on home-equity loans can make purchasing much more competitive. Sensitivity analysis was conducted for key parameters, and all sensitivity tests yielded the expected results. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Solar electricity; Solar energy; Solar leasing; Solar photovoltaic",,"O'Rear, E.G.; Department of Agricultural Economics, Purdue University, 403 W.

The renewable energy optimization software HOMER is used to optimize costs of energy and carbon emission, with the outcome of energy cost ranging from $0.204/kWh to $0.372/kWh for the PV-powered EVs. Although the energy cost of PV-powered EVs is higher than that of grid-connected ones ($0.150/kWh), GHG emissions can be reduced by 47%-78%. The four models may be applicable in different development stages of EVs in China. In the short term, grid-connected EVs have cost advantages, however, considering such factors as the imposition of future carbon tax, increasing electricity supply cost and decreasing price of PV components and batteries, PV-powered EVs could dominate the EV landscape in the near future. Furthermore, our sensitivity analyses also show that the PV power sellback rate and interest rate contribute significantly to the cost of energy and can be used as policy tools to accelerate the development of transportation systems that generate low carbon emissions. © 2014 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","electric vehicle; greenhouse gas; net present cost; photovoltaic","Carbon emission intensities; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Energy storage capacity; Feasibility analysis; Net present cost; Photovoltaic; Photovoltaic electricities; Transportation system; Costs; Economic analysis; Electric power systems; Electric vehicles; Energy policy; Optimization; Greenhouse gases; carbon emission; economic analysis; electric vehicle; electricity supply; feasibility study; greenhouse gas; photovoltaic system; transportation system; China; Guangdong; Shenzhen","Ye, B.; Harbin Institute of Technology Shenzhen Graduate School, University Town, Nanshan District, Shenzhen, 518055, China; email: yebinwuxiao@gmail.com",,,15568318,,,,"English","Intl.

The number has grown substantially since then. Conventional utilities are not happy with these developments. Although the number of rooftop solar customers represents less than 1% of the customer base of traditional utilities, it presents at least a theoretical threat to the business model. The utilities take that seriously; some in the industry regard it as an existential threat. NRG Energy is one of the pioneering and biggest of the non-utility generators. CEO David Crane wants to use the natural gas distribution network to replace reliance on the electric utility grid. Noting that some 34 million American homes have a natural gas line into their home, Crane believes that all that is needed is technology that converts natural gas into electricity in one's basement, and then solar will have the partner it needs to enable consumers to totally disconnect from the grid. NRG is working with Deka Research of Manchester, NH, on a Stirling cycle engine called the Beacon 10, which can generate up to 15 kw of power. NRG's idea is to integrate the Beacon gas-fired generator with rooftop PV, thus enabling people to convert natural gas into electricity in their own home. The gas-solar system would be leased to customers, using the financial model of SolarCity that has helped spread rooftop PV systems across the US.",,,,,"TradeFair Group Publications, Ltd",00325929,,,,"English","Power",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84903288814

This paper presents a comparative assessment of the near-term economic benefits of grid-connected residential PV systems. Case studies from the UK and India are taken as examples, as they vary significantly in solar resource, customer demands, electricity prices and financial support mechanisms. A metric termed PEUC (prosumer electricity unit cost) is proposed to develop an economic evaluation methodology to assess the near-term benefits from PV systems. The results obtained showed that, under the present financial support mechanisms, domestic PV systems provide near-term economic benefits in most locations in India. For most locations in the UK, cost reduction is needed to achieve near-term financial benefits and this varies depending on the location of installation.

These hybrid systems are normally integrated with battery banks for total reliability; such systems have brought about better quality of life in remote areas of developing economics. The remote areas in the state of Tamil Nadu in India possess excellent renewable energy sources. These areas fall under different climatic zones, are sparsely populated and are in the process of development. Though these areas are connected to the grid, Tamil Nadu grid is not stable; it is currently experiencing 40% short fall in generation. Thus grid power is available to these remote areas only for 10 h a day and even when available, there are voltage frequency problems. This paper analyses the economic feasibility of installing and operating hybrid systems in these areas. The areas are divided into different climatic zones and the hybrid system economy is analyzed for each climatic zone on the basis of NPC (net present cost), consumption of diesel and renewable fraction for all climate zones. The analysis indicates that the interior climatic zone - the area would be the optimum climatic zone to install HPS PV/diesel. The sensitivity analysis proves that the NPC of such a system can be reduced. It is suggested that due to high initial cost, government subsidy is necessary to adopt the system on a large scale. Such a profit will encourage development of renewable energy utilization and bring about rapid development of these remote areas. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Given the uncertainty in future retail rates and the inherent links between rates and the customer-economics of behind-the-meter PV, there is growing interest in understanding how potential changes in rates may impact the value of bill savings from PV. In this article, we first use a production cost and capacity expansion model to project California hourly wholesale electricity market prices under two potential electricity market scenarios, including a reference and a 33% renewables scenario. Second, based on the wholesale electricity market prices generated by the model, we develop retail rates (i.e., flat, time-of-use, and real-time pricing) for each future scenario based on standard retail rate design principles. Finally, based on these retail rates, the bill savings from PV is estimated for 226 California residential customers under two types of net metering, for each scenario. We find that high renewable penetrations can drive substantial changes in residential retail rates and that these changes, together with variations in retail rate structures and PV compensation mechanisms, interact to place substantial uncertainty on the future value of bill savings from residential PV. © 2014.","Electricity rate design; Net metering; Photovoltaics",,"Darghouth, N.R.; Ernest Orlando Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, 1 Cyclotron Road, MS 90R4000, Berkeley, CA 94720, United States; email: ndarghouth@lbl.gov",,,03014215,,ENPYA,,"English","Energy Policy",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84893865834

Securitization of solar assets provides a potential solution to this problem. This paper assesses the viability of solar asset-backed securities (ABS) as a lower cost financing mechanism and identifies policies that could facilitate implementation of securitization. First, traditional solar financing is examined to provide a baseline for cost comparisons. Next, the securitization process is modeled. The model enables identification of several junctures at which risk and uncertainty influence costs. Next, parameter values are assigned and used to generate cost estimates. Results show that, under reasonable assumptions, securitization of solar power purchase agreements (PPA) can significantly reduce project financing costs, suggesting that securitization is a viable mechanism for improving the financing of PV projects. The clear impediment to the successful launch of a solar ABS is measuring and understanding the riskiness of underlying assets. This study identifies three classes of policy intervention that lower the cost of ABS by reducing risk or by improving the measurement of risk: (i) standardization of contracts and the contracting process, (ii) improved access to contract and equipment performance data, and (iii) geographic diversification. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Photovoltaic; Renewable energy financing; Securitization",,"Pearce, J.M.; Michigan Tech Open Sustainability Technology Laboratory, Michigan Technological University, Houghton, MI 49931, United States; email: pearce@mtu.edu",,,03014215,,ENPYA,,"English","Energy Policy",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84893869250

Uganda provides a typical example of an under-electrified country, with less than 12% of Ugandans having access. To address the lack of electricity access, there has been much analysis devoted to grid-connected distributed generation. What these analyses lack is a consideration that even where grid electricity reaches people, it is not always reliable; customers often experience hundreds of outage hours per month. This paper addresses this analytical shortfall to provide new methods to analyze reliable electricity and identify optimal systems to provide more reliable electricity. We adapt the HOMER (Hybrid Optimization Model for Electric Renewables) in this work to address unreliable electricity from the grid, and develop a method for determining optimal system configurations and predicting electricity costs for reliable power generation in regions with unreliable grid electricity. We demonstrate the method for a village in Uganda, but the method holds universally. Results indicate that diesel is the most economical choice, but slight increases in diesel and decreases in PV (photovoltaics) prices make solar/diesel hybrid systems competitive. Improved reliability increases cost, but the increase of can be justified for users needing more reliability. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Availability; Distributed energy systems; Grid-connected PV systems; Reliability","Availability; Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Distributed power generation; Electricity; Hybrid systems; Optimal systems; Reliability; Availability; Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Distributed power generation; Hybrid systems; Optimal systems; Optimization; Reliability; Solar power generation; Distributed energy systems; Electricity access; Electricity costs; Electricity system; Grid connected PV system; Grid electricity; Hybrid optimization model for electric renewables; Optimal system configuration; Outages; Outages; diesel engine; electrical power; hybrid; photovoltaic system; power generation; solar power; economic analysis; electricity generation; energy market; energy policy; reliability analysis; Uganda","Murphy, P.M.501 N.

Demand response, whereby the demand of electricity is adjusted to the availability, can ease this problem. A lab test setup was built to examine the potential of a heat pump for demand response purposes. With this test setup, it is possible to emulate the behaviour of a heat pump in a single household building equipped with either photovoltaic panels or a residential wind turbine. A market-based multi-agent system was developed to control the active heat pump. The goal of this active control was to limit the peak power demands of the building and to maximise the self-consumption of the locally produced electricity. For two weeks, the coldest winter week and an average winter week, the behaviour of the actively controlled heat pump was compared to a regular, heat-driven controlled heat pump.The tests show that the current heat pump controller is able to shave the power consumption peaks of the building. In this way, active control of the heat pump can diminish extra investment costs for grid reinforcement. Active control also enables self-consumption of locally produced electricity. However, because of the higher energy consumption, the current version of the active heat pump controller is not yet able to significantly decrease the consumption of grey electricity from the grid. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Demand response; Heat pump; Market-based multi-agent control; Smart grid","Demand response; Electrical distribution; Heat pumps; Multiagent control; Photovoltaic panels; Reliability and stability; Residential heat pumps; Smart grid; Demand response; Electrical distribution; Heat pumps; Multiagent control; Photovoltaic panels; Reliability and stability; Residential heat pumps; Smart grid; Commerce; Electric power transmission networks; Electric utilities; Electricity; Energy utilization; Heat pump systems; Investments; Multi agent systems; Photovoltaic cells; Commerce; Controllers; Electric power generation; Electric power transmission networks; Electric utilities; Energy utilization; Heat pump systems; Housing; Investments; Multi agent systems; Photovoltaic cells; Photovoltaic effects; Pumps; Wind turbines; Heating; Heating; cost-benefit analysis; demand analysis; electricity generation; electricity supply; energy efficiency; energy use; heat source; optimization; pump; reliability analysis; renewable resource; demand-side management; electricity generation; electricity supply; energy use; heat production; laboratory method; photovoltaic system; pump; renewable resource; residential location; wind turbine","Vanhoudt, D.; Flemish Inst. for Technological Research VITO, Boeretang 200, 2400 Mol, Belgium; email: dirk.vanhoudt@vito.be",,,09601481,,,,"English","Renew.

The system was designed to provide around the equivalent of 1000 lumens (lm) of light of the existing light fishing technology (a floating pressurised kerosene light) for artisanal light fishers to use for 8h per night on Lake Victoria and other lakes in the region (Tanganyika, Rukwa, Mweru, Kivu, etc.). The net present cost (NPC) of a technically appropriate PV-battery-LED system was calculated as US$280 over 5 years, five-times less than the existing solar-based technology, a PV-battery-compact fluorescent lamp (CFL) system, and around ten times less than the baseline pressurised kerosene-based technology over the five years. Fishers owning the new PV-battery-LED system outright will likely recoup their initial investment within a year relative to the cost of alternatives, although the upfront capital cost of the new system was higher than the pressurised kerosene and PV-battery-CFL, and found to be practically unaffordable to the subsistence fishers without microcredit. Nonetheless, the technical simulations found that the new system was also able to provide additional lighting services during the day and evening, with little (if any) electrical impact on the system when in use for light fishing during the small hours of moonless nights. This research also demonstrates that the high cost of operating pressurised kerosene lamps precludes them for use in other applications within the community, including in homes. This research suggests that facilitated local development of appropriate new light fishing technology configurations will require training of local individuals to sensitise fishing communities to the new technology, and sustain wider adoption of the more efficient, cost-effective, and safer alternative. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Artisanal fishing; Kerosene; Light emitting diode; Photovoltaic; Sub-Saharan Africa","Artisanal fishing; Battery systems; Lighting systems; Local development; Net present cost; New technologies; Photovoltaic; Sub-saharan africa; Costs; Economics; Fisheries; Kerosene; Lakes; Lighting; Technology; Light emitting diodes; artisanal fishery; cost-benefit analysis; crude oil; fishing community; photovoltaic system; renewable resource; solar power; East African Lakes; Lake Victoria; Sub-Saharan Africa","McHenry, M.P.; School of Engineering and Information Technology, Murdoch University, 90 South Street, Murdoch, WA 6150, Australia; email: mpmchenry@gmail.com",,,09601481,,,,"English","Renew.

The purpose of this paper is to propose the best hybrid technology combination for electricity generation from a mix of renewable energy resources to satisfy the electrical needs in a reliable manner of an off-grid remote village, Palari in the state of Chhattisgarh, India. Four renewable resources, namely, small-scale hydropower, solar photovoltaic systems, wind turbines and bio-diesel generators are considered. The paper estimates the residential, institutional, commercial, agricultural and small-scale industrial demand in the pre-HOMER analysis. Using HOMER, the paper identifies the optimal off-grid option and compares this with conventional grid extension. The solution obtained shows that a hybrid combination of renewable energy generators at an off-grid location can be a cost-effective alternative to grid extension and it is sustainable, techno-economically viable and environmentally sound.

In July 2013 the Italian government definitively cut FITs, leaving only tax benefits and a revised net metering scheme (known as ""Scambio sul Posto"") for new PV installations. In this scenario, the design of a new PV plant ensuring savings on electricity bills is strongly related to household electricity consumption patterns. This paper presents a high-resolution model of domestic electricity use. The model is based on Fuzzy Logic Inference System. Using as inputs patterns of active occupancy and typical domestic habits, the fuzzy model give as output the likelihood to start each appliance within the next minute. The model has been validated with electricity demand data recorded over the period of one year within 12 dwellings in the central east coast of Italy.

The specific objectives are analyses of the cost distribution of solar PV systems compared with grid electricity in homes and estimating the probability that solar can be cheaper than electricity from grids under different policy combinations. Wefirst do the analysis under current policy and then the analysis under potential policy options for a variety of scenarios. Also, the results inform government policy makers on how effective the alternative policies for encouraging solar PV systems are. The results show that current policies are important in reducing the cost of solar PV systems.

The paper presents, first, an overview of energy trends in Japan prior to the Fukushima event. This is followed by a short review of solar PV progress in the country, highlighting the major policies and programmes that have been implemented as well as the installations that have been carried out over the past two decades. Next, the financial impact of the new FiT scheme on consumers is evaluated. The financial analysis investigates the total profit, the average annual return on investment and the payback period. For a comparison purposes, a similar financial analysis is also conducted with selected countries around the world - namely Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom. The results from this analysis indicate that the new Japanese FiT rate generates a good profit, a moderate annual return on investment and an acceptable payback period, suggesting an increasing trend of solar PV uptake over the next years. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Feed-in tariff; Financial analysis; Photovoltaic; Solar energy","Housing; Investments; Solar concentrators; Solar energy; Finance; Housing; Investments; Profitability; Solar concentrators; Solar energy; Annual returns; Feed-in tariff; Financial analysis; Financial impacts; Payback periods; Photovoltaic; Renewable energies; Solar photovoltaics; Residential sectors; Profitability; Solar power generation; economic analysis; investment; nuclear accident; photovoltaic system; renewable resource; solar power; solar radiation; tariff structure; cost-benefit analysis; financial system; policy implementation; temporal analysis; Japan; Fukushima [Tohoku]; Germany; Honshu; Italy; Tohoku; United Kingdom","Muhammad-Sukki, F.; School of Engineering and Built Environment, Glasgow Caledonian University, 70 Cowcaddens Road, Glasgow, G4 0BA Scotland, United Kingdom; email: firdaus.muhammadsukki@gcu.ac.uk",,"Elsevier BV",09601481,,,,"English","Renew.

The rooftops of buildings can be utilized for solar power generation using this technology, and are considered to be highly promising sites for urban PV installations due to land space limitations. However, to properly plan such installations decision makers would need to have detailed information about the amount of rooftop area that is available, as well as the distribution of individual rooftop sizes. In this paper a machine learning based approach for detecting rooftops is proposed and its utility for planning rooftop PV installations is demonstrated via a simple pilot study on two different residential areas in Abu Dhabi, UAE. The proposed method uses a twostage classification model to estimate the rooftop area that is available for solar panel installation. Next, a comparative study of three different types of PV technologies is conducted in terms of energy generation and economic viability. The results obtained from these experiments suggest that thin-film panels may have a distinct advantage over other PV technologies. Even though the cost of PV panels is still quite high, this could be balanced by the potential benefits to the environment. If reasonable subsidies and feed-in tariffs are implemented, PV technology can become a cost effective option for the UAE. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.","Economic Analysis; Energy generation; PV systems; Rooftop detection","Cost effectiveness; Decision making; Economic analysis; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Photovoltaic cells; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Urban growth; Classification models; Comparative studies; Economic viability; Energy generations; Photovoltaic technology; Potential benefits; PV system; Rooftop detections; Space power generation","Woon, W.L.; Masdar Institute of Science and Technology, P.O.

The hybrid power system consists of three 500 kW diesel generators, 1500 kW photovoltaic arrays, 600 kW battery storages, and 1000 kW converter. The power system is capable of providing 1000 kW average load and up to 2300 kW peak load. The total electrical load which can be generated from this system is equal to 9,133,835 kWh in a year. The proposed hybrid system is evaluated using Hybrid Optimization Model for Electric Renewable (HOMER).

The cost of energy (COE) for PV/diesel/battery power system with 27% solar penetration was found to be 0.313$/kWh for a diesel price of 0.9$/l. The techno-economic analysis for the optimal hybrid system is presented to evaluate the decentralized generation and compare with grid extension for Um Azimul. The achieved results show that the stand-alone PV-Diesel power system is more feasible and economical than grid extension.

The heat pump uses the warm air generated in the Building Integrated Photovoltaic-Thermal Collector (BIPV/T) as the source for heat production. The coupling of BIPV/T and ASHP enables a highly efficient heating system in winter conditions. The developed TRNSYS model was simulated for different regions to predict the seasonal performance of the heat pump. The results from the simulation were used to estimate the saving in energy and cost as well as to predict the electricity related greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction potential from the PV panels. The results showed that annual GHG emission due to electricity demand by the ASHP was reduced by 225 kg CO 2 for ASHP + PV/T. The annual electricity cost credit from PV production based on Time-of-Use (TOU) and the reduction in electricity cost of the heat pump when connected with PV/T systems was calculated and compared with the cost of working the heat pump alone.

The objective is to evaluate the optimum PV system to power BWRO desalination system that can produce 60 m3/d at constant daily load profile for locations at different latitudes ranging from 60°S to 60°N worldwide. Different design configurations are simulated using ROSA software. Simulations showed that two-stage RO system is the better option with lower energy consumption. Hybrid optimization model for electric renewables (HOMER) is used to evaluate a range of equipment and design options over varying constraints and sensitivities in terms of sizing for the economic optimization of the PV power system. The minimum initial cost of the PV system is $102,000 and found at latitudes 50° S/N, while the maximum initial cost is $133,000 and found at latitude −60°. The economic performance of the PV system is then optimized under Malaysia latitude by allowing portions of the annual load to go unserved. The result shows that the optimum combination is a system with a 28 kW PV array, 76 batteries, and 12 kW converter with 1.5% annual unmet load fraction at 2° of PV slope. Allowing a small percentage of loads to go unserved throughout the year reduces the cost of the system.

The global solar radiation data and residential energy consumption in Jos, (in Plateau state) located on the latitude of 9° 52' N and longitude of 8° 54' E are used. Hybrid Optimization Model for Electric Renewable (HOMER) software has been employed to carry out the present study. At current diesel price of $1.1/L and annual mean global solar radiation of 6.00kWh/m2/day, it was found that PV/Generator/Battery hybrid system is economically the most suitable option as a stand-alone electricity generating system in this location and other similar locations in the Northern part of Nigeria. The optimal simulation results indicate that the levelised cost of energy for this hybrid energy system varies between $0.348/kWh and $0.378/kWh depending on the interest rate. These costs are lower than the cost of using diesel generator only (without battery) which varies between $0.417 and $0.423 per kWh. It was further observed that there is a significant reduction in emissions of greenhouse gases if a hybrid energy system is used instead of only a generator based energy system.

The stochastic nature of PV output coupled with the characteristic of high R/X ratio of LV distribution network results in a direct correlation between PV power and voltage fluctuations. Currently distribution networks rely heavily on existing On Load Tap Changing (OLTC) transformers to mitigate voltage fluctuations. However, during the regulation process OLTC transformers can experience excessive tap changing with high PV penetration, which in turn results in an increased maintenance requirement and shorter lifetime. Without the knowledge of how an increase in PV penetration impacts the operation of an OLTC, a Distribution Network Operator (DNO) cannot effectively coordinate compensation. This paper examines the effect of PV penetration levels on OLTC transformers and voltage regulation. The investigation of tap changing frequencies and voltage profiles is done through quasi-static time-series simulations using a residential street network and one year real world data obtained from local DNOs and research institutes. Then, a mitigation strategy is developed using a Distribution Static Compensator (DSTATCOM) and interaction between OLTC and DSTATCOM is also analyzed. This will enable DNOs to choose an appropriate size of DSTATCOM based on economic and technical requirements of voltage regulation. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Distribution system; Photovoltaic; PV power variability; Tap changer transformer; Voltage regulation","Housing; Photovoltaic cells; Voltage control; Voltage regulators; Distribution network operators; Distribution static compensator; Distribution systems; Low-voltage distributions; LV distribution networks; Photovoltaic; Power variability; Tap changers; Electric power factor correction","Saha, T.K.; School of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering, University of Queensland, St. Lucia, QLD 4072Australia; email: saha@itee.uq.edu.au",,"Elsevier BV",03787796,,EPSRD,,"English","Electr Power Syst Res",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84896530506

With the reductions in the cost of PV systems and the increasing maturity of CHP systems an opportunity exists for widespread commercialization of the technology, particularly for new construction. In order to determine the potential for this opportunity and to optimize the design of PV-CHP systems for greatest emission and cost reductions in the residential context a simulation, an optimization model has been developed using multiobjective genetic algorithms called the Photovoltaic-Trigeneration Optimization Model (PVTOM). In this paper, PVTOM is applied to emission-intensive and rapidly growing communities of Calgary, Canada. Results consistently show decreases in emissions necessary to provide both electrical and thermal energy for individual homes of all types. The savings range from 3000-9000kgCO2e/year, which represents a reduction of 21-62% based on the type of loads in the residential household for the lowest economic cost hybrid system.

Due to the restricted space availability as well as the regulatory limitations for the allowable installed capacity, optimization of the modules' configuration becomes an important aspect toward maximization of PV investment efficiency. In this study, a design methodology for the optimal deployment of PV rows installed on flat-roofs is presented. The proposed methodology includes a photovoltaic energy production model that takes into consideration the PV self-shading losses and their effect on the energy production, while the optimization process is performed by considering the effect of rows geometry on the energy output and on the net present value. These optimization problems are formulated as constrained nonlinear programming problems and they are solved by using well-known deterministic methods. The results from a case study illustrate the importance of the interaction between the PV panels dimension and the geometry of the created PV rows with regard to optimal PV field designs under appropriate constraints. Further and as far as financial parameters like investment cost and feed-in-tariff are concerned, the results suggest that economic profitability is not always leading to energy maximization and thus suitable designs must be applied. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Grid-connected PV systems; Net present value; PV design optimization; Residential rooftop photovoltaics; Self-shading losses","Constrained optimization; Design; Housing; Investments; Nonlinear programming; Photovoltaic cells; Design optimization; Grid connected PV system; Net present value; Photovoltaics; Self-shading; Photovoltaic effects","Stefanakis, N.E.; Solar Engineering Unit, School of Chemical Engineering, National Technical University of Athens, 9 Heroon Polytechneiou, 15780 Athens, Attica, Greece; email: nstefa@chemeng.ntua.gr",,"Elsevier BV",03787788,,ENEBD,,"English","Energy Build.",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84898484116

To simulate this operation, a software tool namely HOMER is used. The research is divided into 3 stages; data collection, simulation and data analysis stages. Data collection involves collecting and sorting the average data of solar radiation, wind speed and load profile in Terengganu as well as other necessary parameters through the off-grid PV/wind system located in Terengganu with reference to the NASA meteorology data. Simulation stage is then undertaken and optimised by resizing the parameters apart from determining the feasibility of the system using HOMER software.

Battery storage connected to solar PV (photovoltaic) array would reduce these effects in the presence of alternative price tariffs that incentivise households to shift load and reduce the peak demand. This challenge is addressed using a choice-diffusion model to forecast PV and battery storage uptake to 2025 for a case study in Townsville, Australia. Sensitivity of uptake is tested for six different price tariffs based on flat, time-of-use and critical-peak-pricing. Uptake of battery storage connected to solar PV ranged between 3% and 5.4% of households at 2025, depending on the price tariff, with the larger PV/battery options being more popular. Percentage of households disconnecting from the grid at 2025 is in the order of one percent depending on the price tariff.

The expected economics of DER in 2020-2025 is modeled for a commercial and a multi-family residential building in different climate zones. The optimal building energy economic performance is calculated using the Distributed Energy Resources Customer Adoption Model (DER-CAM) which minimizes building energy costs for a typical reference year of operation. Several DER such as combined heat and power (CHP) units, photovoltaics, and battery storage are considered. The results indicate DER have economic and environmental competitiveness potential, especially for commercial buildings in hot and cold climates of both countries. In the U.S., the average expected energy cost savings in commercial buildings from DER-CAMs suggested investments is 17%, while in Chinese buildings is 12%. The electricity tariffs structure and prices along with the cost of natural gas, represent important factors in determining adoption of DER, more so than climate. High energy pricing spark spreads lead to increased economic attractiveness of DER.

In this paper, the calculative accuracy of TRNSYS, Archelios, Polysun, PVSyst, PV*SOL and PVGIS is being examined in comparison to the real electrical energy generated by a grid-connected 19.8kWp photovoltaic installation. The assessment has been performed by using the climatic data which have been recorded at the site of the real photovoltaics (PV) park over the same calendar year.

A specific electric load profile was developed to suite the community consisting 200 homes, a school and a community health center. The data obtained from the Nigeria Meteorological Department, Oshodi, Lagos (daily mean wind speeds, and daily global solar radiation for 24 years from 1987 to 2010) were used. An assessment of the design that will optimally meet the daily load demand with a loss of load probability (LOLP) of 0.01 was performed, considering 3 stand-alone applications of photovoltaic (PV), wind and diesel, and 3 hybrid designs of wind-PV, wind-diesel, and solar-diesel. The diesel standalone system (DSS) was taken as the basis of comparison as the experimental location has no connection to a distribution network. The HOMER® software optimizing tool was engaged following the feasibility analysis with the RETScreen software. The wind standalone system (WSS) was found to be the optimal means of producing renewable electricity in terms of life cycle cost as well as levelised cost of producing energy at $0.15/(kW$h). This is competitive with grid electricity, which is presently at a cost of approximately $0.09/(kW$h) and 410% better than the conventional DSS at a levelized cost of energy (LCOE) of $0.62/kWh.

The analysis follows a multicriteria approach. It uses a method called compromise programming and takes into account the technical, economical, environmental and social criteria. The hybrid optimization model for electric renewables (HOMER) software was used to generate alternative energy sets through enumerative search, with which decisional matrices were built for each case study. The influence of weighting for each criterion was assessed. In the case of self-sufficiency in UNISTMO, when the decision-making center has a preference for the minimization of equivalent emissions in the life cycle (ESLC), a wind system is suitable. On the other hand, when there is a preference for the minimization of levelized cost of energy, a photovoltaic (PV) system is suitable; both systems connected to the national electrical grid. Obviously, a preference for the minimization of capital cost led to keeping the power supply from the grid. In the case of Gran Piedra, a diesel generator-based system is suitable when the criterion 'capital cost' absorbs 70% or more of the preferences of the decision-making centers. When the preference is less than 70% regardless of the weighting given to other criteria, the best alternatives are those involving renewable technologies, reaching renewable fractions of 75% and 94% in two potential configurations of energetic systems. © 2013 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.","HOMER software; Hybrid systems; Hydrogen technology; Life cycle; Multicriteria analysis","Decision making; Energy policy; Hybrid systems; Hydrogen storage; Life cycle; Compromise programming; Homer softwares; Hybrid optimization model for electric renewables; Hydrogen technologies; Multi Criteria Analysis; Multi-criteria approach; Photovoltaic systems; Renewable technology; Electric power distribution","Sebastian, P.J.; Solar Materials, Energy Research Center-UNAM, Temixco, Morelos, Mexico; email: sjp@ier.unam.mx",,"John Wiley and Sons Ltd",0363907X,,IJERD,,"English","Int.

By ""smart-scheduling"" the electricity and domestic hot water demand of the dishwasher, clothes washer, dryer, sinks and showers solely to off-peak periods, the peak demand is reduced by 18%, the part-peak demand by 32% and the off-peak demand increased by 12%.

Most of these distributed generators are renewable energy facilities using wind turbine generators or photovoltaic power systems. The increase in distributed generators is mostly due to environmental issues, growing concern of resource depletion, and economic benefits for residents and homeowners. Along with the increase in distributed generators, all-electric apartment buildings and residential homes with electric vehicles are on the rise. This trend is beneficial for both the environment and the residents; however, the fluctuating power from renewable energy sources and unstable loads causes fluctuations in grid frequency and distributed voltage which become problematic. This paper presents a methodology to control system frequency and distributed voltage using distributed controllable loads such as the heat pump water heater (HP) and large capacity batteries such as those of the electric vehicle (EV).

At the same time, the price of electricity in Spain has increased just as sharply. Both factors are making possible that self-consumption with photovoltaic systems may be economically feasible soon in Spain and especially in Extremadura, since this is a region with high levels of solar radiation. If suitable policies are promoted, this new scheme could provide a way of savings for consumers and at the same time, a significant boost for the PV industry.In this paper, the economic feasibility of these systems in single-family houses in Extremadura is analysed. The methodological approach is based on the definition of a type-home, and then on the sizing and profitability analysis of the PV system by considering different regulatory scenarios.The results indicate that acceptable profitabilities could be obtained in 2015 for net metering, when scenarios with sharp increases in electricity prices are taken into account. For less optimistic scenarios, net metering and self-consumption with sale of the surplus energy should be profitable in 2016 and 2017, respectively. Morover, it is clear that self-consumption without sale of the surplus energy is not profitable in housing.The analysis also indicates that if the Spanish Government were to approve the so-called ""support toll"" then the profitability of photovoltaic systems would be severely hit, and it would be necessary, in the best case, to wait until 2017 for the installations to be viable with a certain guarantee of profitability. © 2014.

A typical Villa-type house is assessed when BIPV is installed and the equivalent annual cost at different discount rates from 0% to 20% is calculated. The corresponding reduction of CO2 emission at the power station is also estimated. The results are then extrapolated for all residential houses in Qatar and the total CO2 savings are then calculated. An economic analysis is performed and the payback period (PBP) for the BIPV is calculated taking into account the initial cost and the maintenance cost. The calculations performed showed that the cost per kWh is 6.85 cents, thus the annual cost per house at 0% discount rate is around $4,193 including savings on CO2 emissions. The PBP for the BIPV is calculated to be 34 years. The total CO2 emissions' savings are estimated to be around 2.17 MtCO2 per year which is equivalent to 65 million USD per year.","CO2 emissions; Cost; Electricity; Photovoltaic; Qatar; Solar energy",,"Chamoun, R.; Qatar Environment and Energy Research Institute, Qatar Foundation, Education city, P.O.

Other scenarios, which consider higher discount rate, higher initial investment and slower learning curves, show similar results, where most cities will reach the grid parity before of 2028. © The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.","Energy microgeneration; Grid parity; Learning curves; Photovoltaic system",,"Jiménez, M.; Universidad Nacional de ColombiaColombia",,"Universidad Nacional de Colombia",00127353,,,,"English","DYNA",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84918571808

By combining LCC and LCA, a LCM (life cycle management) perspective is portrayed to support decision-making on a long-term basis. The comparable energy design options analysed are (1) district heating (reference design), (2) district heating with building integrated photovoltaic panels, (3) ground source heat pump, and (4) ground source heat pump with building-integrated photovoltaic panels. The results show that the design option with the highest initial investment (4) is in fact the most viable from a life cycle perspective. This study further strengthens the connection between cost savings and carbon emissions reduction in a life cycle context.

We performed cost optimizations for grid-only, PV/battery, and grid/PV systems for the semiconductor facility. The environmental impact was evaluated by estimating the amount of polluting emissions. The grid-only system showed the lowest net present cost and cost of energy, and by connecting the PV system to the grid, the amount of pollutants was decreased by 10% with a renewable fraction 9%. If we consider a renewable PV/battery system, a 100% renewable fraction and zero emissions can be achieved. In addition, sensitivity analyses were performed. Under the assumption that PV costs decrease and grid costs increase, it was found that grid/PV and grid/PV/battery systems are economically more competitive than grid-only systems.

California Blvd., Pasadena, CA 91106, United States","The price of electricity supplied from home rooftop photo voltaic (PV) solar cells has fallen below the retail price of grid electricity in some areas. A number of residential households have an economic incentive to install rooftop PV systems and reduce their purchases of electricity from the grid. A significant portion of the costs incurred by utility companies are fixed costs which must be recovered even as consumption falls. Electricity rates must increase in order for utility companies to recover fixed costs from shrinking sales bases. Increasing rates will, in turn, result in even more economic incentives for customers to adopt rooftop PV. In this paper, we model this feedback between PV adoption and electricity rates and study its impact on future PV penetration and net-metering costs. We find that the most important parameter that determines whether this feedback has an effect is the fraction of customers who adopt PV in any year based solely on the money saved by doing so in that year, independent of the uncertainties of future years. These uncertainties include possible changes in rate structures such as the introduction of connection charges, the possibility of PV prices dropping significantly in the future, possible changes in tax incentives, and confidence in the reliability and maintainability of PV. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Distributed energy adoption; Electricity rate spiral; PV adoption","Connection charges; Distributed energies; Economic incentive; Grid electricity; PV adoption; Pv penetrations; Rate structure; Utility companies; Cost accounting; Costs; Housing; Industry; Purchasing; Sales; Taxation; Electricity; electricity supply; household energy; photovoltaic system; price determination; residential energy","Cai, D.W.H.; Department of Electrical Engineering, California Institute of Technology, 1200 E.

Recent years have witnessed a shift toward third-party-owned (TPO) business models, in which the absence of a cash purchase price obscures data interpretation. Appraisals-often based on estimates of the average fair market value across a diverse fleet of systems-are one way TPO prices are reported. Scope: This study investigates residential PV system price drivers to improve the accuracy, consistency, and relevance of PV price-tracking efforts. Our econometric approach evaluates system price drivers using California Solar Initiative data, controlling for system, installer, and geographic variables. Conclusions: We find that reported prices for confirmed appraised systems are $1.13/W higher than non-appraised systems and do not respond to hypothesized price drivers. For non-appraised systems, we find preliminary evidence of market distortions based on the impact of the incentive level, module cost and household income on reported price.

The research evaluates the determinants of user satisfaction and households' perceptions of the benefits of SHS, including the quality of SHS equipment and reduction in energy costs. The econometric analysis reveals that previous poor experience of the frequency of battery repairs and replacement in SHS negatively influences the satisfaction of households with SHS. The research also suggests user satisfaction improves in the households that achieve lower dependence on kerosene. Moreover, the users who receive the benefits of SHS, especially those resulting from an increase in children's study time, show a higher level of satisfaction with SHS.

Hydrogen has the highest energy content per unit mass as compared to chemical fuel and can be substituted. Its burning process is non-polluting, and it can be used in the fuel cells to produce both electricity and useful heat. Photovoltaic arrays can be used in supplying the water electrolysis systems by their energy requirements. During the daylight hours, the sunlight on the photovoltaic array converts into electrical energy which can be used for electrolyzer. The hydrogen produced by the electrolyzer is compressed and stored in hydrogen vessel and provides energy for the fuel cell to meet the load when the solar energy is insufficient. This study investigates a stand-alone power system that consists of PV array as power supply and electrolyzer. They have been integrated and worked at the Taleghan renewable energies' site in Iran.

The POLES global energy model has been modified to widen the coverage of climate change impacts on the European energy system. The impacts considered are changes in heating and cooling demand in the residential and services sector, changes in the efficiency of thermal power plants, and changes in hydro, wind (both on- and off-shore) and solar PV electricity output. Results of the impacts of six scenarios on the European energy system are presented, and the implications for European energy security and energy imports are presented. Main findings include: demand side impacts (heating and cooling in the residential and services sector) are larger than supply side impacts; power generation from fossil-fuel and nuclear sources decreases and renewable energy increases; and impacts are larger in Southern Europe than in Northern Europe. There remain many more climate change impacts on the energy sector that cannot currently be captured due to a variety of issues including: lack of climate data, difficulties translating climate data into energy-system-relevant data, lack of detail in energy system models where climate impacts act.

The study focused on technical and cost issues of a pilot-project set up in an environmental protection area, located in the state of Tocantins, Brazil. A comparative analysis of the costs of the hybrid system after optimization was made with the aid of the HOMER© (Hybrid Optimization Model for Electric Renewables) program. The analysis shows that the optimal system's initial cost, net present cost, and electricity cost with the hydrogen storage system is US$ 87,138; US$102,323; and US$ 1.351/kWh, respectively. Components are costly (fuel cell and electrolyzer), with the photovoltaic modules and the electrolyzer presenting the main cost of system. Based on the results, the study confirmed that the best option for storing energy from photovoltaic systems is still the use of batteries.

Ren et al. proposed a novel approach using a simple linear programming that minimizes the total energy costs for residential buildings in Japan. However, their approach is based on a specific net tariff system that was used in Japan until October 2009, and it is not applicable to Japan's current net tariff system. We propose a modified approach for Japan's current tariff system. The mathematical formulation is general in the sense that it includes formulations for other tariff systems as special cases. Therefore, the approach is applicable not only to the Japanese system but also to other tariff systems (e.g.; gross feed-in tariff system). We further extend this approach by using a robust optimization technique to cope with the uncertainty in photovoltaic power generation caused by weather variability. Numerical experiments show the minimum size requirements of solar photovoltaic systems for meeting CO2 reduction targets and their economic costs in nominal and robust cases. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","CO 2 reduction target; Irradiation uncertainty; Optimal size; Photovoltaic energy system; Robust optimization","Grid-connected photovoltaic system; Mathematical formulation; Optimal size; Photovoltaic energy systems; Photovoltaic power generation; Reduction targets; Robust optimization; Solar photovoltaic system; Cost reduction; Linear programming; Optimization; Photovoltaic cells; Solar energy; Carbon dioxide","Takeda, A.; Department of Administration Engineering, Keio University, 3-14-1 Hiyoshi, Kouhoku, Yokohama, Kanagawa 223-8522, Japan; email: takeda@ae.keio.ac.jp",,,18683967,,,,"English","Energy Syst.",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84881329874

Viewed against this background, the relationship between lignite industry and regional actors, and the interactions between the two play a major role in the perspectives for this branch of Germany's energy sector. Today, the links between the lignite industry and regional bodies are those of a partnership at eye-level. This type of relationship between the industry and regional actors has led to new forms and methods of cooperation at various levels. This is particularly evident in the efforts to re-shape the regional structure, develop the structure of townships and strengthen the economic structure. One prime example of this re-shaping of the regional structure in the wake of opencast mining operations can be found in the Indeland project in the west of the Rhenish lignite-mining area. There, the county in charge and several towns and municipalities in the environs of the Inden opencast mine have joined together under the moderation of a charitable foundation based in Aachen to redevelop the structure of the entire rural area around the mine. A further inter-municipal initiative of this type is the Terra Nova project in the area of the Hambach and Bergheim opencast mines where - within the scope of Regionale 2010 - an overall regional concept was worked out from several modules with the support of RWE. It is currently being implemented. Not only at regional, but also at municipal level, we find new forms of cooperation between the lignite industry and local actors. The personal commitment of employees in social initiatives - sponsored by the Company - plays as large a role here as does pinpointed cooperation between the Company and the municipalities in developing or modernising residential quarters in a rural area where demographic change can cause considerable shifts. The inclusion of local people in workshops and workgroups is an important element in drawing up village-development concepts. Today, strengthening the economic structure is likewise perceived and performed as a joint task by the lignite industry and regional actors. Behind this is the realisation that a region's economic clout should be strengthened and diversified to include other mainstays besides lignite. Various sectors lend themselves for such diversification, including the food industry, say. RWE Power has been successfully working in this area for some time now on utilising the energy content of waste heat from cooling-tower and sump water for agricultural production. Among the traditional joint activities of the lignite industry and regional bodies are the development of industrial estates and a corresponding settlement policy, above all for SMEs. Such estates have been implemented or are being planned at various locations in the mining area, and this has triggered sizable investment. In the past ten years alone, more than 3500 jobs have been created. In such project developments, too, the striking fact is that lignite companies and municipalities act as partners - risks and opportunities are shared on a partnership basis. One new field of action in cooperation at municipal level involves so-called energy partnerships. These concern projects in the form of stakeholder models in renewable energy. They are initiated by RWE, but municipalities, and citizens, too, can acquire stakes in power-generation facilities based on photovoltaics or wind power. The diverse new forms of cooperation between lignite and region are also reflected in organisational forms. At local-government level, we have framework agreements in which municipalities and Company come to arrangements on joint aims and their implementation. At regional level, the equivalents are ""inter-municipal planning communities"" that deal with larger-scale projects. The project ""Innovationsregion Rheinisches Revier"" (Innovation region Rhenish mining area) works at a third level, called into being at state level to address area-crossing issues. Overall, what the new partnership-based forms of cooperation are about is making a valuable joint contribution to the long-term, thriving development of the region, in which lignite continues to play a major role, although new partners will grow in importance and perspective.",,"Agricultural productions; Demographic changes; Framework agreements; German lignite industry; Project development; Regional development; Regional structure; Traditional joints; Economics; Energy policy; Investments; Mergers and acquisitions; Regional planning; Rural areas; Waste heat; Wind power; Lignite","RWE Power AG, Braunkohleplanung und -Entwicklung, Stüttgenweg 2, 50935 Köln, Germany",,,16132408,,,,"German; English","World Min.

The vast majority of the commercial solutions for residential applications are mainly intended to be used as solar water heaters with the bonus of electricity generation over the same collector area, replacing traditional solar heater solutions. In this paper, the energetic and economic performance of commercially available PV/T systems for electricity and domestic hot water production is being evaluated for use in three European countries, each under entirely different climatic and economic conditions.

We first examine the impact of policies on the deployment of solar PV. We show that cash incentives increase the deployment of commercial systems. We also show that interconnection standards potentially promote the deployment of residential systems, whereas property tax incentives potentially foster the deployment of commercial systems. We next examine the impact of policies on the cost of solar PV, and show that the key policies have different effects on costs. The cost of residential systems declines faster if there are cash or property tax incentives in place, whereas the presence of interconnection standards potentially accelerates the decline in commercial system costs. Further, states with a renewable portfolio standard see residential system costs potentially declining slower than states without such a policy.

It highlights the value of PV electricity for the GCC society from the perspective of consumers, utilities and environment. Through a systematic modelling analysis it is shown that the efficiency of PV system drops by 4-6% due to high range of module temperature and also a change in power output due to high ambient temperatures. Consequently, the outputs of horizontal and vertical PV modules are found to be less than estimates based on standard test conditions. Economically, this study shows that building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) systems are not viable in GCC countries and cannot compete with conventional electricity sources on a unit cost basis. From a society point of view, however, the integration of PV technology into buildings would have several benefits for the GCC countries, including: first, savings in capital cost due to central power plants and transmission and distribution processes; second, an increase in the exported oil and natural gas used for electricity generation; and third, a reduction in the CO2 emissions from conventional power plants.

The present work demonstrates the convenience of employing economic feasibility assessments together with engineering analyses before applying solar strategies during the design stages, in order to convince house owners that these solar technologies can be economically viable. In a case study, this approach is tested for a real house project developed in North Cyprus (NC) in which solar energy applications for electricity generation, hot water preparation, space heating and passive cooling are investigated. It is reported that grid-connected photovoltaic (PV) systems would be economically feasible with savings-to-investment ratio (SIR) values of 2.9 to 3.4. A thermal performance analysis is carried out for a thermal storage wall (TSW) together with a direct solar gain (DSG) window in the living room. It is discovered that the temperature range of the living room was within 18-22°C throughout the majority of winter days. This application is also proved to be economically feasible with an SIR of 1.3, compared to installing an 18,000Btu/h heat pump. It is determined that both locally produced solar water heaters and imported solar water heaters (ISWHs) are economically viable compared to using a 3-kW storage-type electric water heater. Their SIR values are estimated to be 7.5 and 3.7, respectively. A solar-assisted stack-effect ventilation (SEV) system is verified to have techno-economic feasibility and is also useful in concealing the unattractive cold and hot water storage tanks on the roof. The prospective house owner decides to invest 3840 EUR in installing a grid-connected PV system of 1 kWp, an ISWH, a DSG window, building a TSW for space heating and a SEV system with an overall SIR value of 3.2. This procedure can be developed into a government policy where all these assessments are made mandatory to increase the awareness of the home builders before they make their decisions about the final designs of their houses.

The basic scenario examined in this work assessed possible electricity unit cost taking into account the penetration of PV modules of about 5 to 10 kW PV systems as roof-tops for residential use, without storage capability in prevailing local conditions in the northern region of KSA, i.e. city of Arar. Based on the input data and assumptions made, the simulations indicated that the scenario to meet the electrical demand of Arar would require installing at least 20-30 central modules, with a capacity of about 10 MW each. But it is not possible to meet the total electrical demand by employing distributed PV modules. In addition, the cost The estimated cost of produced electricity is about 0.1-0.12 US$/kWh and considered very high compared with the current prices of about US$ 0.013 per kWh. Without government incentives, i.e. feed-in-tariff or any other financial scheme aiming to encourage the utilization of renewable energy resources, such systems will not be feasible or find its way in KSA. However, the sensitivity analysis on current fuel prices, used for power generation, showed that increasing the local fuel prices would make such plants more economically attractive compared with conventional systems. © 2013, European Association for the Development of Renewable Energy, Environment and Power Quality (EA4EPQ).

A combination of solar energy and wind energy as intermittent renewable energy sources with a fuel cell (FC) system and a battery storage energy system as a backup to the green energy system is introduced for this study. This system is eco-friendly, economical over the long-term, highly sustainable and reliable. In addition, a diesel-based energy system as a non-green system is compared with the proposed green system. National Renewable Energy Laboratory's (NREL) HOMER software is used to determine and compare the optimal configuration green energy system with the diesel-based energy system in terms of net present cost, sensitivity analysis and pollutant gas emission. The feasibility and assessment of the proposed system is evaluated by utilizing the load profile and considering the geographical condition of a village (Juara village in Tioman Island) with approximately 30 chalets located in southern Malaysia. HOMER uses two types of load profiles for each given year. The first load profile is used during the presence of tourists, and the second profile is used when the locals are the main inhabitants of the island. The optimization management for the green energy system is performed through unit sizing to find the optimum power management analysis and to perform cost analysis of the system. The potential of renewable energy as well as a diesel-based energy system to meet the power demand for such a stand-alone system is considered.

As a country that is primarily depended on fossil fuels for generating power supply, Malaysia needs to cogitate of long-term energy security due to fossil fuel depletion and peak oil issues. Loss of these resources could leadto thereduction of power generation capacitywhich will threaten the stability of the electricity supply in Malaysia. This could potentially influence in an increase in electricity costs which lead to a phase of power scarcity and load shedding for the country. With the risk of interrupted power supplies, rural households, especially those of low-income groups are particularly vulnerable to the post-effects of a power outage and an inequitable distribution to the people. Distributed generation of electricity by solar PVs diminishes the vulnerability of these households and can also offer an income to them by feeding the power supply to the national grid through Feed-in Tariff scheme. At the moment, the deployment of solar PV installations is still in the introductory stage in Malaysia, where roof-mounted PV panels are only available to commercial and urban residential buildings. This is due to the lack of a suitable renewable energy policy for rural households and the high cost of the solar PV technology. This paper will put forward an analysis for incorporating solar photovoltaic on roofs of rural houses by identifying the energy consumption of these households and the extent to which PVs can alleviate electricity insecurity. The results present significant potential for distributed PV power generation in rural areas in Malaysia which shown a considerable amount of electricity needed to be harvested from roof-mounted solar PV for rural people in Malaysia. © IJRED.","Cost-benefit analysis; Feed-in tariff; Pay-back period; Photovoltaic; Rural housing",,"Ahmad, N.A.; Department of Building Surveying, Faculty of Architecture, Planning and Surveying, UniversitiTeknologi MARA (UiTM)Malaysia; email: nahm066@aucklanduni.ac.nz",,"Diponegoro university Indonesia - Center of Biomass and Renewable Energy (CBIORE)",22524940,,,,"English","Internat.

The Flemish government has already reduced the value of future green certificates, because they appeared to be excessively high. Currently, power providers have to pay for these certificates. Owners not having a PV installation suspect that they will be charged for those additional costs in the form of rising energy bills. As such, it seems that investing in PV panels would end up being the cheapest option for them in the long run. At the same time, we observe the following trends in analyzing costs and benefits in installing PV panels in the Flemish residential sector: the PV industry is booming causing PV panels to become cheaper; energy prices will continue to rise (with or without including the recovery of green certificates costs); tax revenues on the investment cost will be abolished; and the value of green certificates decreases when households postpone their investment in PV panels. It is therefore worth investigating when the investment in PV panels for the Flemish residential sector is optimal in terms of time. We compare the timing of different investments by analyzing their future value and return, embedded in a sensitivity analysis. By forecasting all relevant parameters, the analysis points out that the best period for investing in PV panels for the Flemish residential sector was December 2010 or June 2011. After 2011, PV panels remain a responsible financial investment but with a lower rate of return. The results further indicate that investment in PV panels was and still remains over-subsidized: the energy cost savings alone are almost sufficient to cover the investment cost. Therefore, the government should continue to decrease the subsidies in the near future. Apart from saving money, this would also stimulate the average Flemish household to invest in PV panels as soon as possible. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Economic analysis; Flemish residential sector; Investment timing; PV panels","Additional costs; Costs and benefits; Energy bills; Energy cost savings; Energy prices; Financial investments; Flanders; Green certificates; Investment costs; Investment timing; Photovoltaic panels; Power providers; PV installations; PV panel; Rate of return; Residential sectors; Tax revenue; Costs; Earnings; Economic analysis; Electric utilities; Photovoltaic cells; Investments; certification; cost-benefit analysis; installation; investment; photovoltaic system; Belgium; Flanders","De Boeck, L.; HUBrussel, Center for Informatics, Modeling and Simulation, Warmoesberg 26, 1000 Brussels, Belgium; email: liesje.deboeck@hubrussel.be",,,09601481,,,,"English","Renew.

This study examined whether capital subsidies are cost effective in relation to the installation of solar photovoltaic (PV) facility. To do this, the capacity factor, which is one of the crucial factors for determining the unit cost of electricity from a solar PV system, was estimated from the monthly average clearness index data collected at various cities in Korea. Thermoeconomic analysis was applied to calculate the unit cost of electricity based on the calculated capacity factor of the solar PV system. Instead of subsidizing the same percent of the capital cost of each PV system installation, it is reasonable for the government to adopt a measure to match the subsidy paid to the payback period of the initial investment for all 5 million potential solar PV users in Korea. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Payback period; Photovoltaic; Thermoeconomic analysis","Capacity factors; Capital costs; Capital subsidy; Clearness indices; Cost effective; Feed-in tariff; Payback periods; Photovoltaic; PV system; Renewable energies; Residential house; Solar photovoltaics; Solar PV systems; Solar PVs; Thermoeconomic analysis; Unit cost of electricity; Costs; Factor analysis; Investments; Cost benefit analysis; capital flow; economic analysis; energy policy; energy resource; photovoltaic system; quota system; renewable resource; subsidy system; Korea","Kwak, H.-Y.; Mechanical Engineering Department, Chung-Ang University, 84 Huksuk-Ro, Dongjak-Ku, Seoul 156-756, South Korea; email: kwakhy@cau.ac.kr",,,03014215,,ENPYA,,"English","Energy Policy",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84871429862

However, solar is an intermittent power source and households remain completely dependent on a ?less than green? electricity grid for reliable electricity. Further, much of the energy impact of PV occurs outside of the conventional boundaries of PV life-cycle analyses (LCA). This paper examines these competing observations and explores the broader impacts of a high penetration of household PV using Melbourne, Victoria as a reference. It concludes that in a grid dominated by unsequestered coal and gas, PV provides a legitimate source of emission abatement at high, but declining costs, with the potential for network and peak demand support. It may be technically possible to integrate a high penetration of PV, but the economic and energy cost of accommodating high-penetration PV erodes much of the benefits. Future developments in PV, storage, and integration technologies may allow PV to take on a greater long term role, but in the time horizon usually discussed in climate policy, a large-scale expansion of household PV may hinder rather than assist deep cuts to the emission intensity of Australia's electricity system. © 2013 by the authors.","Embodied energy; EROI; Greenhouse emissions; Peak demand; Solar PV","cost-benefit analysis; demand-side management; emission control; environmental management; greenhouse gas; life cycle analysis; photovoltaic system; power generation; production cost; renewable resource; residential energy; solar power; Australia; Melbourne; Victoria [Australia]","Palmer, G.; Paltech Corporation, 8 Kingston Park Court, Knoxfield, VIC 3180, Australia; email: graham@paltech.com.au",,"MDPI AG",20711050,,,,"English","Sustainability",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84883103340

We suggest that government decision-makers set a policy goal for the cumulated installed total quantity of grid-connected PV systems for a certain planning horizon. The objective of their mathematical programming is to minimize the system total average cost of feed-in tariffs (FITs) policy support and the learning investment per kilowatt (kW) PV system installed. In order to attain this goal, they must determine the appropriate FIT unit price and constant change rate that will stimulate residents of developing countries to install the PV systems rapidly. We also expect to achieve a learning effect through the accumulating experience in grid-connected PV systems that will reduce the system installed cost per kW each year. Our analysis reveals that the unit PV installed cost decreases with time and that the cost reduction is quite rapid when the change rate is large. To a certain extent, levering the magnitude of the change rate could affect the growth of the PV product life cycle. If governments in developing countries need to install a large quantity of PV systems at an early stage to reverse global warming or overcome the effects of climate change, then they must choose a higher change rate with a relatively larger initial FIT unit price to a FIT scheme. © 2013 Operational Research Society Ltd.","decision making; feed-in tariffs; grid-connected PV systems; learning curves; solar energy policy","Cost benefit analysis; Cost reduction; Decision making; Developing countries; Energy policy; Global warming; Investments; Life cycle; Mathematical programming; Solar energy; Analytic modeling; Feed-in tariff; Government decisions; Grid connected PV system; Learning curves; Learning effects; Marketing models; Planning horizons; Learning systems","Hsu, C.-W.; Graduate Institute of Management of Technology, Feng Chia University, No. 100, Wenhwa Rd., Seatwen, Taichung 40724, Taiwan; email: cwenhsu@fcu.edu.tw",,"Palgrave Macmillan Ltd.",01605682,,JORSD,,"English","J.Oper.Res.Soc.",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84881282119

Cost-effectiveness of emerging green technologies is a major factor that affects stakeholders' housing design decision-making on whether or not the innovations can be applied in practical terms. Based on the United Kingdom (UK) government's Standard Assessment Procedure (SAP) for energy rating of dwellings, this study conducted a comparative value assessment of 19 design alternatives set. The options also included ones that encompassed both electricity and heat generation potentials of PV applications-i.e., air-sourced PV thermal (PV/T) systems. Based on the SAP simulation results, it concluded that operational energy use and cost, as well as carbon dioxide (CO2) emission levels, can drastically be reduced particularly when a PV/T system is combined with a low-energy and high-performance mechanical ventilation with heat recovery (MVHR) system that can extract fresh air heated by PV.

The three mechanisms assessed are the net metering compensation scheme as proposed by the Brazilian Electricity Regulatory Agency (ANEEL), feed-in tariffs and direct subsidies to PV installations.

One promising approach to achieve FSC is to combine appropriate land use (compact city with energy efficient buildings and photovoltaic panels (PVs)), transportation (electric vehicles (EVs) and public transportation system) and energy systems (smart grid systems), because of the interaction between these elements. However, there are few models which simulate these elements in an integrated manner. This paper presents the concept of the integrated model, and shows the land use-energy part of the model created for the Tokyo metropolitan area, which is the largest Mega city in the world. Firstly, a spatially explicit land use model (urban economic model) is constructed for the study area, and the model is calibrated using existing statistical data. Secondly, possible future compact/dispersion city scenarios for the year 2050 are created using the model. Thirdly, intra-day dynamics (hourly) of electricity demand and supply from PVs, which is assumed to be installed to the roofs of all detached houses in the study area, under two urban scenarios is simulated. The obtained results suggest that [1] ""compact"" urban form may contribute to the reduction of electricity demand from the residential sector, but [2] PV-supply under the scenario may also be reduced because of the decreased share of detached houses. Hence in the compact city scenario, it is important to discuss the effective use of vacant areas in suburbs, which may be used for large PV installations, or be re-vegetated to mitigate urban heat island effects. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Compact city; Land use-transportation-energy model; Photovoltaic (PV); Smart city; Urban scenarios","Carbon dioxide; Economics; Electronic commerce; Energy efficiency; Heating; Land use; Photovoltaic cells; Compact city; Energy efficient building; Photovoltaic; Public transportation systems; Smart cities; Tokyo metropolitan areas; Urban Heat Island Effects; Urban scenarios; Urban transportation; carbon dioxide; demand analysis; electric vehicle; electricity supply; emission control; energy conservation; energy efficiency; heat island; installation; integrated approach; land use planning; megacity; photovoltaic system; public transport; revegetation; solar power; urban design; Honshu; Japan; Kanto; Tokyo [Kanto]","Yamagata, Y.; Center for Global Environmental Research, National Institute for Environmental Studies, Onogawa 16-2, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8506, Japan; email: yamagata@nies.go.jp",,"Elsevier Ltd",03062619,,APEND,,"English","Appl.

EMS is supposed to determine the optimal daily operation of energy appliances including energy storage factors economically and efficiently to satisfy user's desire taking account of forecasted energy demand and supply given by renewables such as PV. Energy demand forecast, being one of important factors to realize EMS, it is very difficult because building energy consumption structure is not elucidated sufficiently due to the variation of appliances and life styles. We need the information which kind of electricity demand has a likelihood of activation (shifted or reduced) for the forecast in EMS. Grasping energy consumption structure in a building contributes to not only demand forecast but also extraction of potential energy saving.

The city is perhaps best known for the development of two model sustainable urban districts, Rieselfeld and Vauban, both of which integrate multi-modal transportation linkages, ecological storm water management, low-energy passive solar houses, combined heating and power (CHP) systems, mixed uses (both public and private), local schools and a variety of shops to meet everyday needs, thus reducing greatly the need for private car ownership. The focus of this paper is on Vauban, a mixed-use district of some 5,100 residents, which has been built on the site of a former French military base. Unlike Rieselfeld and most other European sustainable urban districts, Vauban grew from the grass roots up and was largely designed and developed (within city guidelines and with technical assistance provided by the city) by many Baugruppen, small ecologically and socially progressive homeowner cooperatives organized under the auspices of the Vauban Forum. Members of each Baugruppe worked with their chosen architect to design their own apartments and housing blocks as well as their shared outdoor living spaces. The result is a community that is socially cohesive and architecturally diverse. Excellent light rail connections to all of Freiburg, as well as car sharing clubs and extensive walking and bicycle paths, offer Vauban residents everything they need for everyday life without owning a car. In addition to pioneering new patterns of user-developed ecological urban design, Vauban also has been a leader in setting new lowenergy standards for buildings in Freiburg as well as for the rest of Germany. Based on a review of the literature, interviews with selected architects and residents as well as on-site observations by the author, this paper presents a comprehensive description of Vauban as a successful example of participatory design and development, as well as social, economic, architectural and technological sustainability. © 2013 WIT Press.","Baugruppen; Biophilic design; Car-free' living; Carbon neutral building design; Child-friendly urbanism; Combined heat and power systems; Design for social diversity; Ecological storm water management; Participatory planning; Passivhaus and Plusenergie® housing; Solar photovoltaics; Sustainable urban design","Ecology; Heating; Housing; Multimodal transportation; Power generation; Regional planning; Storms; Water management; Baugruppen; Building design; Car-free' living; Child-friendly urbanism; Combined heat and power system; Participatory planning; Solar photovoltaics; Storm-water managements; Sustainable urban designs; Architectural design","Coates, G.J.; School of Architecture, Kansas State UniversityUnited States",,"WITPress",17557437,,,,"English","Int.

Others are linked to the political stage, where the necessary support schemes have to be in place in combination with clear political objectives on the design of the future energy system. This article takes the point of departure in the existing support schemes, most common ownership structures, energy prices, electricity demand and heating demand in Denmark, France and Portugal. For the three countries, we analyse different constellations of operational strategies, ownership structures and promotion schemes and assess the necessary support levels for residential fuel cells under these constellations. We find that the necessary support levels are not excessively high compared to the initial support levels for e.g. photovoltaic systems in Germany. Especially net metering in Denmark and price premiums for fuel cells functioning as a virtual power plant in France and Portugal seems promising. The annual number of operation hours depends strongly on the operational scheme. For thermal-led units, cold start and modulation capacity plays a certain role, whereas the fuel cell generates virtually permanently if it is part of a virtual power plant. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

This study seeks to study the impact of the transition from Compact Fluorescent Lamp (CFL) to Light Emitting Diodes based lights (LED) on the solar home lighting system market. Changing the lighting fixtures from CFL to LED would lead to the requirement of smaller panels and batteries and consequently, a reduction in prices. Would this reduction significantly increase the adoption of these systems? Would the requirement for financing or government support change? To understand this changing landscape of the rural solar lighting industry, this study analyses the current products, distribution network, and operations of seven diverse solar firms operating in different parts of India. Four of these firms exclusively make LED based products - lanterns and small home lighting systems - and the rest have some LED based systems in their portfolio. There are several factors to be considered, product configuration, luminosity, price effects and service and maintenance. While the price reduction is found to be significant (about 20%), affordability may still remain an issue for poorer households.

This study examines the performance and level of energy savings by simulating a detached home in four climates with RSC, cross-ventilation, and standard ventilation strategies. Each case was simulated in ESP-r for baseline and high efficiency construction, detached homes with a single story, three bedrooms, a 189m2 floor plan and high thermal mass constructions. Photovoltaic panels were integrated into the surface of the solar chimney on the South-facing roof to improve the RSC performance with their absorptive properties, and provide cooling to the reverse of the panels with the ventilation airflow. To form the RSC, a gap under the external layer of the roof allowed airflow from the interior of the house to a plenum in the peak of the attic with vents to the outside. Cross ventilation was aided with openings in the interior walls allowing flow between rooms. The ventilation gap was modeled by discretizing the RSC into 12 sections and calibrating the air-flow and convection coefficients with corresponding computational fluid dynamics models. The results indicate that the ventilated roof provides free cooling and natural ventilation in all climates and seasons tested. Flow was caused more by the stack effect rather than through natural convection and the solar chimney effect. Cross ventilation reduced cooling load by approximately 50% percent over the baseline, and the ventilated roof by up to another 80%. Either advanced natural ventilation approach reduced cooling load by more than the green envelope and efficiency practices in three of the four climates. The natural ventilation techniques were proportionally as effective in reducing load in a high efficiency home as in the base case home. © 2013.","Building energy modeling; Green building; Natural ventilation; Passive cooling; Solar chimney; Ventilated roof","Air conditioning; Computational fluid dynamics; Energy conservation; Energy utilization; Photovoltaic cells; Roofs; Solar chimneys; Building energy modeling; Green buildings; Natural ventilation; Passive cooling; Ventilated roofs; Ventilation; airflow; baseline conditions; building; calibration; cooling; cost-benefit analysis; ventilation","DeBlois, J.; University of Pittsburgh, Department of Mechanical Engineering, 3700 O'Hara St., Pittsburgh, PA 15260, United States; email: jcd34@pitt.edu",,"Elsevier Ltd",03062619,,APEND,,"English","Appl.

The developments of batteries, both for electric vehicles (EV) and for stationary storage might lead to a mass market for those batteries. In this paper we evaluate the economy of stationary battery storage with photovoltaic system at home in the context of available EV and its integration level into the home. Therefore, we use an optimization model with one year detailed operation planning and maximize the net present value of the storage investment. We integrate restriction functions for the technical parameters of the storage systems and limit EV availability and usage on the basis of German mobility studies for single vehicles. The results show, that an investment in a stationary battery system in combination with a photovoltaic system is profitable in Germany under the assumptions considered. The observed high numbers of battery cycles lead to strong requirements for battery lifetime, i. e. cycle stability and long calendar life time. Therewith, Li-ion batteries are a promising technology. In combination with an EV, the net present value of the stationary battery system is smaller when the EV is integrated into the home by controlled charging or the vehicle to home (V2H) concept, which allows discharging into the home system. The size of the EV battery, the availability at daytime and the load curve of the home are the main influencing factors for the profitability of the battery system. © 2013 WEVA Page.","Energy storage; EV; Load management; Optimization model; Photovoltaik","Electric load management; Electric vehicles; Energy storage; Investments; Optimization; Photovoltaic cells; Profitability; Controlled charging; Decentralized power generations; Integration levels; Operation planning; Optimization modeling; Photovoltaic systems; Photovoltaik; Stationary batteries; Lithium-ion batteries","Kaschub, T.; Institute for Industrial Production (IIP), Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) (University of Karlsruhe), Building 06.33, Hertzstr. 16, Germany; email: kaschub@kit.edu",,"AVERE",20326653,,,,"English","World Electr.

More than 90% of the country's primary energy comes from fossil fuels leading to an unsustainable per capita carbon footprint of about 9 tCO2e. Previous research has shown that photovoltaics can significantly augment the constrained fossil fuel generated electricity supply. This paper discusses the practical application of photovoltaics as a building element in energy efficient residential housing. The study also aims to determine the feasibility of implementing BIPV systems in the residential sector in South Africa. An energy efficient solar house was designed using simulation software and constructed. Ordinary solar panels were integrated onto the north facing roof of the house. A data acquisition system that monitors meteorological conditions and BIPV output was installed. It was observed that elevated back of module temperatures reaching up to 75°C on sunny days decreased module efficiency by up to 20% in the afternoon.

The program is implemented by the Department of Energy (DoEF) and although initially designed on the RESCO model, the program as currently implemented is based on a partial RESCO approach as the government rather than a service company has full responsibility for program delivery. Donor-supplied capital is used for the initial equipment purchase and installation costs and all equipment and components supplied and installed under the program are owned by the government. A survey of both SHS users and those involved in the program design, planning and implementation was undertaken in order to obtain a better understanding on the Fijian SHS program, the approach used, the delivery method, the policy framework within which it is implemented and the overall the effectiveness of the program. This, in turn, helps to understand how SHS programs being implemented elsewhere can be improved. The main survey finding was that the effectiveness of the implementation of the Fijian SHS program is seen by many stakeholders to suffer from a lack of well developed planning and policy support. This manifests itself in a lack of support infrastructure and in a weak monitoring and maintenance program, which in turn give rise to significant technical problems. Many stakeholders consider there to be significant capacity for increasing the effectiveness of the program by the development of a more comprehensive and robust monitoring system, the provision of quality post-installation services, and the use of higher quality components.

The analysis comprises three different interest rate scenarios reflecting different conditions for capital acquisition to finance the generators; subsidized, mature market and country-specific risk-adjusted interest. In the NPV analysis, revenue flow is modeled by the sale of PV electricity at current residential tariffs assuming net metering. Using subsidized interest rates, the analysis shows that solar PV electricity is already competitive in Brazil, while in the country-specific risk-adjusted rate, the declining, but still high capital costs of PV make it economically unfeasible.

Results are based on three municipal energy plans developed for urban areas located in Marche Region with a number of inhabitants ranging from 5,000 to 100,000. Different aspects of municipal energy management connected to urban size have been investigated. The public administration role has been analyzed in detail in order to identify the determinant factors for municipal energy market involvement. Various opportunities and measures can be undertaken by municipalities to steer the energy system in the right direction, such as building codes, administration simplification, information campaigns and pilot projects aimed at reducing the public administration expenditure and also driving changes in the private sectors. The following barriers to municipal energy market participation have been identified: i) rules of municipal budgeting with debt limit, ii) difficult access to non-budgetary sources and iii) lack of human resources dedicated to energy-related issues. Several energy-saving measures have been analyzed for both public and private sectors such as: i) thermal insulation and introduction of photovoltaic (PV) power generation in schools, ii) introduction of micro-combined heat and power (CHP) system as well as geothermal energy in residential sector, iii) CHP systems in the industry sector. Factors suitable for the analysis of urban areas characterized by similar parameters (climate condition, urban density, socio-economic indexes) have been found out. Results reveal that an efficient local energy planning is able to achieve, at least, a 10% reduction of the energy demand, thus helping the achievement of the ambitious EU's 2020 targets. In particular, the main contribution is expected to come from low-carbon measures in the industry and residential sector. © 2012 WIT Press.","Energy policy; Energy savings; Micro-CHP; Municipal planning; Renewable","Climate change mitigation; Energy-saving measures; Micro-CHP; Micro-combined heat and power; Municipal energy management; Municipal planning; Public and private sector; Renewable; Budget control; Building codes; Commerce; Economics; Emission control; Energy conservation; Energy management; Energy policy; Geothermal energy; Greenhouse gases; Power generation; Public administration; Urban planning; Investments; economic analysis; energy market; energy planning; energy policy; energy use; local planning; parameterization; private sector; project assessment; public administration; Italy; Marche; Chandipura virus","Brandoni, C.; Università Telematica E-CAMPUSItaly",,,17437601,,,,"English","Int.

This study aims to investigate the economic, technical and environmental performance of residential PV system running under the Queensland (Australia) climatic conditions, and optimize the size and slope of PV array in the system. The solar irradiation data of the 4 typical climate zones of Queensland, including tropical, sub-tropical, hot arid, and warm temperature zone, are investigated. Using global solar irradiation as solar energy resource data, the price of PV devices, batteries, converters, and grid electricity tariff and sale-back tariff as economic analysis inputs, the system is simulated and optimized by HOMER software. The optimized system not only satisfies the typical residential load of 23 kWh per day but also meets the requirement of minimizing the total costs of system investment and electricity consumption during the system's lifetime. It is found that under the specific climatic conditions of the eleven main cities of Queensland, a PV system is an effective way to decrease electricity bills and mitigate carbon dioxide emission. In particular, a 6 kW PV system in Townsville is able to deal with 61% of the total electricity load and conserves more than 90% of electricity payments and reduce approximately 95% of carbon dioxide emission.

For a location, meteorological and load data have been collected and assessed. Then, modelling and primary energy analysis have been achieved for all components of the hybrid system. Finally, an optimal configuration has been carried out using a dynamic model and applying two different algorithms with single and multi-objective optimisation. The methodology has been performed successfully for the sizing of a wind-PV-batteries system to supply at least 95 of the yearly total electric demand of a residential house.

This is seen as a cost effective solution in contrast to extending the utility grid in remote areas. The types of upcoming renewable and low-carbon generation technologies are being preferred for such systems depending on their availability and economic viability in these countries. Moreover, HPSs are also being preferred in order to improve the overall energy efficiency of the system and to get a judicious generation mix which would minimise the operating cost of the system. Rural communities in South Africa endure poor access to electricity mostly due to the lack of grid connected power lines. It is therefore the ideal place to conduct a study on the economic feasibility of introducing HPSs for typical residential loads for the rural community in South Africa.

One of the most attractive applications of RE technology is the application of hybrid energy systems in remote areas. An alternative to overcoming the intermittence of RE sources, such as the sun and wind (are freely available and environmental friendly), is to develop the hybrid energy system where excess electrical energy could be converted and stored.

Design/methodology/approach: Electricity plays a crucial role in the development and use of ICT and in the process of striving to achieve sustainable development in emerging economies. It has been shown that electrical energy is intrinsically linked to economic, environmental and social dimensions of sustainable development. An extensive analysis of the major contribution of solar electricity in various sectors such as economic, social and environmental benefits is provided. The paper concludes with a discussion on current status of solar electricity in major emerging economies, their planning policies and strategies for promoting solar power generation for increased access to ICT by people and sustainable development of society. Findings: The demand for electricity in residential, commercial and industrial sectors in developing countries (emerging economies) is likely to increase, both as a result of increase in population and expanding industrialization. It remains amongst others, a growing challenge for these nations to obtain and put in place reliable and secured electricity supplies, for accessing ICT and to work towards achieving sustainability. The important issues that must be considered and addressed for the successful implementation of solar electricity programs for sustainability and wellbeing in developing nations are pointed out.Practical implications: The paper shows that the problems of lack of qualified solar technicians and established Photovoltaic (PV) markets and business modes, renewable (solar) energy education have to be addressed. Other issues include appreciation of solar electricity as one of the major energy component, lowering initial cost of the PV technology, availability of finance mechanisms for customers, import tax exemption and regarding electricity as one of the basic needs like food, shelter and clothing. Overhaul of existing systems needs to take place in order to provide the means to deal with some of these issues. Originality/value: Availability of power remains crucial for development in emerging markets. Solar electricity is of major interest for the energy sector in developing or emerging economies because it offers the possibility of generating renewable electricity using sunlight - a resource that is widely and freely available in most, if not all, developing countries. This paper raises awareness about this in a unique way and identifies problems faced by the sectors. To address some of these challenges without compromising the goal of sustainability and development, it is important that low carbon emitting electrical energy sources such as solar electricity are given high priorities by policy makers, industries and research and development institutions in emerging countries.

Europe leads the PV market while the US lags behind. While the feed-in tariff (FIT) mechanism, a performance-based solar energy incentive scheme, is popular in Europe, the US has been devising capacity-based incentive programs. A capacity-based incentive scheme includes tax credits, state and local rebate programs, and even property tax credits. It helps in reducing the large, upfront cost which is considered as one of the barriers of quickly deploying solar photovoltaic (PV) systems in the US and in some high solar resource states. The other concern is the aggregate unit price which is a measure in evaluating the investment of solar PV systems. The study applies the life cycle cost analysis method to analyze the feasibility and affordability of deploying residential PV systems in the United States, especially Florida. It helps potential users to determine the most economical PV system, in terms of upfront cost and aggregate unit cost, based on household income, incentive rebate programs, and the efficiency of the PV system.

From the perspective of residential customers, we can investigate how to minimize the expected electricity cost with real-time electricity pricing, which is the focus of this paper. By jointly considering energy storage, local distributed generation such as photovoltaic (PV) modules or small wind turbines, and inelastic or elastic energy demands, we mathematically formulate this problem as a stochastic optimization problem and approximately solve it by using the Lyapunov optimization approach. From the theoretical analysis, we have also found a good tradeoff between cost saving and storage capacity. A salient feature of our proposed approach is that it can operate without any future knowledge on the related stochastic models (e.g., the distribution) and is easy to implement in real time.

A survey was conducted to understand consumer perceptions of the technology (perception variables), such as perceived cost, perceived maintenance requirement, and environmental concern. To further investigate the adoption potential of residential PV, this paper develops a fuzzy logic inference model to relate consumer perception variables (inputs to the model) to their purchasing probability (output from the model). This model is tested in a case study of residential PV adoption using data from a survey of homeowners in Arizona, United States. The quantitative results of the model demonstrate the role of each perception variable in the consumer acceptance of PV.

Starting from a base case study that assumes mass production in Ontario, it is shown that the investment in such a system, making use of a heat engine and having 9m 2 of aperture area, could be about CN$10000 for a peak electrical efficiency of 18% and thermal efficiency of 75%. The average CO 2 mitigation due to combined savings in electricity and heat is ∼0.3kgCO 2kWh -1, a figure 3-4 times larger than for photovoltaic panels. If 25% government subsidy to the investment is provided, the payback period becomes 21.6 years. Additionally, if the financing benefits from a feed-in-tariff program (at 25% electrical sell-back to the grid) and deductions from CO 2 tax are realized, then the payback time drops to 11.3 years. These results are obtained for a conservative scenario of 5.5% annual incremental increase in energy price. For the moderate consideration of all factors, it is shown that within the financial savings over the entire lifecycle, 7% are due to carbon tax, 30% are due to electrical production and the largest amount, 63%, is the result of reducing the natural gas heating capacity with solar heating from the proposed system. © 2011 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.","Dish; Economics; Efficiency; Energy; Exergy; Heat engine; Solar energy","Aperture area; Carbon taxes; Dish; Electrical efficiency; Energy; Energy prices; Financial savings; Government subsidies; Mass production; Ontario; Payback periods; Payback time; Photovoltaic panels; Residential application; Solar-driven heat engine; Thermal efficiency; Economic analysis; Economics; Efficiency; Exergy; Heat engines; Investments; Photovoltaic effects; Solar energy; Carbon dioxide","Zamfirescu, C.; Faculty of Engineering and Applied Science, University of Ontario Institute of Technology, 2000 Simcoe Street North, Oshawa, ON, L1H 7K4, Canada; email: calinzam@gmail.com",,,0363907X,,IJERD,,"English","Int.

Energy storage devices are generally used to smooth variations in DG's MW output due to inherent unpredictability and to minimize exchange of power from grid. Connecting the storage and DGs to the grid have both technical and economic impacts. This paper aims at analyzing the technical and economic impacts of distributed generators along with energy storage devices on the distribution system. The technical analysis includes analyzing the transient stability of a system with DGs and energy storage devices, such as a battery and ultracapacitor. The DGs are represented by small synchronous and induction generators. Different types and locations of faults and different penetration levels of the DGs are considered in the analysis. Energy storage devices are found to have a positive impact on transient stability. For economic analysis, the costs of the system with different DG technologies and energy storage devices are compared using the software tool hybrid optimization model for electric renewables (HOMER). Finally, the analysis for cost versus benefits of DGs and energy storage devices is compared briefly. © 2011 IEEE.","Batteries; distributed generation; energy storage devices; power system transient stability; system economics; ultracapacitors","DG technology; Distributed generations; Distributed generators; Distribution systems; Economic impacts; Electric grids; Hybrid optimization; MW output; Penetration level; Photovoltaics; power system transient stability; Renewables; Software tool; Technical analysis; Ultracapacitors; Wind generators; Asynchronous generators; Capacitors; Civil aviation; Cost benefit analysis; Distributed power generation; Economic analysis; Economic and social effects; Electric utilities; Energy storage; Land vehicle propulsion; Solar cells; Wind power; Virtual storage","Srivastava, A.K.; School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Washington State University, Pullman, WA 99164, United States; email: asrivast@eecs.wsu.edu",,,19328184,,,,"English","IEEE Syst.

To address this issue, a consortium was formed between the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, Pulte Homes, and NV Energy. An energy efficient residential community was developed by the team in Las Vegas with approximately 200 homes to study substation-level peak reduction strategies. A summer peak reduction of more than 65%, between 1:00PM and 7:00PM, compared to code standard housing developments is the targeted goal of the project. Approximately 50 homes are already built and some are occupied. The energy performances of the homes have been monitored and are presented in this paper. Several peak electric load reduction strategies such as energy efficiency in buildings, roof integrated photovoltaics (PV) and direct load control have been applied. Though all the homes in the developed community are installed with 1.8kWp PV systems, the orientation of the PV system depends on the building orientation. Focus of this paper is to find the impact of PV orientation on the peak load from a building. In addition, different time-of-use (TOU) energy pricing options are offered by the local electrical utility company. Hence it is important to find an optimal pricing option for each building. A computer model has been developed for one of the homes in the new development using building energy simulation code, ENERGY-10. Calculations on the PV orientations have shown that a south and 220° (i.e. 40° west of due south) orientations are economically optimal for homes enrolled to flat electricity pricing schedule and time of use pricing respectively. As predicted by the simulations, the energy efficiency methods in the home have decreased the total annual energy by 38% compared to a code standard home of the same size. Further, the energy efficiency methods in the building coupled with a 220° oriented PV and 1.1°C increase in thermostat temperature for three hours (from 3:00 to 6:00PM) reduced the peak energy demand by 62% compared to a code standard building of the same size. Battery storage is the other option that will be considered in the project at a later time which is expected to carry the project well beyond its peak reduction goals. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Building energy; Energy efficiency; Energy efficient buildings; Peak electric demand; Peak saving; PV orientation","Building codes; Codes (symbols); Computer simulation; Costs; Electricity; Energy management; Housing; Optimization; Photovoltaic effects; Roofs; Standards; Battery storage; Building energy; Building energy simulations; Building orientation; Computer models; Direct load control; Electric demand; Electrical utilities; Electricity pricing; Energy efficiency in buildings; Energy efficient; Energy efficient building; Energy performance; Energy pricing; Energy-efficiency method; Housing development; Las Vegas; Peak demand; Peak electric loads; Peak electricity demand; Peak energy demand; Peak load; Peak saving; Photovoltaics; PV system; Reduction strategy; Residential communities; Residential electricity; Summer temperature; Time-of-use pricing; University of Nevada; Energy efficiency; computer simulation; demand analysis; desert; electricity industry; electricity supply; energy conservation; energy efficiency; installation; integrated approach; performance assessment; photovoltaic system; pricing policy; resident population; residential energy; roof; United States","Sadineni, S.B.; Center for Energy Research, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering, University of Nevada, Las Vegas, 4505 Maryland Parkway, Las Vegas, NV 89154-4027, United States; email: sbsadineni@yahoo.com",,"Elsevier Ltd",03062619,,APEND,,"English","Appl.

The major residential energy consumption in these regions is for cooking. This energy demand is covered by firewood, agricultural residues and/or animal dung, implying often exhausting work for the collection and causing deforestation. Solar thermal cooking systems have been developed and promoted, although their success has been limited. This paper follows another solar cooking approach by evaluating the option of combining an off-grid PV system (PV generator+battery) with very low demand electric cooking appliances. The PV-battery system to supply the load demand for the electric cooking appliances for communities of 50 persons has been calculated. Thereby, the five countries with the highest population without access to electricity have been taken into account: India, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Nigeria.

To achieve this, a new approach is needed which accounts for the interdependencies between the different supply technologies as well as consumption profiles of residents and on-site energy resource availability.

Markets for RE technologies are emerging in Nepal as a consequence of increasing rural electrification in the country. Two promising technologies are in evidence - solar home systems (SHS) and micro hydro. The availability of abundant renewable resources, lack of fossil fuels and difficult geographical terrain for grid extensions contribute to the advantages of RE-based decentralized rural electrification in Nepal.

The system characteristics were studied in terms of optimal configuration, net present cost and the cost of energy. An entirely renewable energy-based configuration is feasible if 10% annual capacity shortage is allowed, while for a scenario with no capacity shortage, addition of a diesel generator is necessary. The addition of renewable energy components results in greenhouse gas reduction which could be used for carbon trading. © 2012 Lal and Raturi; licensee Springer.","Fiji islands; HOMER; Hybrid mini-grid system",,"Raturi, A.; School of Engineering and Physics, University of the South Pacific, Suva, Fiji; email: raturi_a@usp.ac.fj",,"Springer Verlag",20089163,,,,"English","Int.

The cogeneration (CHP) and the on-site generation (also known as distributed generation) could be the key strategy to achieve this goal; CHP systems allow to reduce the fuel consumption and pollutant emissions (in particular the greenhouse gases) compared to separate generation; moreover on-site-generation contributes to the reduction of the energy which is lost in electricity transmission, and increases the security in the energy supply. In this scenario the Thermo-Photo-Voltaic generation (TPV) is obtaining an increasing attention; TPV is a system to convert into electrical energy the radiation emitted from an artificial heat source (i.e. the combustion of fuel) by the use of photovoltaic cells.A domestic gas furnace based on this technology can provide the entire thermal need of an apartment and can also contributes to satisfy the electrical demand.The aim of this study is the understanding of the behavior of a TPV in CHP application in case of residential buildings, under both the energetic and economical point of view; in particular a parametrical analysis is developed and discussed varying the TPV electrical efficiency, the thermal request and the apartment typology. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Cogeneration; Distributed generation; Feasibility study; Thermo-Photo-Voltaic generator","Apartment houses; Buildings; Distributed power generation; Fuels; Greenhouse gases; Photovoltaic effects; Planning; CHP-systems; Cogeneration; Electrical efficiency; Electrical energy; Electricity transmission; Energy supplies; Feasibility studies; Growing demand; Heat sources; Onsite generation; Photovoltaic; Pollutant emission; Primary energies; Residential building; Thermo-Photo-Voltaic generator; Electric generators; combined heat and power; combustion; demand analysis; energy efficiency; environmental economics; environmental impact; feasibility study; fuel consumption; greenhouse gas; heat source; parameterization; photovoltaic system; residential energy; typology; Chandipura virus; Pepper golden mosaic virus - [Mexico]","Melino, F.; IMEM - CNR, Parco Area delle Scienze 37/A, 43124 Parma, Italy; email: francesco.melino@imem.cnr.it",,"Elsevier Ltd",03062619,,APEND,,"English","Appl.

To investigate the awareness of renewable energy policies and incentives, a preliminary survey of the public opinion in Malaysia has been carried out, and an evaluation of public willingness to invest in the FiT scheme by installing the PV on their houses is presented. The cost-benefit analysis shows that the proposed FiT programme is capable of generating good return on investment as compared to the one in the UK, but the return is lower than other investment tools.

A model home developed in Las Vegas was used to calibrate the numerical model and was considered as a basis for further study. The validated building models were then used to predict the annual energy savings and payback periods for various upgrades. In all cases, comparisons were made to code-built houses with the same general overall characteristics. Useful life of most of these upgrades far exceeds their payback periods. It is found that a typical house, with the cost-effective upgrades installed, consumed 42.5% less annual energy compared to a home built to code.

Providing these households with electricity by extending the country's already overloaded grids is neither an economically nor a technically feasible option. Rural electrification strategies therefore, by necessity, need to rely on stand-alone generation systems. One of these is solar home systems (SHS) and the SHS program developed and implemented in Bangladesh has been highly successful, with very large numbers of rural households now participating in the program. What makes the program's success most remarkable is the fact that it targets households with very low incomes using a purely market-based approach. Those participating in the program pay the full, unsubsidised cost of their SHS using a micro-credit loan facility and are charged high interest rates. Understanding the reasons behind the success of the Bangladeshi program therefore holds potentially valuable lessons for SHS programs being implemented in other developing countries. A comprehensive qualitative and quantitative survey was used to find those factors perceived by program stakeholders as being most critical to the program's success to date and the factors considered most likely to impact on its future success. The two primary reasons for the program's success were perceived to be its strong focus on meeting householders' needs and on its ability to make the solar home systems as affordable as possible. The continued success of the program was considered likely to be determined by a variety of factors, including the ability of program implementers to control increases in the cost of SHS, to maintain the quality of SHS and components and to increase program loan recovery rates, the degree to which the program is integrated into national, energy policy, and the degree to which local banks become involved in the program. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Bangladesh; Micro-credit; SHS; Solar PV; Successfulness","Bangladesh; Micro-credit; SHS; Solar PVs; Successfulness; Developing countries; Electric utilities; Energy policy; Rural areas; Solar buildings; cost-benefit analysis; developing world; electricity generation; environmental factor; household income; integrated approach; participatory approach; policy making; qualitative analysis; quantitative analysis; rural area; stakeholder; survey; sustainability; Bangladesh","Urmee, T.; Murdoch University, Energy Studies, School of Engineering and Energy, Faculty Science and Engineering, Perth 6150, Australia; email: t.urmee@murdoch.edu.au",,,09601481,,,,"English","Renew.

First, the present paper examined the extent to which residential PV system users understand specification, reliability, and failure risk of their own systems. Second, causal factors affecting users' satisfaction with PV systems were examined. By analyzing data collected in Kakegawa City, this paper revealed that users did not appropriately understand the basic specifications of their residential PV systems, and in particular, the fact that the systems sometimes failed and therefore needed proper maintenance. Furthermore, a strong causal relationship between users' expectations of financial return from the system and their level of satisfaction was confirmed empirically. These results suggested that excessive focus on profitability and relatively low interest in the systems' reliability and failure risk should be addressed more to avoid problems that could potentially hamper the establishment of this technology into society. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Ordered logit analysis; Perception; Residential PV system","Causal relationships; Failure risk; Financial returns; Level of satisfaction; Ordered logit analysis; PV system; Users' perception; Photovoltaic effects; Profitability; Reliability analysis; Specifications; Risk perception; alternative energy; empirical analysis; logit analysis; maintenance; photovoltaic system; profitability; renewable resource; residential energy; risk perception; urban area; Chubu; Honshu; Japan; Kakegawa; Shizuoka [Chubu]","Mukai, T.; Department of International Development Engineering, Tokyo Institute of Technology, 2-12-1-I4-4, Ookayama, Meguro-ku, Tokyo 152-8550, Japan; email: mukai@ide.titech.ac.jp",,,03014215,,ENPYA,,"English","Energy Policy",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-79960747367

This study examines whether the integration of the photovoltaic (PV) into individual residential buildings in the GCC countries is worth the investment. A prototype residential building is developed and a building integrated photovoltaic (BiPV) system is then designed. The system performance is simulated, and through economic analysis, it is shown that the current BiPV technology is not a cost-effective option for the GCC countries based on the present electricity tariff, PV system cost and system efficiency. The only way such a system would be viable with current technology is if the electricity tariff were to increase substantially. However, if the tariff remains constant for the foreseeable future, BiPV solar energy technology will only be feasible if the total system cost drops drastically. This study shows that BiPV systems offer cost reductions in both energy and economic terms over centralised PV plants, especially if the costs of avoided building construction materials are taken into account. To bring about the benefits of BiPV technology for the GCC residential sector, therefore, the first logical and most practical step is the implementation of a continuous promotion strategy that consists of both subsidies for investments and reasonable tariffs. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","BiPV; Economic assessment; GCC countries","BiPV; Building construction; Building integrated photovoltaic; Current technology; Decentralised; Economic assessment; Electricity tariff; Energy technologies; GCC countries; Gulf region; Natural potential; Promotion strategies; PV plants; PV system; Residential building; Residential sectors; System costs; System efficiency; Apartment houses; Building materials; Cost reduction; Economic analysis; Energy efficiency; Investments; Photovoltaic effects; Power quality; Solar energy; Solar radiation; Technology; Cost benefit analysis; cost-benefit analysis; decentralization; economic analysis; electricity generation; energy efficiency; integrated approach; photovoltaic system; solar power","Radhi, H.; Architectural Engineering Department, UAE University, P.O Box 17555, Al-Ain, United Arab Emirates; email: h_radhi@uaeu.ac.ae",,,03014215,,ENPYA,,"English","Energy Policy",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-79952312737

Energy is estimated for a typical commercial poultry house, and a system is then designed to satisfy the load demand. As hybrid Optimization Model for Electric Renewable (HOMER) software is used for the simulation of four respective cases: Diesel only, photovoltaic (PV)-diesel-battery, wind-diesel-battery and photovoltaic-wind-diesel-battery. We also evaluate the cost, environmental advantages and benefit of the demand-side management (DSM) when renewable hybrid energy options are applied to the poultry farming. By implementing light control system and high-efficiency fans (with about 20% efficiency increase), annual electricity consumptions can be reduced by 15% with DSM. When DSM was applied to the cost of energy, certain parameters including unmet electric load, excess electricity and greenhouse gas emissions are calculated for each case. Greenhouse gas emissions are also investigated for the hybrid energy system (by integrating PV and wind turbine only into diesel system). The hybrid system thus reduces CO2 emissions from 21.8 to 10t, particulate matter (PM) from 4.1 to 1.9 kg, NOx from 0.421 to 0.221t. A break-even analysis is performed to decide the optimum distance where the hybrid energy system is more economical than the extension of the transmission line. Consequently, the results indicate that installation of the hybrid energy system is more economical than the conventional electricity network when the distance is more than 3.21 and 3.13 km for PV-wind-diesel-battery and wind-diesel-battery, respectively. © The Author 2010.

It is believed in the energy community that a technology similar to photovoltaics, but offered at about $1/W, would lead to widespread deployment at residential and commercial sites. This paper addresses the feasibility study of a low-cost solar-thermal electricity generation technology, suitable for distributed deployment. Specifically, we discuss a system based on nonimaging solar concentrators, integrated with free-piston Stirling engine devices incorporating integrated electric generation. We target concentrator collector operation at moderate temperatures, in the range of 120°C to 150°C. This temperature range is consistent with the use of optical concentrators with low-concentration ratios, wide angles of radiation acceptance which are compatible with no diurnal tracking and no or only a few seasonal adjustments. Therefore, costs and reliability hazards associated with tracking hardware systems are avoided. This paper further outlines the design, fabrication, and test results of a single-phase free-piston Stirling engine prototype. A very low loss resonant displacer piston is designed for the system using a very linear magnetic spring. The power piston, which is not mechanically linked to the displacer piston, forms a mass-spring resonating subsystem with the gas spring, and has a resonant frequency matched to that of the displacer. The design of heat exchangers is discussed, with an emphasis on their low fluid friction losses. Only standard low-cost materials and manufacturing methods are required to realize such a machine. The fabricated engine prototype is successfully tested as an engine, and the experimental results are presented and discussed.

The configuration of optimal hybrid system is selected based on the best components and sizing with appropriate operating strategy to provide a cheap, efficient, reliable and cost-effective system. The various renewable energy sources and their applicability in terms of cost and performance are analyzed. Moreover, the annual yield and cost of energy production of solar and wind energy are evaluated. The Simulations were carried out using the HOMER program based on data obtained from the Malaysian Meteorological Centre.

Hence, it is vital to select an appropriate size of the system in order to reduce the cost and excess energy produced as well as to maximize the available resources. The sizing of hybrid system must satisfy the LPSP (Loss of Power Supply Probability) which determines the ability of the system to meet the load requirements. Once the lowest configurations are determined, the cost of the system must then be taken into consideration to determine the system with the lowest cost. The optimization methodology proposed in this paper uses the ANFIS (Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System) to model the PV and wind sources. The algorithm developed is compared to HOMER (Hybrid Optimization Model for Electric Renewables) and HOGA (Hybrid Optimization by Genetic Algorithms) software and the results demonstrate an accuracy of 96% for PV and wind.

This formulation is carried out with the purpose of arriving at a selection of the system economical components that can reliably satisfy the load demand. Genetic algorithm (GA) optimization technique is utilized to satisfy two purposes. The first is to minimize the formulated objective function, which is the total cost of the proposed hybrid system. Whereas, the second is to ensure that the load is served according to certain reliability criteria, by maintaining the loss of power supply probability (LPSP) of the system lower than a certain predetermined value. Two computer programs are designed, using MATLAB code in a two M-files, to simulate the proposed hybrid system and to formulate the optimization problem by computing the coefficients of the objective function and the constraints. Also, these two programs are utilized together with the GA tool under MATLAB software to yield the optimum PV, wind, and battery ratings. The results verified that PV-wind hybrid systems feature lower system cost compared to the cases where either PV-alone or wind-alone systems are used.

Currently, electricity is mainly generated from imported gas and coal due to a lack of indigenous fossil fuel resources in Ireland. Solar energy is omnipresent, freely available and environmental friendly. The utilisation of solar energy to produce electricity has become increasingly attractive worldwide. However, solar electricity generation has not been very popular in Ireland to-date either on a large scale or on a domestic scale. The unclear economics of domestic solar PV systems, under Irish conditions, is considered the biggest obstacle for expanding domestic solar PV system installation in Ireland. This paper presents a methodology to accurately evaluate the economic viability of a domestic solar PV system on a case-by-case basis. The methodology utilises the software programmes HOMER and Microsoft Excel 2007 for the energy and economic analyses. Utilising this methodology, a realistic economic analysis of eight sample domestic solar PV systems available in Ireland is presented. Based on the predictions, the domestic solar PV system is not economically viable under current conditions in Ireland.

However, the Net ZEB concept raises a new issue: how far should we go with energy efficiency measures and when should we start to apply renewable energy technologies? This analysis adopts the LCC methodology and uses a multi-family Net ZEB to find the answer to this question. Moreover, it looks at the issue from the building owner's perspective, hence it should be seen as a private economy analysis. The study includes three levels of energy demand and three alternatives of energy supply systems: (1) photovoltaic installation with photovoltaic/solar thermal collectors and an ambient air/solar source heat pump; (2) photovoltaic installation with a ground-source heat pump; (3) photovoltaic installation with district heating grid. The results indicate that in order to build a cost-effective Net ZEB, the energy use should be reduced to a minimum leaving just a small amount of left energy use to be covered by renewable energy generation.

Using micro-credit institutions in the energy sector or implementing small utilities with a fee-for-service model is now considered as two desirable options to create a dynamic self-sustained market for solar home systems.South Africa launched in 1999 an ambitious off-grid solar electrification programme with fee-for-service concessions.

The standalone SPV home lighting system has increasingly been popular among rural households, while SPV mini-grid supply system is being promoted for rural electrification schemes. This study uses data from household survey to explore the impact of household characteristics on the preference for electrical energy from SPV systems. Econometric evidence shows heterogeneity in behavioural pattern for these two SPV systems. The flexibility in use and cost of systems might explain this difference. Household characteristics such as monthly household income, household size, occupational status of household head, number of room and type of house significantly influence household's decision for SPV standalone home lighting systems. For SPV mini-grid supply household's income and monthly expenditure on kerosene are significant predictors.

To realize these benefits, however, such systems must reduce energy costs, primary energy consumption, and CO2 emissions relative to conventional heating systems. In this paper, we search for optimized strategies for the integration of a Stirling engine-based micro-cogeneration system in residential buildings by comparing the performance of various system configurations and operational strategies with that of a reference system, i.e. hydronic heating and a low temperature gas boiler in standard and passive house constructions located in different climates. The IDA-ICE whole-building simulation program is employed with the Stirling engine micro-cogeneration model that was developed by IEA/ECBCS Annex 42. In this way the dynamic effects of micro-cogeneration devices, such as warm-ups and shutdowns, are accounted for. This study contributes to the research by addressing hourly changes in the fuel mix used for central electricity generation and the utilization of thermal exhaust through heat recovery. Our results suggest that an optimally operated micro-cogeneration system encompassing heat recovery and appropriate thermal storage would result in a 3-5% decrease in primary energy consumption and CO2 emissions when compared to a conventional hydronic heating system. Moreover, this configuration is capable of delivering annual savings in all the combinations of electricity and fuel price between 0.05 and 0.15 € kW h-1. As can be expected, these results are sensitive to the electrical energy supply mix, building type, and climate. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

To combat unprecedented global warming and to mitigate future energy challenges, there is worldwide interest in utilization of renewable sources of energy such as solar-photovoltaic (solar-PV) and wind energy. Other driving forces paving avenue for renewable energy include rapid escalation in oil prices, growing concerns regarding depletion of oil/gas reserves, etc. Retrofitting of diesel systems with hybrid wind-PV-diesel systems is being widely disseminated to reduce diesel fuel consumption and to minimize atmospheric degradation. One of the potential market for deployment of hybrid systems is in remote locations which are driven by diesel generators. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) has a number of remote villages scattered all over the Kingdom. The aim of this study is to analyze wind speed and solar radiation data of Rafha, KSA, and to assess the technical and economic potential of hybrid wind-PV-diesel power systems to meet the load requirements of a typical remote village Rawdhat Bin Habbas (RBH) with annual electrical energy demand of 15,943 MWh. Rafha is located near RBH. The monthly average wind speeds range from 2.99 m/s to 4.84 m/s at 10 m height. The monthly average daily global solar radiation ranges from 3.04 to 7.3 kWh/sq.m. The hybrid systems simulated consist of different combinations of 600 kW wind machines, PV panels, supplemented by diesel generators. National Renewable Energy Laboratory's (NREL) Hybrid Optimization Model for Electric Renewables (HOMER) software has been used to perform the techno-economic study. The simulation results indicate that for a hybrid system comprising of 1.2 MW wind farm capacity (two 600 kW units, 50 m hub-height) and 1.2 MW of PV capacity together with 4.5 MW diesel system (three 1.5 MW units), the renewable energy fraction with 0% annual capacity shortage is 24% (10% wind + 14% PV). The cost of generating energy (COE) from this hybrid wind-PV-diesel system has been found to be 0.118 $/kWh (assuming diesel fuel price of 0.1$/l). The study exhibits that for a given hybrid configuration, the number of operational hours of diesel generators decreases with increase in wind farm and PV capacity. Attention has also been focused on wind/PV penetration, unmet load, excess electricity generation, percentage of fuel savings and reduction in carbon emissions (relative to diesel-only situation) of different hybrid systems, cost breakdown of wind-PV-diesel systems, COE of different hybrid systems, etc. Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Carbon emissions; Diesel generators; Hybrid systems; PV; Remote loads; Wind turbines","Annual capacity; Atmospheric degradation; Carbon emissions; Climatic anomalies; Cold winter; Daily global solar radiation; Diesel generators; Driving forces; Economic potentials; Electrical energy demand; Electricity generation; Fuel savings; Hub height; Hybrid configurations; Hybrid optimization; Hybrid wind; Kingdom of Saudi Arabia; National Renewable Energy Laboratory; Off-grid electrification; Oil Prices; Potential markets; Power systems; PV; PV panel; PV-diesel systems; Remote loads; Remote location; Remote villages; Renewable energies; Renewable sources; Renewables; Saudi Arabia; Simulation result; Solar radiation data; Techno-economic studies; Techno-economics; Wind energy; Wind farm; Wind farm capacity; Wind machines; Wind speed; Costs; Diesel fuels; Economic analysis; Electric generators; Electric grounding; Electric utilities; Energy management; Fossil fuels; Fuel economy; Global warming; Hybrid computers; Hybrid systems; Photovoltaic cells; Photovoltaic effects; Retrofitting; Solar power generation; Solar radiation; Storms; Sun; Wind power; Wind turbines; Solar energy; carbon emission; diesel; electricity generation; photovoltaic system; renewable resource; rural electrification; solar power; village; wind turbine; Saudi Arabia","Shaahid, S.

This non-renewable energy source, besides causing serious problems to the environment and human health, have high maintenance and operational costs. This paper presents a study on the use of photovoltaic and fuel cells for continuous supply of electric power. The paper outlines the technical and costs characteristics of a pilot project set up in an environmental protection area, located in the state of Tocantins, Brazil. The pilot project uses solar energy as the primary electric power production source. Surplus energy stored in the hydrogen produced by the electrolysis of water is later transformed into electric power by the fuel cells during periods when there is little or no sunlight. A comparative study between the technologies and potential configurations meeting the needs of isolated communities in the Amazon through simulations based on HOMER software are presented.

The situation is described as a demand and supply problem in a multi-agent system with many consumers and suppliers and no explicit communication or coordination among the agents. Such a demand and supply problem is modeled as a Potluck Problem, a generalization of the Santa Fe Bar Problem. Power produced by PV panels and batteries may be used in the local market, in addition to being consumed locally. The proposed microgrid system model is able to determine the optimum operation of a solar-powered microgrid with respect to load demand, environmental requirements, PV panel and battery capacities. The results indicate the effect of various such parameters on the performance of these micro-grids. This paper also analyzes and proposes, based on auction theory, the most efficient and competing pricing mechanism in the proposed microgrid system model. Two important market bidding techniques, single bidding and discriminatory bidding, are considered. The microgrid is made to participate in the bidding process to serve the consumers at a reduced price and to provide better revenues.

The average lifetime of PV modules can be expected to be more than 25 years. The disposal of PV systems will become a problem in view of the continually increasing production of PV modules. These can be recycled for about the same cost as their disposal. Photovoltaic modules in crystalline silicon solar cells are made from the following elements, in order of mass: glass, aluminium frame, EVA copolymer transparent hermetising layer, photovoltaic cells, installation box, Tedlar® protective foil and assembly bolts. From an economic point of view, taking into account the price and supply level, pure silicon, which can be recycled from PV cells, is the most valuable construction material used. Recovering pure silicon from damaged or end-of-life PV modules can lead to economic and environmental benefits. Because of the high quality requirement for the recovered silicon, chemical processing is the most important stage of the recycling process. The chemical treatment conditions need to be precisely adjusted in order to achieve the required purity level of the recovered silicon. For PV systems based on crystalline silicon, a series of etching processes was carried out as follows: etching of electric connectors, anti-reflective coating and n-p junction. The chemistry of etching solutions was individually adjusted for the different silicon cell types. Efforts were made to formulate a universal composition for the etching solution. The principal task at this point was to optimise the etching temperature, time and alkali concentration in such a way that only as much silicon was removed as necessary. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

This work was performed through a dairy farm milk collection post energy audit, to perform energy profile characterization and demand requirements. Following that, a study of the weather conditions was done and the obtained data (through CLIMAAT and MacSIMAR projects) [11] was introduced in a renewable energy solutions calculator (HOMER). Moreover, a system design from the available portfolio of micro-generation devices was defined and a cost benefit analysis of the selected alternatives was done. In the end a comparison of the current implemented solution with alternative designs was performed. Results show that from the analyzed solutions for this case, the set of PV (20Kw) and Wind (3KW) with no batteries is the best one, since it presents the least cost of energy, the smallest initial capital and the highest Net Present Cost. The sensitivity analysis derive that wind micro-turbines should be installed except if the solar radiation is on its maximum value and that in no case the use of batteries is an advantage for the system operation. For systems requiring a certain degree of energy (in this case with an average of 350 kW/day), the implementation of micro generation systems, like the ones evaluated, will never be economically viable in terms of Total Economic Value, even with generous feed-in tariff schemes. It is preferable that the grid operator makes investments in renewable energy production.

In this work we explore the potential of building-scale alternative energy technologies to reduce demand and emissions while also shielding building owners from the risks associated with fluctuations in the price of natural gas and grid electricity. We analyze the monetary costs and benefits over the life cycle of five technologies (photovoltaic and wind electricity generation, solar air and water heating, and ground source heat pumps) over three audience or building types (homeowners, small businesses, large commercial and institutional entities). The analysis includes a Monte Carlo analysis to measure risk that can be compared to other investment opportunities. The results indicate that under government incentives and climate of Toronto, Canada, the returns are relatively high for small degrees of risks for a number of technologies.

The main objective of the present study is to determine the optimum size of systems able to fulfill the requirements of 50 kWh/day primary load with 11 kW peak load for 50 households for three remote sites located at Cox's Bazar, Sylhet and Dinajpur. The methodology applied provides a useful and simple approach for sizing and analyzing the hybrid systems using HOMER, an optimization model for renewable energies. The aim is to identify a configuration among a set of systems that meets the desired system reliability requirements with the lowest electricity unit cost. The result of the analysis is a list of feasible power supply systems, sorted according to their net present cost. Furthermore, sensitivity diagrams, showing the influence of solar radiation, wind speed and diesel prices on the optimum solutions are also presented.

Algeria is considered as one of the world regions that receive a great portion of solar radiation per year. In some remote areas, where this is the case, a judicious combination of other renewable Sources to form a Photovoltaic or hybrid system can help solve rural electrification problems, where the grid extension is costly and the cost of fuel increases drastically with the remoteness of the location. On the other hand the surface of south Algerian is over 2.000.000 km2, where just the town of Adrar is 400.000 km2, which make operation of extension the electric grid in remote area very hard and very expensive, like small villages called (ksours) situated in center of desert. Small off-grid standalone renewable energy systems represent an important option for narrowing the electricity gap in rural parts of the developing these remote ksours in Adrar. The aim of this study is to analyze long-term solar radiation data of Adrar (south of Algeria) to assess the techno-economic feasibility of utilizing PV-battery power systems to meet the load of a typical house building with annual electrical energy demand of 4000 kWh. The power load of house is calculated on the basis of Algerian finance law of year 2008, for an average family. The government through this law, pays 50% of electricity consumes with a maximum threshold of 4000 kWh per annum.

On the other hand, high population concentration, rapid industrialisation and economic development of urban areas all over the world have caused significant degradation of the urban air quality. In this context, the actual performance of five identical pairs of roof-top PV-panels, operating in the aggravated urban environment of Athens (from the atmospheric air pollution point of view), is currently evaluated.

Therefore, this uniqueness must be taken into account when we consider economic policies such as subsidies to promote such technologies. Previously we constructed a growth model of renewable energies, in which the learning effect dominating the cost of the early stage of industries and the demand of consumers for environmental value were considered. In this study we connected the above growth model with the comprehensive socio-economic optimizing model, and examined the effect of economic policies such as a greenhouse gases emission tax and a subsidy the whole Japanese economy, and the total amount of greenhouse gas emissions with the residential photovoltaic industry as a case study. In the growth model, the demand change when renewable energy industries are subsidized with a restricted budget and the parameter changes with social cognition by the diffusion of renewable energy itself are also considered. The socio-economic optimizing model consists of the input-output relationship for monetary balance, some macroeconomic balances and GDP as the objective function. We examined first the effect of a promotion policy consisting of a tax on greenhouse gas emissions and a subsidy for the residential photovoltaic industry financed by the tax income. The simulated period was from 2005 to 2015 and the policy was introduced in 2007. The photovoltaic cell increased proportionally to the tax rate and significant growth was observed in 2007, the first year of the promotion policy. However, predicted photovoltaic power supply in 2015 was no more than 0.8% of the total demand and this suggests the promotion policy for a single industry is insufficient to contribute to a decrease in global warming. As for the total national economic and environmental effect, both GDP and total greenhouse gas emissions decreased with introduction of the emission tax. Next, we examined the case when total emissions were restricted. Diffusion of the residential photovoltaic industry was also remarkable early in the simulated period. GDP increased when the emission tax and subsidy was introduced into the simulation, indicating the promotion policy for renewable energy industries may be effective even for the economy, under strict restriction on greenhouse gas emissions. The results of the simulation showed that the promotion policy is effective for increasing production of the residential photovoltaic industry, for reduction in total greenhouse gases emissions and for an increase in GDP when the total emissions of greenhouse gases are restricted. Further studies are planned on a comprehensive promotion policy for renewable energy contributions to mitigate global warming and energy resource depletion by expanding this simulation model to other renewable energies and reconsidering the whole energy system. © 2010, JAPAN SECTION OF THE REGIONAL SCIENCE ASSOCIATION INTERNATIONAL.

Yet PV in Germany is only 30% as economically efficient as wind power, while up to 19 times as much energy would be saved if the same funds were used to thermally renovate homes. The generous subsidy has led to increasing demand for PV units and an annual increase in subsidies of around 50%. This study investigates why these subsidies were instigated and why they continue. Because both material and social factors appear to play a role, a composite analytical framework is developed, using actor-network theory (ANT) and policy discourse approaches. This is achieved through discarding ontologically unsound concepts of radical human/non-human symmetry in ANT, while re-materialising the concept of discourse, and theorising how to test the veracity of strands in discourse which make truth claims about the material world. The result shows that the German PV subsidy system can be explained in terms of various interplays of material and discursive factors which have held sway in it at crucial times, from its inception to the present day.","Actor-network theory; Discourse; Germany; Photovoltaic","cost-benefit analysis; electrical power; electricity generation; photovoltaic system; Central Europe; Eurasia; Europe; Germany","Galvin, R.; University of East AngliaUnited Kingdom; email: r.galvin@uea.ac.uk",,,09678875,,,,"English","Work.

Renewable energy systems were simulated using HOMER, the load profile of a hostel in Cameroon, the solar insolation of Garoua and the flow of river Mungo. For a 40% increase in the cost of imported power system components, the cost of energy was found to be either 0.352 €/kWh for a 5 kW pico-hydro generator with 72 kWh storage or 0.396 €/kWh for a 3 kWp photovoltaic generator with 36 kWh storage. These energy costs were obtained with a biomass resource cost of 25 €/tonne. The pH and PV hybrid systems both required the parallel operation of a 3.3 kW battery inverter with a 10 kW biogas generator. The pH/biogas/battery systems simulated for villages located in the south of Cameroon with a flow rate of at least 92 l/s produced lower energy costs than PV/biogas/battery systems simulated for villages in the north of Cameroon with an insolation level of at least 5.55 kWh/m2/day. For a single-wire grid extension cost of 5000 €/km, operation and maintenance costs of 125 €/yr/km and a grid power price of 0.1 €/kWh, the breakeven grid extension distances were found to be 12.9 km for pH/biogas/battery systems and 15.2 km for PV/biogas/battery systems respectively.

Although it was introduced many years ago, till today it still encounters many barriers for penetration into public realm especially in urban residential sector. Identification and assessment of these non-technical barriers that hinder the rapid diffusion of this technology into the Malaysian urban residential sector is important. According to Farhar, B.C.(1996), understanding the public awareness and perception of this emerging renewable technology is important because perceptions of what people believe to be real is real in its consequences and perceptions and preferences are themselves facts that describe the social world in which people operate. In addition, Farhar, B.C.(1996), also pointed out that people perceptions and preferences about energy and the environment are influenced by objectively factual information. Therefore, by assessing the public perceptions on acceptance of Photovoltaic technology, more effective strategies can be drawn for implementing programmes for adoption of this technology. In order to assess these non-technical barriers, Trudgill's frameworks for analysis has been deployed for this purpose. Trudgill's framework for analysis was developed by Stephen Trudgill which consist of six major groups of barriers namely, agreement, knowledge, technological, economic, social and political. This framework was used to identify of the non-technical barriers and subsequently forms a basis for analysis and discussion. In this research, a purposive sample of 400 Kuala Lumpur households was developed, and face-to-face interviews were conducted. Each of these interviews was undertaken with structured questionaires. The analysis of the field survey data forms a basis for assessment of non-technical barriers for the rapid diffusion of BIPV in Kuala Lumpur residential sector.","Emerging technology; Frameworks for analysis; Non-technical barriers; Photovoltaic (PV); Public perceptions; Rapid diffusion",,"Haw, L.

Assessment criteria comprised net present cost (NPC), renewable fraction (RF) and payback time. The RES software HOMER (National Renewable Energy Laboratory, US) was utilised as the assessment tool with modeling performed with hourly load data input from a hotel located in a subtropical coastal area of Queensland, Australia. The results demonstrate that RES, in principle, has the potential to supply significant power for a large-scale tourist accommodation, in conjunction with the grid-electricity supply. Optimisation modeling demonstrated that, at 2004 prices, the NPC of the grid/RES hybrid configuration is comparable with the grid-only supply and resulted in a RF of 73%, a payback time of 14 years and a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of 65%. Optimisation modeling also showed that whilst a RES-only configuration can potentially supply 100% of power demand, such a configuration is presently uneconomical given current electricity costs. Results indicate that wind energy conversion systems (WECS), rather than photovoltaics, are the most economically viable RES technology for large-scale grid-connected operations. Specifically, large-scale WECS (over 1000 kW) are more efficient and more economical than multiple small-scale WECS (0.1-100 kW). Hydrogen fuel cells and storage are presently uneconomical in grid-connected configurations. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated that operations that rely on grid-only supply are more economically susceptible to escalations in electricity costs and the imposition of carbon taxes, in comparison to grid/RES hybrids. Indeed, at present electricity prices, which have nearly quadrupled since 2004, the grid/RES hybrid is more economical over a 20-year span than the grid-only system, with a NPC which is 50% lower, and a payback time of 4.5 years. The analysis demonstrates that RES is both technically feasible and economically viable as an addition to grid-connected supply for large-scale tourist operations, and should become more attractive as costs of conventional supplies increase. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The analysis utilised the power load data from three accommodation case studies that had RES/hybrids already installed. The accommodation sites, chosen from diverse locations within Australia, varied in both climatic and geographic characteristics. The assessment criteria for the analysis were net present cost (NPC), renewable factor (RF) and payback time. The specific operational characteristics of the tourism accommodation sector, such as 24-h operation, comfort provision and low tolerance for failure, necessitates a separate assessment of RES viability for this sector, rather than relying on similar assessments from other commercial and domestic sectors, which may not be representative. This study utilised RES assessment software, HOMER (National Renewable Energy Laboratory, US) in order to compare the present RES/hybrid configuration to diesel generator-only (genset-only), RES-only and optimised RES/hybrid configurations. Analysis of both actual data and modeling results demonstrated that RES can adequately and reliably meet the power demand for stand-alone small to medium-scale tourist accommodations. Optimisation, achieved by further addition of RES to the existing configurations, reduced NPC in the majority of cases, with the added benefit of increased RF. Furthermore, NPC for these optimised RES/hybrid configurations were comparable to the optimised genset-only configurations. Modeling of conversions to RES-only configurations demonstrated this option as uneconomical unless existing RF was already high. Results indicated that wind energy conversion systems (WECS), rather than photovoltaics, were the most economical RES for sampled hybrid systems. For example, the payback time of the WECS/hybrids was approximately 3-4 years compared to PV/hybrids at 6-7 years. Hydrogen fuel cells and storage systems, whilst technically feasible, were not economically viable for the case studies due to the present high cost of components, especially compared to gensets. Modeling future potential increase in diesel fuel prices and implementation of carbon taxes shows a significant increase in NPC for genset-only configurations compared to RES/hybrid configurations in the sample. Carbon taxes of $50/ton increases NPC by 10% for genset-only systems but increases NPC less than half that amount for RES/hybrid systems. The data and subsequent modeling demonstrate that RES is both technically feasible and economically viable compared to diesel energy supply, for the small to medium-scale tourist operations sampled, dependent on stand-alone power supplies. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

More specifically, solar radiation and electricity market data for the period 1 January 2005-31 December 2006 are examined for locations near Mississauga, Ontario and Kingston, Ontario. The hybrid optimization model for electric renewables (HOMER) program is used for the simulation of solar electricity output. For Mississauga, the average monthly value of the solar electricity based on Ontario's uniform pricing system (the hourly Ontario energy price, or HOEP) was C$20.62. Based on nodal pricing, the average monthly value was C$27.20 per month (32% higher). For Kingston, the average monthly value of the solar electricity based on HOEP was C$23.78 per month. Based on nodal pricing, the average monthly value was C$36.03 (52% higher). Over the two-year period, the monthly differences were greatest during the summer, with a 53% spread in June in Mississauga and a 106% spread in May in Kingston. As debates regarding electricity futures progress, the importance of proper valuation of alternative generation sources continues to be critical.

About 67 million of them use kerosene for lighting. Government of India is promoting the use of solar home systems (SHS) as one of the options for meeting lighting requirements in households in remote and less inhabited villages. About 363,399 SHS were reportedly disseminated across the country by December 2007. Apart from meeting the basic lighting need of the households, SHS also help in abating the emissions of green house gases (GHGs) by directly displacing the use of kerosene in households that currently use it for lighting. This study has attempted at estimating the CO2 mitigation potential of SHS in India by studying the potential for their diffusion and the appropriate baseline. Subsequently, the scope for cost reduction to the user due to carbon finance, if received, is also studied. It is found that carbon finance could reduce the effective burden of SHS to the user by 19% if carbon prices were $10/tCO2221 US$=40 Rs. as on December 2007. and no transaction costs were involved in getting the carbon revenues. These benefits are also estimated for scenarios where transaction costs are incurred by the project proponent in getting the carbon benefits. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Therefore, special financing mechanisms need to be implemented to support their dissemination. For instance, fee-for-service schemes enable users to spread the up-front costs of photovoltaic systems over a long period, and provide a solution to the problem of their long-term maintenance. The paper surveys Energy Service Companies (ESCOs) that have been established in the Eastern Province of Zambia. Three small enterprises have been selected in 1999 and each manage 100-150 solar home systems. Regular contacts with technicians facilitate their follow-up and provide feedback from customers. Systems are now running efficiently and customers seem satisfied with the quality of the service provided. However, solar systems tend to be overused and batteries to be constantly discharged as the electricity loads increases. Furthermore, these small enterprises still face financial uncertainties due to a high inflation rate in Zambia and the difficulty to increase regularly monthly fees. Even with an initial subsidy from the funding agency, only the wealthiest customers of the area, with regular incomes, can be targeted. And like all rural electrification programs, a long-term involvement of the state is still needed to cover part of the capital costs and expand the scheme to new customers. However, even with its current limitations, this case shows that a well-articulated public-private partnership can deliver a cost-effective energy service in rural areas. With a more flexible offer of photovoltaic systems and the addition of other energy services, small energy companies seem to be able to usefully complement the role of conventional utilities. © 2009 International Energy Initiative.","Energy service companies; Photovoltaic fee-for-service model; Rural electrification concession; Solar home systems; Zambia","Cost effectiveness; Costs; Developing countries; Electric utilities; Finance; Photovoltaic cells; Sales; Solar buildings; Solar power generation; Energy service company; Rural electrification; Service Model; Solar home system; Zambia; Rural areas; cost; developing world; financial provision; photovoltaic system; rural electrification; service provision; solar power; Africa; Southern Africa; Sub-Saharan Africa; Zambia","Lemaire, X.; Centre for Management under Regulation, Warwick Business School, University of Warwick, CV4 7AL Coventry, United Kingdom; email: Xavier.Lemaire@wbs.ac.uk",,"Elsevier",09730826,,,,"English","Energy Sustainable Dev.",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-65549094523

Especially within the quantitative analyses, the results indicate that economic consideration of the respective renewable energy system, understood as a positive cost-benefit calculation made by the individual, is the strongest predictor for a reported acceptance. Furthermore, the importance of landscape evaluation and a strong connection between procedural justice criteria, such as transparency, early and accurate information as well as possibilities to participate during the planning and installation process, and a reported public acceptance became evident. Qualitative data were analysed in reference to the grounded theory and showed the relevance of the operating company's commitment on the local level, participation of the general public and the choice of the location for the plant were among the relevant aspects for acceptance in the implementation process.

Various technical, economic, behavioural and institutional changes are needed to establish a UK market for micro-generation.

The other is that we evaluate the competitiveness of a certain energy system from the viewpoint of a whole urban area because there are multiple alternatives for attaining the same target of reducing CO2 emission of energy consumption. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Break-even cost; CO2 emissions; Distributed generators; Energy saving; Local energy system","Electric generators; Electric power utilization; Energy conservation; Multiobjective optimization; Photovoltaic cells; Distributed generators; Local energy system; Electric power distribution","Sugihara, H.; Osaka UniversityJapan",,,04247760,,EENJA,,"English","Electr Eng Jpn",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-43949126883

The analysis utilises the power load data from a hotel located in a subtropical coastal area of Queensland, Australia. The assessment criteria of the analysis are net present cost, renewable factor and payback time. Due to the limited number of RES case studies in tourist operations and the absence of studies for large resorts, requiring facilities with a higher degree of comfort such as air-conditioning, it is not possible to establish with confidence the viability of RES in this industry. The specific operational characteristics of the tourism accommodation sector, such as 24-h operation, comfort provision and low tolerance for failure necessitates a separate assessment of RES viability for this sector, rather than relying on similar assessments from other commercial sectors. This study uses RES assessment software tools, HOMER (National Renewable Energy Laboratory, US) and HYBRIDS (Solaris Homes, Queensland, Australia), in order to compare diesel generator-only, RES-only and RES/diesel hybrid technologies. HOMER uses hourly load data, whilst HYBRIDS uses average daily energy demand for each month. The modelling results demonstrate that RES, in principle, has the potential to adequately and reliably meet power demand for a stand-alone large-scale tourist accommodation. Optimisation modelling demonstrates that 100% of power demand can be supplied by a RES-only configuration. A hybrid diesel/RES configuration provides the lowest NPC result with a resultant RF of 76%. In comparison to the diesel generator-only configuration, NPC is reduced by 50% and Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions by 65%. The payback time of the hybrid RES scenario is 4.3 years. Results indicate that wind energy conversion systems (WECS), rather than photovoltaics, are the most economically viable RES for large-scale operations. Large-scale WECS (over 1000 kW) are more efficient and economical than multiple small-scale WECS (0.1-100 kW). Both modelling tools produced similar results, with HYBRIDS producing on average slightly higher NPC results than HOMER. The modelling and resulting data from the analysis indicate that RES is technically feasible and economically viable as a replacement for conventional thermal energy supply for large-scale tourist operations dependent on stand-alone power supplies. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The paper is based on a study produced by Programme pour la Promotion de l'Electrification Rurale et l'Approvisionnement en Combustibles Domestiques, an advising body for the Senegalese Ministry of Energy and Mines. Design/methodology/approach - The profitability index Taux d'Enrichissement en Capital is used as the main criterion for the economic evaluation of four technologies: diesel mini-grids, photovoltaic, hybrid (pv-diesel) generators, and solar home systems. Household demand is derived from real data of socio-economic studies which serve as the basis for determining market segments defined by the distribution of the willingness to pay and the levels of service. Findings - The simulations from nine demand cases show that high investment and/or operation expenditure create an insurmountable barrier given the limited payment capacity of rural populations, demonstrating that projects in this context are not profitable without subsidies. However, decentralised PV generation technologies are already demonstrated to be the least cost solution when the village lies further than 5.4 kilometers from the transmission grid. Originality/value - This paper describes a planning path that could enable a faster implementation of rural electrification programs in remote areas considering three main elements, namely; willingness to pay, reduction of levels of supply service and support of communal management. However, the focus of the present work is mainly devoted to an analysis of the first two elements. Finally, the paper addresses the issue of how these technologies can be better implemented by national agencies and investors, with potential application outside of the Senegalese case study.","Economic planning; Energy supply systems; Rural regions; Senegal","Cost reduction; Electric power generation; Electric power systems; Industrial economics; Profitability; Rural areas; Decentralised generation; Economic planning; Electricity supply systems; Electrification; Energy supply systems; Energy management","Contreras, Z.; School of Economics, University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia; email: z.contreras@student.unsw.edu.au",,,17506220,,,,"English","Int.

The authors also made an investigation into the required economic conditions necessary for making H2-RE residential systems competitive with conventional ones, which are based on the use of grid electricity and natural gas. A case study was enacted in a small residential district in Palermo (Italy) made by five multi-storey buildings. Many energy systems have been considered according to several fuel-device combinations (electric grid, fuel cell, PV panels, wind turbines, boiler etc.). The software HOMER (hybrid optimization model for electric renewables), developed by NREL and Midwest Research Institute (USA), was used, in order to study the energy balance of the system and its components. Moreover, it was possible to simulate the hourly operation of each system and to calculate technical, economic and environmental performance parameters. The net present cost and the cost of energy are the two main parameters used to compare economic performances of the systems with both actual and expected costs in the medium term. A sensitivity analysis was carried out in order to appreciate the most important parameters influencing the economic performances of the systems and to define possible future scenarios of competitiveness between technologies.

The main objective of the present study is to find the optimum size of system, able to fulfill the energy requirements of a given load distribution, for three sites located at Corsica island and to analyze the impact of different parameters on the system size. The methodology used provides a useful and simple approach for sizing and analyzing an HPWS. In the proposed stand-alone system, a new concept such as the supply of wind power via a uninterruptible power supply (UPS) is introduced and therefore the energy produced by the wind generator can be sent directly to the load. In this context, an optimization sizing model is developed. It consists of three submodels; system components submodels, technical submodel based on the loss of power supply probability (LPSP) and the economical submodel based on the levelized cost of energy (LCE). Applying the developed model, a set of configurations meeting the desired LPSP are obtained. The configuration with the lowest LCE gives the optimal one. Analyzing the optimal system configurations used to satisfy the requirements of typical residential home (3 kWh/day), a significant reduction in system size is observed as the available renewable potential increases leading to a considerable decrease in LCE (case of Cape corse site). The 2 days storage capacity is found to be the best for the optimal configuration with the lowest LCE. On the other hand, for low energy requirements, the LCE is found relatively high and decreases sharply with the increase in load. However, for low LPSP values, the LCE is found to rise sharply for a little increase in LPSP. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

For the same energy output, the combined collectors lead to a lower total area than separate thermal and PV collectors. Numerical models were developed for two types of hybrid collectors, with a flat-plate and tube geometry: one using monocrystalline silicon (mono-Si) PV cells and one using amorphous silicon (a-Si) flexible PV cells. The electrical, thermal and total efficiency characteristics of both types were quantified. Application of the hybrid collectors to a system generating electricity and hot water was analysed, considering two building types: a residential building and a hotel. The electrical and thermal energies produced annually, as well as the amount of backup energy, were calculated by means of the SolTerm energy simulation program for the climatic conditions of Porto, Lisbon, Faro and Bragança (Portugal). An economical analysis was carried out by comparing the hybrid system with a conventional energy system and with a system with thermal collectors and PV modules installed separately. Finally, the environmental impact of the hybrid system was assessed and compared with a conventional energy system. © 2008 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,"Oliveira, A.C.; Faculty of Engineering, University of Porto (New Energy Technology Unit), Rua Dr. Roberto Frias, Porto, 4200-465, Portugal; email: acoliv@fe.up.pt",,,01430750,,,,"English","Int J Ambient Energy",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-56649120359

Whilst it has been estimated that micro-generation could meet 30-40% of UK electricity demand by 2050, deployment to date has been slow. In its Micro-generation Strategy the UK government has started to outline how deployment could be increased. Various technical, economic, behavioural and institutional changes are needed to establish a UK market for micro-generation. This article discusses how different deployment models for domestic micro-generation might attract investments in these technologies. It considers not only investments by individual households but also by energy companies. Starting from an economic analysis of payback times for three different technologies (micro-CHP, micro-wind and solar PV) it identifies policy and regulatory recommendations. It argues for technology-specific support policies in the short term. It also suggests that a 'level playing field' for micro-generation technologies as a result of fiscal and market reforms could considerably increase the attractiveness of micro-generation technologies. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

With a largely rural population living in sparsely populated, remote locations, solar home systems (SHS) will play an important role in meeting the off-grid component of rural electrification in East Timor. This paper describes current experience and trials in East Timor with solar photovoltaic (PV) technology. It examines the East Timorese context against six 'key features' identified by the World Bank as typically included in solar PV projects: delivery infrastructure; access to finance; rural electrification policy; guarantees for minimum quality; understanding of customer needs; and scaling up capacity building. Of these issues, the authors contend that selection of the delivery infrastructure model is the most critical decision, and that for East Timor, in its present stage of development, a market-driven approach for SHS is unlikely to be successful. A model which subsidises capital costs but seeks full recovery of operating costs is recommended. Irrespective of the delivery infrastructure model, for sustainability, capacity must be developed in a range of other areas, particularly the commercial availability of high-quality components and spare parts; creation of a pool of skilled technicians for installation and maintenance; and development of a robust fee collection and maintenance infrastructure.

On the other hand, the initial cost will decrease with the technological progress and the expansion of production. Few of researches addressed the economic effect of these systems considering the initial cost redemption. By using the learning curve methodology, the initial cost redemption of these systems from 2005 to 2030 is predicted at an interval of 5 years.

Distributed generation utilizing renewable energy resources offers opportunities for significant carbon dioxide and emissions reductions thus contributing solutions to broader climate change issues. Yet, renewable energy technologies like PV face various barriers for their widespread adoption. Aside from technical and cost issues, renewable technologies have to overcome the so-called carbon lock-in effects. This refers to the techno-institutional complex associated with the fossil-fuel based centralized generation regime that currently dominates energy production and use. Governmental interventions to address these issues usually can be seen as composed of research, development, demonstration and deployment or RD3 [PCAST, 1999. Panel on International Cooperation in Energy Research, Development, Demonstration, and Deployment]. This paper focused on comparing the deployment aspect of PV technology in Japan and the USA. While both governments promoted PV as part of their larger strategies to address various environmental and energy security issues, Japan has built a PV installation capacity three times that of the USA as of December 2003 with over 90% of PV installation in the grid-connected small residential system category. This is in marked contrast to the case in the USA in which the cumulative installation is spilt among different types of applications involving the grid and off the grid. We put forward two models to explain these differences in deployment strategies and their possible consequences. The first deployment model leverages upon PV as a manufactured technology with minimal customization to achieve massive deployment. The second deployment model leverages upon PV as an information technology-like technology focusing upon user oriented customization to achieve deployment. Different models have different implications to the system engineering aspect of solar PV. A focus upon the standard grid-connected distributed category in the residential setting avoids the heavy customized engineering associated with many off-grid and one-off type projects. Japanese PV deployment strategy of concentrating upon a dominant category or niche with mass market potential also well matches the institutional structure of production [Coase, 1991. The Institutional Structure of Production, in Essays on Economics and Economists. The University of Chicago Press, Chicago] within the local PV technology suppliers industry. Major vertical integrated firms can facilitate system-related learning easier than a fragmented industry within the PV value chain with minimal transaction cost. This highly suggests that deployment strategy of PV or other renewable energy technologies must address the issues of adopting a globally developed technology to local (national) conditions and has strong institutional underpinnings in addition to financial subsidies, learning investment thinking. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the influence is relatively small. The optimal capacity has an increase of 0.4 kW with the adoption of carbon tax of 10 Yen/kg-C.3) Electricity buy-back price has a positive influence on PV adoption. With a price of 25 Yen/kWh, the customer prefers to adopt the maximal PV capacity limited to the available site area.

It complements an earlier supply-side analysis by the authors that demonstrates the potential to reduce PV module prices below $1.5/Wp by scaling up existing thin-film technology in 100 MWp/yr manufacturing facilities. The present article demonstrates that, at that price, PV modules may be cost effective in 125,000 new home installations per year (0.5 GWp/yr). While this market is large enough to support multiple scaled up thin-film PV factories, inefficient energy pricing and demand-side market failures will inhibit prospective PV consumers without strong public policy support. Net metering rules, already implemented in many states to encourage PV market launch, represent a crude but reasonable surrogate for efficient electricity pricing mechanisms that may ultimately emerge to internalize the externality benefits of PV. These public benefits include reduced air pollution damages (estimated costs of damage to human health from fossil fuel power plants are presented in Appendix A), deferral of transmission and distribution capital expenditures, reduced exposure to fossil fuel price risks, and increased electricity system reliability for end users. Thus, net metering for PV ought to be implemented as broadly as possible and sustained until efficient pricing is in place.

Currently, policymakers are seeking ways to expand markets for off-grid PV from solar home systems to productive uses in order to enhance income generation and contribute to social development. This paper explores the role of the state in promoting such market growth. As a start, the state must improve institutions, thus echoing popular recommendations based in new institutional economic theory (NIE) that are currently touted by the World Bank and other large development agencies. Yet, NIE's framework may be insufficient because it fails to offer viable solutions to overcoming political barriers that contribute to technological path dependency. A case study in Punjab, India, where an agricultural PV water pumping program showed promising signs of successful market penetration in its first 3 years of operation, illustrates how the NIE's shortcomings manifest themselves in practice. The program was beginning to penetrate market entry for PV pumps via competition between PV providers. However, the government of India achieved this feat by providing subsidies to wealthy farmers, a move that is frowned upon by the NIE school. Based on findings from the case study, states should look beyond NIE's framework to expand and improve PV markets in productive uses by accounting for political constraints, assessing how PV technology can improve development goals, and cultivating locally appropriate service delivery models. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

MATLAB Simulink is used to match the load with the demand and apportion the electrical production between the PV and diesel-electric generator. The economic part of the model calculates the fuel consumed, the kilowatthours obtained per gallon of fuel supplied, and the total cost of fuel. The environmental part of the model calculates the CO2, particulate matter (PM), and the NOx emitted to the atmosphere. Simulations based on an actual system in the remote Alaskan community of Lime Village were performed for three cases: 1) diesel only; 2) diesel-battery; and 3) PV with diesel-battery using a one-year time period. The simulation results were utilized to calculate the energy payback, the simple payback time for the PV module, and the avoided costs of CO2, NOx, and PM. Post-simulation analysis includes the comparison of results with those predicted by Hybrid Optimization Model for Electric Renewables (HOMER). The life-cycle cost (LCC) and air emissions results of our Simulink model were comparable to those predicted by HOMER. © 2005 IEEE.","Energy payback period; Greenhouse emissions; Hybrid power system; Photovoltaic (PV) array; Power system monitoring; Remote terminal unit","Computer simulation; Diesel fuels; Economics; Electric generators; Environmental impact; Lead acid batteries; Mathematical models; Photovoltaic cells; Energy payback period; Greenhouse emissions; Hybrid power system; Power system monitoring; Remote terminal unit; Electric power systems","Wies, R.W.; Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of Alaska, Fairbanks, AK 99775-5915, United States; email: ffrww@uaf.edu",,,08858950,,ITPSE,,"English","IEEE Trans Power Syst",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-18944373867

This paper presents the outcome and the analysis of a study conducted with the objective of investigating the social, economic and environmental impact of SHSs in rural Sri Lanka. The study involved conducting a survey of 125 households having SHSs, in the Uva province of Sri Lanka, through personal visits. It was evident that the households are extremely satisfied with the technology that has replaced their kerosene lamps, which had been providing household lighting requirements. The quality of life, in terms of activities such as longer study hours of children, longer TV watching hours for the family and lessening the risk of fatal kerosene lamp accidents, has improved with the introduction of the SHSs. It is concluded that the large-scale penetration of solar home systems in Sri Lanka has helped rural communities both in terms of improved socio-economic conditions and reduced adverse environmental impacts, contrary to the belief that the financial burden of such systems imposed on the families outweighs the benefits. But when comparing the benefits of SHSs against the extension of the national grid, the country needs to seriously examine its options for the areas currently targeted by SHS dealers. © 2005 International Energy Initiative, Inc.",,"Economic analysis; Economic and social effects; Environmental impact; Kerosene; Lighting; Marketing; Photovoltaic cells; Rural areas; Solar power generation; Adverse environmental impacts; Financial incentives; Household lighting; Marketing strategy; Socio-economic conditions; Socio-economic impacts; Solar home system; Solar photovoltaic system; Solar buildings","Wijayatunga, P.D.C.; Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka, BOC Merchant Tower, Colombo 3, Sri Lanka; email: priyantha@pucsl.gov.lk",,"Elsevier",09730826,,,,"English","Energy Sustainable Dev.",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-65549166452

This offers the advantages of a ""converter-per-panel"" approach without the cost or efficiency penalties of individual dc-ac grid connected inverters.

Matlab simulations are used to compare the efficiency of each topology as well as evaluating the benefits of increasing cost and complexity. The buck and then boost converters are shown to be the most efficient topologies for a given cost, with the buck best suited for long strings and the boost for short strings.

As global environmental issues become a greater concern, more generation may need to come from renewable sources. One often-mentioned alternative is residential solar photovoltaic (PV) systems, which could be an especially attractive source of energy in the southwestern United States, where high amounts of solar radiation are available. In this paper, we compare the life-cycle costs of current solar photovoltaic technology in Arizona versus New York to highlight the relevant issues related to the economic and environmental renewable energy decision-making process. We find that solar PV systems alone are currently inferior to grid electricity across a wide range of scenarios, including prospective technology improvements. Net metering with PV systems, where customers sell solar electricity to the grid and buy back their demand, may be competitive given real-time electricity pricing. Using PV systems in remote systems looks to be a viable alternative. © ASCE.",,"Environmental engineering; Fossil fuel deposits; Hydroelectric power; Photovoltaic effects; Renewable energy resources; Life cycle costs; Photovoltaic systems; Solar radiation; alternative energy; cost-benefit analysis; electricity generation; photovoltaic system; renewable resource","Matthews, H.S.; Civil and Environmental Engineering, Engineering and Public Policy, Carnegie Mellon Univ., Pittsburgh, PA 15213, United States",,"ASCE - American Society of Civil Engineers",10760342,,,,"English","J.

The cost of infrastructure to mainly scattered communities has been perennially cited by engineers as largely to blame. This is undeniably a problem, but only pan of it. There are in addition, myriads of social, economic and political obstacles that play an unquantified and frequently un-recognised negative role. At the route of the problem lies a subdued role of the would-be recipients who in fact, unlike anybody else, are conversant with their problems. Consequently a number of products may come as impositions or misplaced priorities. The advantages of consumer participation for sustainable development are well documented and often rehearsed like a song at international forums and in publications. In practice, however, the concept is largely ignored or frowned upon for a variety of reasons and even when tried the consumers' priorities are presumed and their roles prescribed. In one South African model, rural villages are zoned out to so called Concession holders (largely multinational corporations) to carry out services as basic as dissemination of solar (PV) home systems and retailing of ordinary cooking gas, with government subsidies. This presents a clearly missed opportunity for rural enterprise as it makes any competing venture both unviable and perhaps illegal. On the other hand, examples are abound when a clearly advantageous technology is rejected outright by a community apparently for some inexplicable reasons. As if these were not bad enough, then enters the African politician with a characteristically hidden agenda and a master of the power of rural electricity as a means of getting another term in office. This paper aims to put on the table a thought provoking display of a range of obstacles to rural development. It is hoped that the exposure might kindle a debate devoid of denials but a sincere re-examination of our current practices.","African rural environment; Electrification; Policy; Rural communities; Social equity","Electric power systems; Energy policy; Industrial economics; Solar equipment; Electrification; Energy utilization","Sebitosi, A.B.; Power Electronics Group, Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Cape Town, Private Bag, Rondebosch 7701, South Africa; email: abitosi@powerelec.ee.uct.ac.za",,,1021447X,,JESAE,,"English","J Energy South Afr",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0242366642

However, each individual PV system usually supplies energy only to one consumer. In such a case we have several consumers that each one of them uses a stand-alone PV system. This situation would expose such stand-alone systems to transient excessive loads larger than the power generated by the PVs, and then the battery is bound to discharge even during the day. For overcoming this problem, we suggest an autonomous centralized PV system, comprising one battery bank and plural subsystems connected to each other. From solar radiation data and load profiles, the performance of the PV centralized system is simulated by using a time step scheme. The advantages of this system are found to be the large charging rate of power, high efficiency, and low cost compared with conventional individual PV systems and hybrid systems. In addition, the economic study shows that the life cycle cost and the price of kilowatt hour generated in the centralized system is lower than that for the individual systems. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

This complex consists of four houses with 40 flats all in all. The annual power consumption of the complex is 157 MWh and the heat requirement is 325 MWh. The concrete dynamics of the energy demands over the year is taken into consideration. The energy supply system is composed of a power-controlled combined heat and power (CHP) plant (55 kW), a photovoltaic plant (PV array or PV plant) array for power generation as well as a field of solar thermal collectors with a short-term accumulator for water heating and a long-term accumulator for supplying heat for domestic heating purposes. Simulation results demonstrate that synergetic effects result from the combination of a CHP plant with wind power and PV plants of varying sizes, which have an effect on the cost effectiveness of the plant as a whole with the different dynamics of energy sources (wind and solar energies) and of the consumption of power and heat being the decisive factors. The power deficits of wind power and PV plants are compensated through the application of a natural gas-operated CHP plant. In almost all variants, the demand for fossil energy carriers is distinctly less than in conventional energy supply plants. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Industry analysts project that photovoltaic sales will increase from their current $1.5 billion level to over $27 billion by 2020, representing an average growth rate of 25%. (Cook et al. 2000) [1]. To date, the vast majority of sales have been for navigational signals, call boxes, telecommunication centers, consumer products, off-grid electrification projects, and small grid-interactive residential rooftop applications. Building integrated photovoltaics, the integration of photovoltaic cells into one or more of the exterior surfaces of the building envelope, represents a small but growing photovoltaic application. In order for building owners, designers, and architects to make informed economic decisions regarding the use of building integrated photovoltaics, accurate predictive tools and performance data are needed. A building integrated photovoltaic test bed has been constructed at the National Institute of Standards and Technology to provide the performance data needed for model validation. The facility incorporates four identical pairs of building integrated photovoltaic panels constructed using single-crystalline, polycrystalline, silicon film, and amorphous silicon photovoltaic cells. One panel of each identical pair is installed with thermal insulation attached to its rear surface. The second paired panel is installed without thermal insulation. This experimental configuration yields results that quantify the effect of elevated cell temperature on the panels' performance for different cell technologies. This paper presents the first set of experimental results from this facility. Comparisons are made between the electrical performance of the insulated and non-insulated panels for each of the four cell technologies. The monthly and overall conversion efficiencies for each cell technology are presented and the seasonal performance variations discussed. Daily efficiencies are presented for a selected month. Finally, plots of the power output and panel temperatures are presented and discussed for the single-crystalline and amorphous silicon panels.",,"Amorphous silicon; Consumer products; Economics; Polycrystalline materials; Sales; Single crystals; Solar buildings; Thermal insulation; Building integrated photovoltaics; Photovoltaic industry; Silicon film; Photovoltaic cells","Fanney, A.H.; Natl.

One, an NGO called the Social Work and Research Centre (SWRC), has successfully installed long lasting systems. Two contributing factors to their success are the SWRC's development of a maintenance infrastructure for PV systems and Indian government standards on the design and installation of PV systems. The SWRC's success contributes to a high demand for PV among Ladakhi villagers. Local policymakers have responded by allocating money for PV. However, the focus is on installing new systems, not on building a maintenance infrastructure.

It is observed that the life cycle cost of one unit of energy from grids that are 1 km away from a village is much higher than the cost of energy from a PV system. Thus, the use of PV system is economically feasible in rural villages and remote areas of Bangladesh, where grid electricity is not available. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.The economics of stand-alone photovoltaic power system is studied to test its feasibility in remote and rural areas of Bangladesh and to compare renewable generators with non-renewable generators. The life cycle cost of these generators are determined using the method of net present value analysis. It is found that the life cycle cost of this experimental PV system is Tk. 43.40/kWh for one family (US $1.00 = Bangladeshi taka Tk.50.00). The life cycle cost for grid electricity is Tk. 20.00/kWh and Tk. 7.75/kWh for generation of fuel costs of Tk. 6.80/kWh and Tk. 0.47/kWh respectively. For a village 1 km away from the distribution line, this cost becomes Tk. 125.00/kWh for a family. For petrol generator life cycle cost is Tk. 50.00/kWh at fuel price of Tk. 22.00 per litre.

Thus, the use of PV system is economically feasible in rural villages and remote areas of Bangladesh, where grid electricity is not available.The feasibility of installing stand-alone photovoltaic power systems in the rural regions of Bangladesh was studied and compared with the installation of nonrenwable generators. Net present value analysis is used to determine the generator life cycle cost, which is estimated at Tk. 43.40/kWh, as compared with 20.00/kWh for grid electricity. The grid cost increases significantly with distance from the distribution line. The comparable gasoline generator cost is Tk 50.00/kWh, and for diesel generator it is Tk. 46/kWh. This justifies the economic installation of photovoltaic systems in remote villages.",,"Photovoltaic power system; Renewable generators; Costs; Economics; Electric power systems; Energy resources; Rural areas; Photovoltaic effects; alternative energy; economic analysis; photovoltaic system; residential energy; Bangladesh","Bhuiyan, M.M.H.; Department of Physics, Bangladesh Univ. of Eng. and Tech., Ramna, Dhaka 1000, Bangladesh",,,09601481,,RNENE,,"English","Renew.

Generation and storage units for each system are properly sized in order to meet the annual load and minimize the total annual cost to the customer. In addition, an economic analysis has been performed for the above three scenarios and is used to justify the use of renewable energy versus constructing a line extension from the nearest existing power line to supply the load with conventional power.

A case study of Hawaii's fuel-energy balance by the end of the 21st century which features two scenarios, a 'Business-as-Usual' energy system, based on imported fossil fuels, and a 'Renewable-Energy' scenario, based on an alternative energy system consisting entirely of indigenous, renewable energy resources, is presented. In the year 2100, a projected total energy consumption of approximately 335 million gigajoules would be provided from a hypothetical renewable-energy system of approximately 13 gigawatts-electric of installed capacity. This system would feature methanol-from-biomass to meet liquid fuel requirements for surface transportation, industrial, commercial, and residential sectors; hydrogen via electrolysis in liquid form for air transportation and as a gaseous fuel for industrial purposes; and electricity generated from geothermal, ocean thermal, wind, and photovoltaic sources for all power applications. A comprehensive economic analysis, including capital costs, operating and maintenance costs, air pollution costs for the total fuel cycle of each energy system, and a local multiplier effect factor of 3·75 per dollar, indicates that between the years of 1987 and 2100 the 'Business-as-Usual' scenario will have expended approximately $600 billion (1986 US dollars), and the 'Renewable-Energy' scenario will have cost approximately $400 billion. By switching from imported fossil fuels to indigenous, renewable energy resources during this time period, Hawaii's citizens could save approximately $200 billion to help preserve paradise. © 1994.",,"energy balance; future scenario; oil replacement; renewable energy; USA, Hawaii","Phillips, V.D.; Hawaii Natural Energy Institute, University of Hawaii at Manoa, Honolulu, HI 96822, United States",,,03062619,,APEND,,"English","Appl.

Large-scale renewable generation does not reduce fuel poverty because citizens still have to pay for their imported energy. However, building-integrated solar systems do reduce the amount of energy imported into homes and have demonstrably already taken some families out of fuel poverty in Scotland. This study is of the solar potential of Dundee, a city with higher than average levels of fuel poverty. A review of the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation presents the deprivation status of the population in the centre of the city. The total roof area practically available for solar integration was estimated using RoofRay software. Energy efficiency measures, combined with building integrated solar systems were shown to potentially eliminate fuel poverty in central Dundee. Energetic and economic analyses of the solar systems using TRNSYS software resulted in optimal PV/inverter system sizing ratios of 1.02 and 1.06, respectively.
