It has also been linked to an increase in behavioural, affective and cognitive student engagement, the facilitation of which is a central concern of educators. In order to delineate the complex nexus of technology and student engagement, this article systematically maps research from 243 studies published between 2007 and 2016. Research within the corpus was predominantly undertaken within the United States and the United Kingdom, with only limited research undertaken in the Global South, and largely focused on the fields of Arts & Humanities, Education, and Natural Sciences, Mathematics & Statistics. Studies most often used quantitative methods, followed by mixed methods, with little qualitative research methods employed. Few studies provided a definition of student engagement, and less than half were guided by a theoretical framework. The courses investigated used blended learning and text-based tools (e.g. discussion forums) most often, with undergraduate students as the primary target group. Stemming from the use of educational technology, behavioural engagement was by far the most often identified dimension, followed by affective and cognitive engagement. This mapping article provides the grounds for further exploration into discipline-specific use of technology to foster student engagement. © 2020, The Author(s).","Educational technology; Evidence map; Higher education; Student engagement; Systematic review",,"Abdool, P.S., Nirula, L., Bonato, S., Rajji, T.K., Silver, I.L., Simulation in undergraduate psychiatry: Exploring the depth of learner engagement (2017) Academic Psychiatry: the Journal of the American Association of Directors of Psychiatric Residency Training and the Association for Academic Psychiatry, 41 (2), pp. 251-261; Alioon, Y., Delialioğlu, Ö., The effect of authentic m-learning activities on student engagement and motivation (2017) British Journal of Educational Technology, 32, p. 121; Alrasheedi, M., Capretz, L.F., Raza, A., A systematic review of the critical factors for success of mobile learning in higher education (university students’ perspective) (2015) Journal of Educational Computing Research, 52 (2), pp. 257-276; Al-Sakkaf, A., Omar, M., Ahmad, M., A systematic literature review of student engagement in software visualization: A theoretical perspective (2019) Computer Science Education, 29 (2-3), pp. 283-309; Andrew, L., Ewens, B., Maslin-Prothero, S., Enhancing the online learning experience using virtual interactive classrooms (2015) Australian Journal of Advanced Nursing, 32 (4), pp. 22-31; Antonenko, P.D., The instrumental value of conceptual frameworks in educational technology research (2015) Educational Technology Research and Development, 63 (1), pp. 53-71; Appleton, J.J., Christenson, S.L., Furlong, M.J., Student engagement with school: Critical conceptual and methodological issues of the construct (2008) Psychology in the Schools, 45 (5), pp. 369-386; Arnold, N., Paulus, T., Using a social networking site for experiential learning: Appropriating, lurking, modeling and community building (2010) Internet and Higher Education, 13 (4), pp. 188-196; Astin, A.W., Student involvement: A developmental theory for higher education (1984) Journal of College Student Development, 25 (4), pp. 297-308; Astin, A.W., Student involvement: A developmental theory for higher education (1999) Journal of College Student Development, 40 (5), pp. 518-529. , https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220017441, Original work published July 1984; Atmacasoy, A., Aksu, M., Blended learning at pre-service teacher education in Turkey: A systematic review (2018) Education and Information Technologies, 23 (6), pp. 2399-2422; Azevedo, R., Defining and measuring engagement and learning in science: Conceptual, theoretical, methodological, and analytical issues (2015) Educational Psychologist, 50 (1), pp. 84-94; Bandura, A., (1971) Social learning theory, , General Learning Press, New York; Barak, M., Are digital natives open to change?

The open collaborative platform focused on the nature of the Web 2.0 era which is using associated tool for education technology, participation of students, and interactive approach. Higher education institution is challenged to become more creative to create an interactive learning platform. One of the trending solutions is used social learning platform, which combines learning technology with the social me- dia environment. Social learning as learning method combines multiple media that are designed to complement the learning platform. The purpose of this study is to identify how social media could implement as an interactive tool to support blended learning in a higher education institution. The methodology of this study using design science re- search to identify the appropriate social learning system model which consists of seven stages: design as an artifact, problem relevance, design evaluation, research contribution, research rigor, design as a search process, and communication of research. The result of this study provides a social learning systems application as a tool for higher education institutions to increase learning experience in terms of participation and collaborative learning.

The methodology allows for identification and interpretation of self-regulated learning in terms of the use of learning strategies. The main advantage of the new technique over the existing ones is that it combines the time management and learning tactic dimensions of learning strategies, which are typically studied in isolation. The new technique allows for novel insights into learning strategies by studying the frequency of, strength of connections between, and ordering and time of execution of time management and learning tactics. The technique was validated in a study that was conducted on the trace data of first-year undergraduate students who were enrolled into two consecutive offerings (N2017 = 250 and N2018 = 232) of a course at an Australian university. The application of the proposed technique identified four strategy groups derived from three distinct time management tactics and five learning tactics. The tactics and strategies identified with the technique were correlated with academic performance and were interpreted according to the established theories and practices of self-regulated learning. © 2020 Association for Computing Machinery.","Blended learning; Learning analytics; Learning strategies; Self-regulated learning; Time management strategies","E-learning; Hierarchical clustering; Students; Blended learning; Learning analytics; Learning strategy; Self-regulated learning; Time management; Learning systems","Abrami, P.C., Bernard, R.M., Bures, E.M., Borokhovski, E., Tamim, R.M., Interaction in distance education and online learning: Using evidence and theory to improve practice (2011) Journal of Computing in Higher Education, 23 (2-3), pp. 82-103. , (2011); Ahmad Uzir, N., Gašević, D., Matcha, W., Jovanović, J., Pardo, A., Analytics of time management strategies in a flipped classroom (2019) Journal of Computer Assisted Learning, , (2019); Ahmad Uzir, N., Gašević, D., Matcha, W., Jovanović, J., Pardo, A., Lim, L., Gentili, S., Discovering time management strategies in learning processes using process mining techniques (2019) European Conference on Technology Enhanced Learning., pp. 555-569. , Springer; Azevedo, R., Cromley, J.G., Does training on self-regulated learning facilitate students' learning with hypermedia?

In the master course Agile Software Architectures it was decided to use the Blended Learning modality. It is relevant, therefore, to know the students’ perception of this modality, not only while taking the course but after having seen it. This article analyzes the students’ perception of the Agile Software Architectures course taught at University de los Andes. The perception of the students was measured through an anonymous survey of the students who were enrolled in the course for the periods 2015-2018. The results showed that 39.7% of the respondents considered that they learned better compared to face-to-face courses. Additionally, the most valued aspect by respondents was the use of industry problems. © 2020, Associacao Iberica de Sistemas e Tecnologias de Informacao.

The article discusses blended learning form of education with a focus on an innovative approach to content creation and a recommender system of learning material in e-courses. These two interconnected parts of e-courses are analysed on both a theoretical and practical basis resulting in the design of a recommender system model reflecting technical specifications of established learning management system at the university. The effort of educators to enhance students’ learning performance is run via active involvement of students into the process of education by means of creation, presentation and evaluation of study materials. This approach is based on elaborated guiding in the virtual space, in utilizing proper tools for communication, navigation and evaluation of students’ presentations. The evaluation of students’ presentations is made in the virtual space and also during face-to-face classes, for it is the inseparable part of the recommender system and as a whole corresponds to the blended learning concept. The pilot stage of implementation of the recommender system was tested during the last academic year. Students welcomed the new approach, earlier some students felt limited by time and others by lack of knowledge to evaluate which material is worth studying. Appropriateness of the model was demonstrated by reduced failure rate at the final tests. © 2019, Beijing Normal University.","Content development; Learning environment; Rating; Recommender system; Tourism management",,"Bloom, B.S., (1956) Taxonomy of educational objectives, handbook: The cognitive domain, , David McKay, New York; Bobadilla, J., Serradilla, F., Hernando, A., Collaborative filtering adapted to recommender systems of e-learning (2009) Knowledge-Based Systems, 22, pp. 261-265; Burke, R., Hybrid recommender systems: survey and experiments (2002) User Modeling and User-Adapted Interaction, 12 (4), pp. 331-370; Cerna, M., User evaluation of geography website (2016) ECEL 2016, European conference on e-Learning, pp. 114-121. , Novotna J, (ed), Academic Conferences Ltd, Reading; Cerna, M., Utilization of social applications as a way of student’s engagement into a learning process (2017) Advanced Science Letters, 23 (4), pp. 2889-2893; Cerna, M., Psychodidactic approach in the development of language competences in university students within blended learning (2018) Open Learning: The Journal of Open, Distance and e-Learning, 33 (2), pp. 142-154; Černá, M., Borkovcová, A., Blended Learning Concept in Selected Tourism Management e-Courses with Focus on Content Development Including Recommender System (2018) Lecture Notes in Computer Science, pp. 175-187. , Springer International Publishing, Cham; Černá, M., Poulová, P., Reflection of Comenius’ didactic principles in ESP instruction (2013) ICIBET 2013: International Conference on Information, Business and Education Technology, 28, pp. 553-556. , Advances in Intelligent Systems Research, Paris: Atlantis Press; Cheung, S.K.S., Distance-Learning Students’ Perception on Usefulness of Open Educational Resources (2017) ICBL 2017, Blended Learning.

Thus, there is need for institutional-based research to guide universities, colleges, and polytechnics to strategically diffuse BL. Accordingly, this study develops a model to investigate the variables and associated factors that influence institutions' administration readiness to diffuse BL initiatives based on Diffusion of Innovation (DoI) theory and institutional BL adoption framework that comprises of mature implementation stage of BL. Quantitative research approach was employed and data was collected using online survey questionnaire from 223 e-learning administrators/managers in Malaysia universities, colleges, and polytechnics. Next, Partial Least Square-Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) technique was employed for data analysis. Results indicate that institutional structure, resource support, technology infrastructure, management strategies, and ethical considerations are key variables that positively predict administration readiness to diffuse BL initiatives in higher education. Additional results from Importance Performance Map Analysis (IPMA) in PLS-SEM suggest that institutional structure has the strongest effect on administrators’ readiness to diffuse BL and is also the most important variable that influences BL diffusion in institutions. Theoretically, findings from this study provide insights on how institutions’ administration perception and acceptance of BL approach can be enhanced. Practically, the developed model can be employed as a readiness tool to assess institutions current state in implementing BL environment and further provides a road map for future improvement. © 2019, © 2019 ISTE.","administration readiness; blended learning; higher education policy; institutional diffusion; Technology in education",,"Ahmed, H.M.S., Hybrid E‐Learning acceptance model: Learner perceptions (2010) Decision Sciences Journal of Innovative Education, 8 (2), pp. 313-346; Al-Busaidi, K.A., Learners' perspective on critical factors to LMS success in blended learning: An empirical investigation (2012) Communications of the Association for Information Systems, 30 (2), pp. 11-34; Al-Rahmi, W.M., Alias, N., Othman, M.S., Alzahrani, A.I., Alfarraj, O., Saged, A.A., Rahman, N.S.A., Use of E-learning by university students in Malaysian Higher Educational Institutions: A case in Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (2018) IEEE Access, 6, pp. 14268-14276; Alshehri, A.F., Student satisfaction and commitment towards a blended learning finance course: A new evidence from using the investment model (2017) Research in International Business and Finance, 41, pp. 423-433; Anthony, B., Jr., Green information system integration for environmental performance in organizations: An extension of belief–action–outcome framework and natural resource-based view theory (2019) Benchmarking: An International Journal, 26 (3), pp. 1033-1062; Anthony, B., Jr., Abdul Majid, M., Romli, A., A collaborative agent based green IS practice assessment tool for environmental sustainability attainment in enterprise data centers (2018) Journal of Enterprise Information Management, 31 (5), pp. 771-795; Anthony, B., Abdul Majid, M., Romli, A., Heterogeneous agent-enabled decision system for evaluating green IT performance in industrial environments (2018) Journal of Decision Systems, 27 (1), pp. 37-62; Anthony, B., Kamaludin, A., Romli, A., Raffei, A.F.M., Abdullah, A., Ming, G.L., Baba, S., Exploring the role of blended learning for teaching and learning effectiveness in institutions of higher learning: An empirical investigation (2019) Education and Information Technologies, pp. 1-34. , …; Anthony, B., Majid, M.A., Romli, A., Green IS diffusion in organizations: A model and empirical results from Malaysia (2018) Environment, Development and Sustainability, pp. 1-42; Baragash, R.S., Al-Samarraie, H., Blended learning: Investigating the influence of engagement in multiple learning delivery modes on students’ performance (2018) Telematics and Informatics, 35 (7), pp. 2082-2098; Basir, H.M., Ahmad, A., Noor, N.L.M., Institutional strategy for effective blended e-learning: HCI perspective of sustainable embedding (2010) IEEE, pp. 71-76. , Shah Alam, Malaysia:, &; Bervell, B., Umar, I.N., Blended learning or face-to-face?

This brings us to ask ourselves: what is educational quality? How do we determine whether a teaching-learning process based on Blended Learning is of high quality? What dimensions and indicators of quality can be adequate for its evaluation?

The main thesis of this chapter is that, in a scenario of academic capitalism, the widespread promotion of virtual training policies and the growth of blended learning is giving rise to similarities between public and private systems, resignifying institutional structures and creating new formulas in approaches to training processes. The work establishes a policy framework from which to study the formal instrumentalisation that is being made of new learning approaches, introducing elements of analysis so far scarcely explored in the educational context. Aspects such as the professional functionality attributed to the university lecturer in this educational model and the implications of geoterritoriality in the dissemination of blended learning constitute essential patterns of study in an approach whose convergence between public and private organisations is building a new policy of university knowledge. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","(Geo)territoriality; Blended learning; Instrumentalization of knowledge; Public–private partnerships; Social responsibility",,"https://www.unir.net/vive-unir/internacional/noticias/por-que-triunfa-el-sistema-de-educacion-universitaria-on-line-en-espana-y-colombia-replica-su-modelo/549203620780/; Gómez, J., https://www.crue.org/Publicaciones/UNIVERSITIC-2017.pdf; (2005) World Bank: Education Sector Strategy Update: Achieving Education for All, , Broadening Our Perspective, Maximizing Our Effectiveness.

In particular, by integrating formal traditional courses with informal learning approaches, MOOCs have been expanding the position as a learning platform to provide students with diverse learning experiences delivered through blended learning modalities. This chapter aims to discuss how MOOCs have been integrated into higher education contexts to blend formal, non-formal and informal learning experiences. An integration framework suggested in this chapter is based on two factors, namely credit recognition and online learning that lead to three types of MOOC-integrated learning experiences: Type I—formal MOOC learning, Type II—formal blended MOOC learning, and Type III—non-formal/informal MOOC learning. Based on this framework, we mainly illustrate three integration approaches, namely blended learning, flipped learning, and non-formal/informal learning experiences, with relevant research studies. The chapter concludes with some suggestions for research directions that can inform future research on integrating formal and non-formal/informal learning experiences through MOOCs in higher education. © 2020, The Author(s).","Blended learning; Flipped learning; Formal learning; Informal learning; MOOCs; Non-formal learning",,"Abdelrahman, A.M., MOOCs integration in the formal education (2016) International Journal for Infonomics, 9 (3), pp. 1210-1216; Akgül, Y., Accessibility evaluation of MOOCs’ websites of turkey (2018) Journal of Life Economics, 5 (4), pp. 23-36; Alraimi, K.M., Zo, H., Ciganek, A.P., Understanding the MOOCs continuance: The role of openness and reputation (2014) Computers & Education, 80, pp. 28-38; Atiaja, L., Gueerero, R., MOOCs: Origin, characterization, principal problems and challenges in higher education (2016) Journal of E-Learning and Knowledge Society, 12 (1), pp. 65-76; Baker, R.M., Passmore, D.L., Value and pricing of MOOCs (2016) Education Sciences, 6, pp. 1-11. , https://doi.org/10.3390/educsci6020014; Belanger, V., Thornton, J., (2013) Bioelectricity: A Quantitative Approach-Duke University’s First MOOC, , http://dukespace.lib.duke.edu/dspace/bitstream/handle/10161/6216/Duke_Bioelectricity_MOOC_Fall2012.pdf, Report).

However, recent literature has revealed that developing countries' educational institutions fail when they adopt LMS technologies because they ignore the human factors related to these technologies. This study investigated the impact of human factors on the effectiveness of LMS in a blended learning environment at Kuwait's HEIs (KHEIs). In this paper, a pragmatic approach consisting of quantitative and qualitative methods is used. User characteristics traits from the literature review were organized into three main indicators of human impact on the effectiveness of LMS: technological characteristics, psychological characteristics, and student-instructor interaction characteristics. After these indicators were identified, a conceptual model was developed to study the characteristics. A deductive approach was used, and the model was tested for significance through receiving feedback from the universities' students and faculty members. In addition, an inductive approach was implemented through conducting interviews to explore more factors related to the effectiveness of LMS. The inductive approach's results revealed the relevant factors for the usage of the LMS, such as training, needs, expectations, and branding. The human factors that positively affect the success and effectiveness of LMS included attitude, enjoyment, experience, self-efficacy, and promptness, which had the most substantial impacts on user satisfaction. The modified conceptual model that this paper presents includes these impacting factors and provides an acceptable fit to the data. This research has developed an updated framework for demonstrating the effectiveness of LMS as it pertains to human factors, and its findings can be used to enhance user experience in a blended learning environment, thus improving the quality of Kuwaiti education. © 2013 IEEE.","blended learning; effectiveness of LMS; human factors; Kuwait's higher education institutions; Learning management systems (LMSs)","Computer aided instruction; Developing countries; Education computing; Human engineering; Students; User experience; Blended learning; effectiveness of LMS; Higher education institutions; Learning management system; Psychological characteristics; Quantitative and qualitative methods; Student-instructor interactions; Technological characteristics; Learning systems","Nikoli, V., Petkovi, D., Deni, N., Milovanevi, M., Gavrilovi, S., Appraisal and review of e-learning and ICT systems in teaching process (2019) Phys.

The methods used for assessment are of prime pedagogical importance as they have a direct bearing on both teaching and learning provision and the learning experience. Assessment methods must be planned so that they align well with intended learning outcomes in e-assessment procedures in particular, in order to ensure reliable and secure learner authentication and authorship in online and blended learning environments. A framework for quality assurance in trust-based e-assessment processes was developed in accordance with these objectives. The framework has been designed in line with the Standards and Guidelines for Quality Assurance in the European Higher Education Area (ESG) to assure the applicability of the e-assessment system to all online and blended learning environments while respecting the shared European framework for quality assurance (QA). This chapter provides contextual information on the quality assurance of higher education in the European Higher Education Area (EHEA) and presents in more detail the rationale behind the development of the framework, together with aspects that need to be taken into consideration when designing and implementing the quality assurance of e-assessment. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.","e-assessment; e-learning; European standards and guidelines; Framework; Higher education; Quality assurance",,"https://enqa.eu/index.php/home/esg/; http://www.ehea.info/; Gaebel, M., Zhang, T., (2018) Trends 2018, , Learning and teaching in the European higher education area.

The online material mainly consists of video tutorials, other open source web tools and multi-choice self-assessment exercises. During the academic year 2016-2017, the e-Learning course was not available yet, but then the online course was first implemented (2017/18) and fully adopted (2018/2019).The online tutoring support was activated alongside a traditional general chemistry course, adopting a blended mode, with the aims of: (i) homogenizing freshmen’s chemistry knowledge; (ii) fostering the most appropriate method of study in a multi access modality; (iii) implementing the Johnstone’s three levels’ knowledge and (iv) increasing students’ self-confidence, by the means of a self-evaluation training process. Differently from previous studies, the online course herein aimed mainly to develop a correct method of study of chemistry topics, with a punctual description of what-and-how to do. The results, i.e. the exam's scores, the time spent in the platform, and the successful percentage of students per year, have been collected and analysed through qualitative and quantitative methods. Apart a general satisfaction of the students perceived by the answers to a survey questionnaire, the analysis of the data shows an increase of 11 % of students passing the final exam within three exam sessions together with an improvement and a positive correlation between the time spent on the platform and the mid-term scores achieved. © Italian e-Learning Association.","Blended Learning; Chemistry Education; ICT; Moodle; Tutorial Online",,"Abrahim, S., Mir, B.A., Suhara, H., Mohamed, F.A., Sato, M., Structural equation modeling and confirmatory factor analysis of social media use and education (2019) International Journal of Educational Technology in Higher Education, 16 (1); Bell, P., Volckmann, D., Knowledge surveys in general chemistry: Confidence, overconfidence, and performance (2011) J.

The flipped classroom involves blended learning – a combination of face-to-face in-class learning and distance learning. The flipped classroom technology implies such organization of the educational process in which students attend face-to-face classes only after they have already gained some theoretical knowledge and understanding of the materials that will be discussed in the classroom. This new approach to teaching is caused by the increasing role of self-education within the framework of cultural competence of a modern specialist because the model lends itself to active learning. The advantages presented by the flipped classroom technology are the increasing time for the individual work with students, the opportunity to provide additional cultural knowledge through a careful selection of the learning content on the one hand, as well as developing of the student’s ability to self-organization and self-education on the other. Online content, in its turn, allows time in class for problem solving and hands-on activities, converting the classroom into a place where active learning occurs. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Active learning; Blended learning; Distance learning; Flipped classroom; Foreign language teaching; Higher education; Interactive educational technologies; TED-Ed","Artificial intelligence; Distance education; Education computing; Educational technology; Knowledge management; Teaching; Classroom technology; Cultural knowledge; Educational process; Foreign language teaching; Hands-on activities; In-class learning; Innovative technology; Self organizations; Students","Baker, J.W., The “classroom flip”: Using web course management tools to become the guide by the side (2000) Selected Papers from the 11Th International Conference on College Teaching and Learning, pp. 9-17. , Chambers, J.A.

The purpose of this mixed methods study was two-fold. The first purpose was to investigate pedagogical changes that occurred as a result of the professional development that included a year-long faculty learning community by exploring influences on pedagogical changes. The second purpose was to understand the perceptions of the diffusion of innovations (DOI) characteristics that influenced the level of adoption of online/blended teaching by faculty participants. A survey was used to measure the perceived characters of innovation as defined in the theoretical framework. Following the survey, one-on-one interviews that were linked to the DOI theoretical framework were conducted to better understand those characteristics. The results presented herein focus on barriers, challenges, and successes of adopting e-learning pedagogy in these online and blended learning environments. © 2020, The Online Learning Consortium.

This makes it possible to significantly raise the level of education for those universities in which there is no opportunity to attract personnel of the right qualifications to organise classes according to the traditional version. Usually, such programs use MOOCs on national platforms (openedu.ru in Russia, for example) or international platforms such as Coursera. In terms of obtaining theoretical knowledge, this approach looks very attractive, but the possibilities of providing practical tasks and using specialised software are limited by the framework of the particular online platform. And this is a barrier for the universities to join the network programs that require specialised software as a hands-on practice tool. The solution to overcome this barrier can be in using of a hybrid learning approach, when students acquire the theoretical knowledge in the form of a MOOC and have practical assignments either at their universities, if there is an appropriate material base (software access), or using cloud-based SaaS services owned by partner organisations. The article gives an overview of the SPbPU's experience in developing this “hybrid model” of online courses for studying SAP-related technologies and solutions, its economic value and use cases for incorporating SAP-related technologies and solutions in the educational process, taking into account the current state of the education market for SAP technologies.

This was a controversial decision politically and a challenging one practically. From the perspective of the academics at the University of Cape Town (UCT), this paper draws on interviews with educators in three broad disciplinary areas to explore their views, practices, and experiences regarding the use of online materials in these unique circumstances. Activity Theory provides a framework to consider the issues systemically and to identify the tensions and contradictions in the system. © 2019, The Author(s).","#FeesMustFall; Activity theory; Blended learning; Contestations; Online education; Protests; South Africa; University of Cape Town",,"Adam, T., Digital neocolonialism and massive open online courses (MOOCs): colonial pasts and neoliberal futures (2019) Learning, Media and Technology, 44 (3), pp. 365-380; Badat, S., Deciphering the meanings and explaning the South African higher education students protests of 2015–16 (2016) Student and Scholar Protests in Africa Pax Academica, , Nyamjoh, F., Dakar, Senegal, Codesria; Bali, M., Caines, A., A call for promoting ownership, equity, and agency in faculty development via connected learning (2018) Int J Educ Technol Higher Educ, 15. , &, (,).,.,., https://doi.org/10.1186/s41239-018-0128-8; Booysen, S., Fees must fall: Student revolt (2016) Decolonisation and Governance in South Africa, , Johannesburg, Wits University Press; Bosch, T., Twitter activism and youth in South Africa: the case of #RhodesMustFall (2016) Information, Communication & Society, 20 (2), pp. 221-232; Boyd, D., What would Paulo Freire think of blackboard: Critical pedagogy in an age of online learning (2016) Int J Crit Pedagogy, 7 (1), pp. 165-186. , http://libjournal.uncg.edu/ijcp/article/view/1055/892, Retrieved from; (2016) South African Higher Education Reviewed: Two Decades of Democracy, , https://www.che.ac.za/sites/default/files/publications/CHE_South%20African%20higher%20education%20reviewed%20-%20electronic.pdf, Pretoria: CHE; Chikane, R., Breaking a rainbow (2018) Building a Nation: The Politics behind #Mustfall Movements, , Johannesburg, Pan Macmillan; (2016) South African Higher Education Reviewed: Two Decades of Democracy, , Council on Higher Education, Pretoria; Czerniewicz, L., Brown, C., A study of the relationship between institutional policy, organisational culture and e-learning use in four South African universities (2009) Computers & Education, 53 (1), pp. 121-131; Czerniewicz, L., Haupt, G., Blended learning in challenging circumstances – The case of UCT (2018) Presented at the Carnegie Foundation Blended Learning Seminar, , www.siyaphumelela.org.za/documents/5c1234b7e354b.pdf, Ekurhuleni, South Africa, 1 June 2018; de Wet, T., van Rooyen, C., Frahm-Arp, M., Joshi, H., One tweak at a time: University of Johannesburg (2018) Presented at the Carnegie Foundation Blended Learning Seminar, , www.siyaphumelela.org.za/documents/5c1235670705c.pdf, Ekurhuleni, South Africa, 1 June 2018; (2018) Statistics on Post-School Education and Training in South Africa: 2016, , www.dhet.gov.za/DHET%20Statistics%20Publication/Statistics%20on%20Post-School%20Education%20and%20Training%20in%20South%20Africa%202016.pdf; Engeström, Y., (1987) Learning by expanding: An activity theoretical approach to developmental research, , Orienta-Konsultit, Helsinki; Fitzgerald, P., Seale, O., Between a rock and a hard place: University management and the #FeesMustFall campaign (2016) Fees must fall: Student revolt, decolonisation and governance in South Africa, pp. 235-255. , Booysen S, (ed), Wits University Press, Johannesburg; Habib, A., (2019) Rebels and rage: Reflecting on #FeesMustFall, , Jonathan Ball, Johannesburg; Hayes, S., Jandrić, P., Who is Really in Charge of Contemporary Education?

This article describes the evaluation phase of a blended course of English for general academic purposes (EGAP) targeting second-year undergraduate Japanese students mostly from the Faculties of Law, Letters, Economics, and Human Sciences at Osaka University. In this study, the researchers adopted an inclusive approach to blended course evaluation. In order to ensure the course quality from the outset, the Fifth Edition of Quality Matters Higher Education Course Design Rubric was utilized as the major reference. As part of the evaluation process, students’ perception on the usefulness of the course was also measured quantitatively and qualitatively through an attitudinal survey instrument and open ended reflection questions. Eventually, to add an outsider positionality, the blended course was peer-reviewed by a certified reviewer from Quality Matters (QM) after having been self-reviewed by the researchers. The findings of the evaluation survey demonstrated students’ overall satisfaction with the course, and their responses to the open-ended questions provided further insight into the educational and technical difficulties they encountered. The QM peer review also yielded a score of 70 out of 99, resulting in failure to meet the essential standards. However, comments from the peer reviewer guided the refinements and improvement of the course design, and the course currently meets all the requirements of the Higher Education Course Design Rubric (Fifth Edition) upon amendment. This study discusses the implications for design, development, and evaluation of English-as-a-foreign-language blended courses and provides practical tips for online/blended course designers. Further refinements to the existing course can be made in the future by implementing it several times with various groups of students. © 2019, The Author(s).","Blended learning; English for general academic purposes; Evaluation; Quality Matters",,"Adair, D., A process to improve course design: A key variable in course quality (2014) Assuring Quality in Online Education: Practices and Processes at the Teaching, Resource, and Program Levels, pp. 81-90. , K.

Surveys are traditions of collecting data that has become the voice of the customer relayed and conveyed anonymously or blatantly. Various learning institutions, mostly universities at large, has made it customary to allow students answer surveys intended to collect views on their overall assessment covering their satisfaction in the entire course as the semester concludes. In Jose Rizal University, student feedback is collected in various survey formats. One of which is called the Canvas Learning Experience survey that provides opportunity to the learners to comment on the proficiency of the implementation of the blended learning course. It seeks student comments on specific areas for improvement in the teaching and learning process. The conveyance of whether these students are immensely satisfied with their learning environment and experience matters mostly to the university treating them as customers and partners. One of the significant objectives of this research is to develop a blended learning feedback mining system that empowers the educational institution administration to inspect at the reproaches of their clients’ learning experience in the blended learning course and thus upgrade them accordingly. The conceptual framework of this research centers on catching and investigating criticism information from students’ perceptions basing from their qualitative comments using text mining. In turn, the framework will give the fundamental structure in the implementation of the feedback mining system that the university may utilize for addressing the results of the Canvas Experience survey. © ICCE 2019 - 27th International Conference on Computers in Education, Proceedings.

In spite of problems related to ICT hardware and software, limited instructional materials, resistance to organizational change, issues on how to make course content more engaging, and issues on effective learning pedagogy, the result of the study revealed that the e-learning platform satisfactorily complied with the usability issues and students were satisfied in using the platform as support to learning. Also, the test of the gain score (posttest-pretest) indicates a significant difference between the two treatment groups which reveals that increasing the academic performance of the students through the e-learning is an important factor. Furthermore, the proposed e-Learning platform is a timely contribution to improve and support the academic practices of both teaching and learning practices at the University. © 2019, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

This transformation comes in the wake of the end consumer of technical institutions: the industry, wanting a more creative, innovative, thinking, strongly communicative workforce. Therefore, looking for a more individualistic, change-oriented and opinionated individual. The age old method of lecture or face to face interaction does not become irrelevant but needs to be in semblance with the present environment of learning and teaching. In today’s world technology has a definitive part in the lives of students be it in the classroom or outside therefore the teaching plans need to have technology and learners need to be adept in them for technology based skill is a valid and mandatory industry skill (Pearson & Thomas, 2002). In coming years as learners and the faculty are going to use and create a semblance of technology it is bound to grow more in the classroom as learning tools. (Dahlstrom, Walker, & Dziuban, 2013).

Both approaches to learning when arranged correctly, improve students learning and engagement towards the course. When using IBL, one of the main problems that students experience is the selection of their class project. We propose a methodology based on funding opportunity announcements (FOA) to aid in the selection process. Student groups are able to quickly compare and match their skills and interests to market demand as expressed by groups such as NIH or NSF. The students in the class experience a blended approach; they collaborate online and in-class, and they apply knowledge acquired from online content to their main project. In this blended approach, FOAs act as a catalyst to students' learning; it both focuses them at the beginning and motivates them throughout the course. Students in this MOOC-enabled learning ecosystem grow in their intrinsic motivation and engagement. Furthermore, FOAs project selection solves scalability issues when dealing with inter-disciplinary projects and availability of proper experts/mentors for students. This tailored combination improves efficiency and targets project's relevance, which makes it very attractive to higher education administrators. © 2019 IEEE.","blended learning; FOA; IBL; MOOC; PBL","Catalysts; Computer aided instruction; Approaches to learning; Blended learning; Funding opportunities; Intrinsic motivation; Learning ecosystems; Massive open online course; MOOC; Students' projects; Students","North, S.M., Richardson, R., North, M.M., To Adapt MOOCS, or Not?

OER (Open Educational Resources) and MOOC (Massive Open Online Courses), Virtual Learning Environments (VLEs) are discussed. Experimental engineering skills and abilities can be developed by using remote labs and simulations. The development of critical thinking of engineer students takes place while students work with virtual resources, and students need to understand what kind of results they get for each experiment. Even if it addresses the same problems-by differentiating the simulation laboratories-it focuses on another field: not the ability to do this, but how you can do it. Online laboratories are also fundamental to the experiments the student performs in the individual study because they are specially designed for distance students who need to gain an introductory knowledge and familiarity with real-life phenomena. The instructional design model is based on the ADDIE model, which includes the phases of analysis, design, development, implementation, and evaluation. VLEs are used to make online interactions between Students and Teachers. Moodle (Modular Object-Oriented Dynamic Learning Environment) is known as an online course management system (CMS). Learning Process and Content Management Systems (LCMS), in this case, Moodle (an open source software platform for e-learning), provides instructors with the tools to create e-learning or Blended Teaching and Learning (BTL) course. The article provides resources and information to help educators, administrators, and decision-makers better apply ITC in Engineering Education (EE) programs. The resources were analyzed by the Faculty of Electrical Engineering ('Gh. Asachi' Technical University from Iaşi, Romania) with extensive experience in integrating ICT (information and communication technology) in the training programs of engineering teachers. © 2019 IEEE.","blended teaching and learning model for engineering education;

The empirical work was carried out following a mixed methodological design of sequential derivative type of status equivalence. The quantitative information was collected with an ad hoc questionnaire to which 980 university teachers replied; of these, 86 openly expressed their opinion about these methodologies. In order to integrate the results of the QUANT-QUAL analysis, a SWOT analysis was carried out in which university teachers expressed the weaknesses, threats, strengths and opportunities of Blended Learning at universities-at both an internal and external level. © 2019, Associacao Iberica de Sistemas e Tecnologias de Informacao.

These changes pose fresh challenges to the prevalent education systems all over the world, which already have fallen short of the expectations. The purpose of this study is to show that e-learning is not only about ICT following a holistic approach to learning which embeds systemic approach and learning loops but also about students and teacher’s actions in ICT-enabled learning environment. This study investigates the importance of engagement of students and teachers in blended learning with a focus on factors which affect this engagement. Design/methodology/approach: Based on systems theory and socio-technological approach to e-learning, the paper documents an experiment which was carried out in a higher education institution. Postgraduate students of one course were divided into two groups. Instructor of the first group was not required to engage with the online content and had to deliver his course in a traditional face-to-face format. Instructor of the second group continuously spent time on the learning management system (LMS), developing more content, participating in online discussions and responding to students. LMS tracked the online activity of both the instructors, and semi-structured interviews of students were conducted. Findings: Based on behaviour of 152 students of a postgraduate programme, students’ time spent online is directly proportional to the instructor’s online time, promptness of instructor’s response to online activities queries of students increased student engagement, the students’ engagement increases if the online content is related to the syllabus but engagement is not the same as the face-to-face lectures in the class. Research limitations/implications: The research was conducted in India and is based on the behaviour of instructors and students in India. It was focussed on engagement issues of blended learning, while other issues of blended learning have not been in the focus of the research. Practical implications: The research is important for the practice of higher education, and the result of the study can be taken into consideration while developing online courses for students enrolled in higher education. Social implications: If higher education institutions take a strategic decision to use ICT in e-learning, engagements of participants and factors affecting engagement are crucial for the better quality of education. In such a way, blended learning fulfils requirements of a holistic approach to learning. Originality/value: Despite the fact that e-learning as a way to deliver academic content has been extensively researched, there are not many studies focussed on engagement issues in blended learning, and even fewer studies have been conducted in an experimental way which allow in-depth research. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Blended learning; E-learning; Experimental research; Students’ engagement; Systems theory; Teachers’ engagement","Computer aided instruction; Curricula; Information use; Students; System theory; Teaching; Blended learning; Design/methodology/approach; Experimental research; Higher education institutions; Information and Communication Technologies; Learning management system; Postgraduate students; Semi structured interviews; E-learning","(2019) Free online course on swayam by faculties and universities from, , https://swayam.gov.in/About, (accessed: 9 January 2019; Anderson, A., Huttenlocher, D., Kleinberg, J., Leskovec, J., (2014) Engaging with massive online courses, , www.cs.cornell.edu/home/kleinber/www14-courses.pdf, (accessed: 11 April 2018; (2010) Annual status of education report (rural) 2009, , http://img.asercentre.org/docs/Publications/ASER%20Reports/ASER_2009/Aser2009ReportFull.pdf, (accessed: 8 February 2018; Barnett, E.A., Validation experiences and persistence among community college students (2011) The Review of Higher Education, 34 (2), pp. 193-230; Blazun, H., Bobek, S., Sternad Zabukovšek, S., Kokol, P., Openness and information technology: a bibliometric analysis of literature production (2017) Kybernetes, 46 (5), pp. 750-766; Blazun, H., Kokol, P., Bobek, S., Železnik, D., Završnik, J., A bibliometric retrospective of the journal computers in human behavior (1991-2015) (2016) Computers in Human Behavior, 65, pp. 46-58; Carini, R.M., Kuh, G.D., Klein, S.P., Student engagement and student learning: testing the linkages (2006) Research in Higher Education, 47 (1), pp. 1-32; Chen, K.-C., Jang, S.-J., Motivation in online learning: testing a model of self-determination theory (2010) Computers in Human Behavior, 26 (4), pp. 741-752. , https://doi.org/10.1016/J.CHB.2010.01.011; Czerniewicz, L., Deacon, A., Small, J., Walji, S., Developing world MOOCs: a curriculum view of the MOOC landscape (2014) Journal of Global Literacies, Technologies, and Emerging Pedagogies, 2 (3), pp. 122-139; Drossos, L., Vassiliadis, B., Stefani, A., Xenos, M., Sakkopoulos, E., Tsakalidis, A., Introducing ICT in traditional higher education environment: background, design and evaluation of a blended approach (2006) International Journal of Information and Communication Technology Education, 2 (1), pp. 65-78; Dziuban, C., Moskal, P., (2011) A course is a course is a course: factor invariance in student evaluation of online, blended and face-to-face learning environments, , www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1096751611000388, The Internet and Higher Education; Fassinger, R., Morrow, S.L., Toward best practices in quantitative, qualitative, and mixed- method resea…: at UPES LIBRARY (2013) Journal for Social Action in Counseling and Psychology, 5 (2), pp. 69-83. , http://eds.a.ebscohost.com/eds/detail/detail?vid=0&sid=40a3f896-b989-41b4-bf45-16771ecefe37%40sessionmgr4008&bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWRzLWxpdmU%3D#AN=93598272&db=asx; (2012) FICCI higher education summit 2012: higher education in India: twelfth five year and beyond, , http://ficci.in/sedocument/20244/recommendations-2012.pdf, (accessed, 11 April 2018; Friedman, T., Come the revolution (2012) New York Times, 5 (12); Galvis, Á.H., Supporting decision-making processes on blended learning in higher education: literature and good practices review (2018) International Journal of Educational Technology in Higher Education, 15 (1), p. 25. , https://doi.org/10.1186/s41239-018-0106-1; Garrison, D.R., Kanuka, H., Blended learning: nncovering its transformative potential in higher education (2004) The Internet and Higher Education, 7 (2), pp. 95-105; Garrison, D.R., Anderson, T., Archer, W., Critical thinking, cognitive presence, and computer conferencing in distance education (2001) American Journal of Distance Education, 15 (1), pp. 7-23. , https://doi.org/10.1080/08923640109527071; (2019) Weblet importer, , http://planningcommission.nic.in/plans/planrel/fiveyr/9th/vol2/v2c3-3.htm, (accessed: 9 January 2019; Graham, C.R., Emerging practice and research in blended learning (2013) Handbook of Distance Education, pp. 333-350. , Moore, M.G.

Furthermore, higher educational institutes are finding solutions to create more personalized learning environments. There is an opportunity to improve the learning environment by applying Learning Analytics to educational data generated by learners interacting with Virtual Learning Environments (VLEs) and other digital learning tools. More personalized learning environments can be implemented by applying Learning Analytics on Learning Designs. Students' learning progress can be captured through Learning Dashboards in real-time by applying Learning Analytics during the course run-time. We can improve Blended Learning through the synergy between Learning Analytics and Learning Design. This paper provides an outline of a research project which aims to link Learning Design with Learning Analytics in order to enhance the learning environments and improve both teachers and student satisfaction.

Design/methodology/approach: A cross-sectional, cross-country survey study (n=319) was conducted recruiting participants from one North American and two British universities. The survey data and the conceptual model have been analysed and tested using confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modelling. Findings: Participants displayed positive attitudes towards the 3D game and responded positively to theory presented as “real-life” scenarios; gamification techniques such as interactions and dialogue, and rewards and progression levels, which are part of the game, albeit the participants’ adoption was driven more by extrinsic motivations (rewards) than intrinsic ones (ease of use and entertainment). In addition, the empirical results suggest that when gender is taken into account, the perceptions and needs of cross-cultural learners in serious gaming environments vary and display characteristics that are similar to Rogers’ five adopter categories; thus, culture could significantly shape learners’ decisions to adopt a serious game as a managerial learning tool. Research limitations/implications: For future researchers, this paper highlights various levels of training, support and promotional awareness that need to be considered to facilitate the adoption of serious games for managerial learning. Practical implications: For academics and practitioners in work-based learning and managerial training environments, this paper highlights the salient factors that need to be inherent in a serious 3D game, and best practices for scaffolding existing instructional approaches or training interventions. Originality/value: In light of Rogers’ five adopter categories, this cross-country study involving culturally diverse learners provides key insight into the potential application of serious games as a practice-based learning instrument in academia and industry. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Adoption theory; Blended learning; Cross-cultural issue; Practice-based learning; Serious games; Technology adoption; Technology-mediated andragogy",,"Adler, N.J., Leading beautifully: the creative economy and beyond (2011) Journal of Management Inquiry, 20 (3), pp. 208-221; Afari, E., Aldridge, J.M., Fraser, B.J., Khine, M.S., Students perceptions of the learning environment and attitudes in game-based mathematics classrooms (2013) Learning Environments Research, 16 (1), pp. 131-150; Agarwal, R., Karahanna, E., Time flies when you’re having fun: cognitive absorption and beliefs about information technology usage (2000) MIS Quarterly, 24 (4), pp. 665-694; Ajzen, I., (1988) Attitudes, Personality and Behavior, , Open University Press, Milton Keynes; Ajzen, I., Perceived behavioral control, self-efficacy, locus of control, and the theory of planned behavior (2002) Journal of Applied Social Psychology, 32 (4), pp. 665-683; Alavi, M., Yoo, Y., Vogel, D.R., Using information technology to add value to management education (1997) Academy of Management, 40 (6), pp. 1310-1333; Allal-Chérif, O., Makhlouf, M., Using serious games to manage knowledge: the SECI model perspective (2016) Journal of Business Research, 69 (5), pp. 1539-1543; Al-Senaidi, S., Lin, L., Poirot, J., Barriers to adopting technology for teaching and learning in Oman (2009) Computers & Education, 53 (3), pp. 575-590; Anderson, J.C., Gerbing, D.W., Assumptions and comparative strengths of the two-step approach comment on Fornell and Yi (1992) Sociological Methods & Research, 20 (3), pp. 321-333; Arbaugh, J., DeArmond, S., Rau, B.L., New uses for existing tools?

This research first developed a framework for quantitatively assessing teachers’ online participation in BL, and then evaluated it with data produced by 7272 teachers in 15,128 BL courses in six universities across China. This evaluation adopted a mixed methods design to investigate the intensity, regularity and interactivity of these teachers’ online participation in BL. Three key findings emerged: 1) the framework effectively assessed the degrees and features of teachers’ online participation in BL implementation, 2) these results advanced our understanding of BL adoption stages, and 3) the proposed framework proved to be technically adequate in assessing teachers’ online participation in BL at an institutional level. Using this framework, institutions could gain a fuller picture of their BL implementation so as to refine their strategies and advance their BL agenda. © 2019","Blended learning; Blended learning adoption stages; Online teaching presence; Quantitative analysis, framework proposal; Teacher online participation","Computer applications; Internet; Blended learning; Higher education; Interactivity; Mixed method; Online participation; Online teaching; Quantitative assessments; E-learning","Allen, I.E., Seaman, J., Sizing the opportunity: The quality and extent of online education in the United States, 2002 and 2003 (2003) Sloan Consortium (NJ1), p. 6; Ally, M., Foundations of educational theory for online learning (2008) Theory and practice of online learning, pp. 15-44. , T.

In that sense, this study investigates the perceptual assessments that students have about the characteristics of the RSU in a public university in southern Peru. Following a quantitative approach, information was collected from 326 students from different academic areas, through the Evaluation Questionnaire. The results showed the high reliability of the instrument. Additionally, the favorable perception of the characteristics of the RSU implemented in the university was recognized, which resulted in a high commitment to social change in the direction proposed by (Retolaza, 2010). In the same way, they found that these results do not show differences in the favorable perception to the characteristics of the RSU, we conclude that these aspects are irrelevant in the assessment made by the students. © 2019, Associacao Iberica de Sistemas e Tecnologias de Informacao.

The incorporation of sustainability into doctoral programs can be promoted using new learning methods through the practices carried out by the PhD students. These methods include learning by doing, blended learning, collaborative learning, and project based learning, all of which are presented in the practical experience described in this article. This study describes the training that students receive in the doctoral program “Energy Efficiency and Sustainability in Engineering and Architecture,” which is offered in the Engineering School at the University of Vigo. The study includes an analysis of the facility and its operations, the teaching methods used and the students' perceptions of sustainability's incorporation into the program. In this practice, students worked with an experimental facility that could be controlled and supervised both manually and remotely. Students performed numerous tasks, including studying the main problems related to the combustion of biomass and its impact on sustainable development. On the one hand, students have used different measuring devices to control and monitor facilities, and, on the other hand, they have discussed and analyzed data, thereby improving the work capacity with the facility equipment, team work skill and communication with each other effectively. As a conclusion, students showed sincere interest in development of the practice, and they participated actively in each of its phases. The learning methodology used was found to increase student motivation. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","biomass; combustion; engineering teaching; learning methods; sustainability","Biomass; Combustion; Data communication equipment; Energy efficiency; Engineering education; Facilities; Learning systems; Sustainable development; Collaborative learning; Control and monitor; Engineering schools; Engineering teachings; Experimental facilities; Learning methods; Practical experience; Project based learning; Students","Lozano, R., Lukman, R., Lozano, F.J., Huisingh, D., Lambrechts, W., Declarations for sustainability in higher education: becoming better leaders, through addressing the university system (2013) J Cleaner Prod, 48, pp. 10-19; Crespo, B., Míguez-Álvarez, C., Arce, M.E., Cuevas, M., Míguez, J.L., The sustainable development goals: an experience on higher education (2017) Sustainability, 9 (8), p. 1353; Regueiro, A., Patiño, D., Míguez, C., Cuevas, M., A practice for engineering students based on the control and monitoring an experimental biomass combustor using labview (2017) Computer Applications in Engineering Education, 25 (3), pp. 392-403; Barth, M., Godemann, J., Rieckmann, M., Stoltenberg, U., Developing key competencies for sustainable development in higher education (2007) International Journal of Sustainability in Higher Education, 8 (4), pp. 416-430; Van Poeck, K., Vandenabeele, J., Learning from sustainable development: education in the light of public issues (2012) Environmental Education Research, 18 (4), pp. 541-552; Mälkki, H., Paatero, J.V., Curriculum planning in energy engineering education (2015) J Cleaner Prod, 106, pp. 292-299; Yoon, T.K., Kim, S., Takano, T., Yun, S.-J., Son, Y., Contributing to sustainability education of East Asian university students through a field trip experience: A social-ecological perspective (2016) Sustainability, 8 (10), p. 1067; Sterling, S., Learning for resilience, or the resilient learner?

In a time of higher education massification, it is necessary to find solutions that enable universities to accommodate a fast-growing number of students within their limited budgets. For courses in electrical and electronics and related engineering fields, the solution proposed in this paper is the development of e-Engineering courses, courses that use remote laboratories in combination with e-learning methodologies to deliver an effective training experience. The effectuality of this approach and the willingness to extend it is supported in the results of two projects that are presented in this paper. © 2019 IEEE.","e-Engineering; e-learning; remote laboratories","Budget control; Curricula; E-learning; Embedded systems; Laboratories; Learning systems; Blended learning; E-engineering; E-learning methodologies; Engineering fields; Higher education; Laboratory class; Remote laboratories; Training experiences; Engineering education","IEEE Standard Digital Interface for Programmable Instrumentation, , IEEE Standard; IEEE Standard Codes, Formats, Protocols, and Common Commands for Use with IEEE Std 488.1-1987, , IEEE Standard; LAN eXtensions for Instrumentation The LXI Consortium, 2019, , http://www.lxistandard.org/, [Accessed: Feb. 16 2019]; García-Zubia, J., Hernandez, U., Angulo, I., Orduna, P., Irurzun, J., Remote Laboratories Based on LXI (2008) International Journal of Online Engineering, 4 (3), pp. 25-27. , https://online-journals.org/index.php/i-joe, August International Journal of Online and Biomedical Engineering [Accessed Feb. 13, 2019]; Albu, M., Holbert, K., Heydt, G., Grigorescu, S., Trusca, V., Embedding Remote Experimentation in Power Engineering Education (2004) IEEE Transactions on Power Systems, 19 (1), pp. 139-143. , Feb; Hercog, D., Gergic, B., Uran, S., Jezernik, K., A DSP-Based Remote Control Laboratory (2007) IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics, 54 (6), pp. 3057-3068. , Dec; Restivo, M., Mendes, J., Lopes, A., Silva, C., Chouzal, F., A Remote Laboratory in Engineering Measurement (2009) IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics, 56 (12), pp. 4836-4843. , Dec; Garcia-Zubia, J., Angulo, I., Irurzun, J., Orduna, P., Ruiz, J., Hernandez, U., Castro, M., San-Cristobal, E., Easily Integrable Platform for the Deployment of a Remote Laboratory for Microcontrollers International Journal of Online Engineering, 6 (3), pp. 26-31. , https://onlinejournals.org/index.php/i-joe, August 2010 International Journal of Online and Biomedical Engineering [Accessed Feb. 15, 2019]; Sousa, N., Alves, G.R., Gericota, M., An Integrated Reusable Remote Laboratory to Complement Electronics Teaching (2010) IEEE Transactions on Learning Technologies, 3 (3), pp. 265-271. , July-Sep; Gustavsson, I., Zackrisson, J., Nilsson, K., Garcia-Zubia, J., Hakansson, L., Claesson, I., Lagö, T., A Flexible Instructional Electronics Laboratory with Local and Remote Lab Workbenches in a Grid (2008) International Journal of Online Engineering, 4 (2), pp. 12-16. , https://onlinejournals.org/index.php/i-joe, May International Journal of Online and Biomedical Engineering [Accessed Feb. 17, 2019]; The University of Future at Home!, , http://l3-eoles.unilim.fr/?lang=en, L3-EOLES [Accessed Feb. 17 2019]; Electronic and Optic E-Learning for Embedded Systems, , http://www.eoles.eu/, EOLES TEMPUS Project, 2019 [Accessed: Feb. 16 2019]; Big Blue Button, , https://bigbluebutton.org/, [Accessed Feb 17 2019]; Moodle, , https://moodle.org/, [Accessed Feb 17 2019]; Brinson, J.R., Learning outcome achievement in non-Traditional (virtual and remote) versus traditional (hands-on) laboratories: A review of the empirical research Computers & Education, 87, pp. 218-237. , July 2015; Andrieu, G., Barataud, D., Gericota, M., L3-EOLES-Electronics and Optics for Embedded Systems course (2017) The E-Learning Excellence Awards 2017: An Anthology of Case Histories, pp. 22-35. , Dan Remenyi, Ed.

The flipped classes were conducted in blended format with the aid of Learning Management System (LMS) tools provided by Blackboard (Bb), including Bb Collaborate. The focus of the project is to investigate the impact and effect of flipped classes on the performance of engineering students in an intermediate physics course (Physics 2). Students' performance was compared to other classes, which were taught using a traditional teaching approach. The midterm and final exam results were higher for the group of students who were taught using the flipped classes approach by 2.4, 4.18 and 4.85 points in all three summative assessment tools: Term Test 1, Term Test 2 and the Final Exam respectively, with p values of < 0.001. Flipping classes allowed students to learn at their own pace, which was facilitated by the IT and LMS tools that allowed students to pause, rewind, and review lectures, as well as increase the amount of individualized learning. The conclusion of the case study strongly supports blended learning as a teaching methodology, which promotes interactive classroom activities. © 2019 IEEE.","Flipped Physics Classes; Innovative Teaching Approach; Learning Management Systems; Physics 2; Students Performance","Engineering; Industrial engineering; Flipped Physics Classes; Individualized learning; Innovative teaching; Interactive classroom activity; Learning management system; Summative assessments; Teaching approaches; Teaching methodologies; Students","Tucker, B., The flipped classroom (2012) Educ Next, 12 (1), pp. 82-83; Sherbino, J., Chan, T., Schiff, K., The reverse classroom: Lectures on your own and homework with faculty (2013) CJEM, 15 (3), pp. 178-180; McLaughlin, J.E., Roth, M.T., Glatt, D.M., The flipped classroom: A course redesign to foster learning and engagement in a health professions school (2014) Acad Med, 89 (2), pp. 236-243; Bogdan, R.C., Biklen, S.K., (2003) Qualitative Research for Education: An Introduction to Theories and Methods, , 4th edn.

Thinking is the ability to challenge and eventually develop acquired knowledge to a higher attainment level.The proposed framework models here are intended for developing, stimulating, and engaging students' complex thinking process skills. This is a higher-order thinking level and consists of four subthinking skills, i.e., problem-solving, critical thinking, creative thinking, and decision-making. Common and supporting thinking skills of these four levels are identified and derived from the literature, and additional sublearning skills are defined as general capacities to perform a set of tasks and further development of students' higher-order thinking abilities. Furthermore, questions for focusing thinking or learning activities are developed to transform learned knowledge and skills into practical activities. Hence, course assignments (e.g., homework and quizzes) and learning tools (e.g., mind map, flowchart) were developed to engage students in developing their skills in these four thinking levels. Learning assignments and tasks, as related to complex thinking and related subthinking skills, can be mapped to students' learning outcomes, assessed, and eventually allow evaluating learning skills. Proposed teaching activities' initial assessments show high improvement in student learning and were applied successfully in higher education and partially tested first-grade students. Furthermore, it is implemented using a blended learning approach through providing skills-based assignments (e.g., homework, quizzes), interactive lectures, and using learning tools such as mind maps. Initial assessment of students' outcomes showed an improvement by 20% as compared with course sections with typical course delivery mode. © 2019 IEEE.","Creative Thinking; Critical Thinking; Decision-Making; Higher-Order Thinking; Learning Skills; Problem-Solving","Curricula; Decision making; Education computing; Schematic diagrams; Students; Creative thinking; Critical thinking; Higher order thinking skills; Higher-order thinkings; Interactive lecture; Learning skills; Multiple dimensions; Teaching activities; Problem solving","Boyatzis, R.E., Kolb, D.A., From learning styles to learning skills: The executive skills profile (1995) Journal of Managerial Psychology, 10 (5), pp. 3-17; Alex, F., Osborn, (1942) How to Think Up, , McGraw-Hill; Sidney, J., Parnes, (1992) Visionizing: State-of-The-Art Processes for Encouraging Innovative Excellence, , Creative Education Foundation Press; Treffinger, D.J., (1996) Dimensions of Creativity, Idea Capsule # 9004, , Sarasota, FL: Center for Creative Learning; Cohen, J., (1971) Thinking, , Rand McNally; Presseisen, B.Z., Thinking skills: Meanings and models revisited (2001) Developing Minds: A Resource Book for Teaching Thinking, pp. 47-57. , A.

The purpose of this paper is to develop an adaptive e-learning platform that enhances skills from primary school to university learners. Two purposes converge here: a pedagogical one – offering new possibilities, especially in terms of teaching scenarios (blended learning); and a research one – confirming the effectiveness of an adaptive e-learning tool in the case of individualized cross-disciplinary competences, such as comprehension of implicit information in written texts (French). Design/methodology/approach: The case study presented here concerns primary-school learners using the Implicit module of TACIT adaptive e-learning tool over the 2016-2017 academic year. Findings: This paper gives a first positive answer to the effectiveness of such a tool in this specific context. This pedagogical effectiveness is more pronounced for low-level pupils, especially for girls and for older pupils (CM1/CM2, respectively, fourth/fifth grade). Originality/value: In this case study, the module comes from an existing platform, created by the TACIT research group. The adaptive environment was created by using the Item Response Theory models and, more precisely, the Rasch model. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Adaptive environment; Blended learning; E-Learning Tools; Item response theory; Rasch model; Reading comprehension",,"Bangert, R., Kulik, J., Kulik, C., Individualized systems of instruction in secondary schools (1983) Review of Educational Research Summer, 53 (2), pp. 143-158; Benoit, K., (2011) Linear Regression Models with Logarithmic Transformations, , London School of Economics, London; Bianco, M., Megherbi, H., Sénéchal, M., Colé, P., Reading comprehension development: presentation of a special issue (2014) L’Année Psychologique, 114 (4), pp. 613-621; Black, P., Harrison, C., Lee, C., Marshall, B., William, D., (2003) Assessment for Learning: Putting It into Practice, , Open University Press, Buckingham; Bloom, B., The 2 sigma problem: the search for methods of group instruction as effective as one-to-one tutoring (1984) Educational Researcher, 13 (6), pp. 4-16; Cain, K., Oakhill, J., Inference making ability and its relation to comprehension failure in young children (1999) Reading and Writing, 11 (5-6), pp. 489-503; (2016) Note d’actualité, , www.cnesco.fr/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/161206_Note_PISA.pdf, (accessed: 2 May 2018; Cohen, J., A power primer (1992) Psychological Bulletin, 112 (1), pp. 155-159; Colmant, M., Le Cam, M., (2016) PIRLS 2016 etude internationale des CM1 en compréhension de l’Ecrit – evolution des performances sur quinze ans, , Note d’information n°17.24, décembre 2017; Coomey, M., Stephenson, J., Online learning: it is all about dialogue, involvement, support and control – according to the research (2001) Teaching and Learning Online: pedagogies for New Technologies, , Stephenson, J.

From the beginning of Universities' history, lectures are usually chosen to reach this goal but it is seen in recent years that they are in many cases not the optimal choice. In the last years, many efforts were made to increase students knowledge gain. From learning and motivation psychology research, many details are known how humans remember and transfer knowledge. These research results are used to create new lecture formats to activate students. Research based learning, project based lab courses, problem based learning, feedback systems, flipped classroom, blended learning and gamification in lectures are only some examples for new formats. Common goal of all these new types of learning formats is to increasing students' motivation and to enhance learning success.In this paper, evaluations using a questionnaire with open questions were done among first year students, bachelor students before graduation and alumni, about their sources of motivation and demotivation. Interesting curricula and lectures with application related topics and possibilities for own work are the main sources of motivation. Enthusiastic professors with high competences and good lecture didactics also contribute to students' motivation. On the other side, demotivated professors with boring lectures play a much higher role for demotivating students. Therefore, it is necessary to integrate aspects of student motivation into curriculum and lecture design and professors should become aware that they are important role-models for motivating or demotivating students. © 2018 IEEE.",,"Curricula; Education computing; Motivation; Bachelor students; Blended learning; Feedback systems; First year students; Problem based learning; Research results; Student motivation; Work in progress; Students","Abdool, A., DataRPG: Improving student motivation in data science through gaming elements (2017) Frontiers in Education Conference.

The three groups are students who studied the lesson and fully understand the contents, students who studied the lesson but do not fully understand the contents, and students who did not study the lesson and so do not understand the contents. The face-to-face learning in class is done separately for each group. We called this a 'grouped flipped classroom.' We applied the above grouped flipped classroom method to 16 weeks of actual lessons in the autumn semester of 2017 at our university. The results revealed that the grouped flipped classroom improved students' performance. In particular, for the group of students who had low understanding during self-study, there was a statistically significant difference between their average scores in the tests after the self-study and after the face-to-face lesson. In addition, the average score in the test after the face-to-face lesson was higher for students in the grouped flipped classroom than for students in conventional style classes (lecture style class and mixed ability class). © 2018 IEEE.","Blended-Learning; e-Learning; Effective Classroom; Flipped-Classroom","E-learning; Blended learning; Classroom method; Effective Classroom; Face to face; Face-to-face learning; Flipped-Classroom; Lecture style; Statistically significant difference; Students","Bergmann, J., Sams, A., (2012) Flip Your Classroom: Reach Every Student in Every Class Every Day, , International Society for Technology in Education, Washington, DC; Sams, A., Bergmann, J., Flip your students' learning (2013) Educational Leadership, 70 (6), pp. 16-20; Umezawa, K., Aramoto, M., Kobayashi, M., Ishida, T., Nakazawa, M., Hirasawa, S., An effective flipped classroom based on the log information of the self-study (2015) Proc. of the 3rd Int.

Course design for the (re)imagined course was based on 1) current literature related to TPACK, ISTE Standards and current issues in classroom technology integration and 2) a design framework including ADDIE principles and blended learning. The study was conducted during Spring 2018 in a face-to-face (F2) version of the ITT course at a Southwestern university in the US. Evaluation and feedback were collected from twenty-two students who completed the course. In addition to providing study findings, the article concludes with recommendations for the next course iteration and faculty members interested in (re)imagining learning technology courses. © 2018, Association for Educational Communications & Technology.","ADDIE; Blended learning; Educational technology; Learning design; Preservice teachers; TPACK",,"Baran, E., Chuang, H.H., Thompson, A., TPACK: An emerging research and development tool for teacher educators (2011) Turkish Online Journal of Educational Technology-TOJET, 10 (4), pp. 370-377; Brenner, A.M., Brill, J.M., Investigating practices in teacher education that promote and inhibit technology integration transfer in early career teachers (2016) TechTrends, 60 (2), pp. 136-144; Chai, C.S., Koh, J.H.L., Tsai, C.-C., Facilitating preservice teachers' development of technological, pedagogical and content knowledge (TPACK) (2010) Educational Technology & Society, 13 (4), pp. 63-73; Deterding, S., Dixon, D., Khaled, R., Nacke, L., From game design elements to gamefulness: Defining gamification (2011) In Proceedings of the 15Th International Academic Mindtrek Conference: Envisioning Future Media Environments, pp. 9-15. , ACM; Foulger, T.S., Graziano, K.J., Schmidt-Crawford, D., Slykhuis, D.A., Teacher educator technology competencies (2017) Journal of Technology and Teacher Education, 25 (4), pp. 413-448; Freire, P., (2009) Teachers as Cultural Workers: Letters to Those Who Dare Teach with New Commentary, , Peter McLaren, Joe L.

Technology leverages total-factor productivity and contributes to the growth of welfare. The lack of adequate financial and human capital hampers the adoption of technology in many parts of Africa. On September 2015, the General Assembly of United Nations adopted as a consensus resolution the 2030 Development Agenda for Sustainable Development with seventeen goals (SDGs). Creating a knowledge-based economy is a key enabling factor for achieving the SDGs. If successful, this will result in a reduction of inequalities and enhance the quality of life in those countries. It is our belief that education plays a key role in effective and sustainable development. While there are many ways for doing this, we believe that strengthening budding academic institutions is a sustainable long-Term strategy. Such approach needs to take the local situation into account and requires flexible frameworks with the ability to respond to local needs. We have embarked in an international effort to implement a solid proof-of-concept of our approach. Specifically, it focuses on two SDGs, 'good health and well-being' together with 'quality education'. If successful, we expect a positive impact on a third goal, 'decent work and economic growth'. The Canary Islands are a Spanish region and a European outermost region near West Africa. Thanks to the unique combination of geolocation and level of development, the islands play an increasing role as a logistics, trade hub, and launch base for many countries in Western Africa. Many aid organizations, including UN World Food Program, Red Cross/Crescent and USAid, use the Canary Islands as logistics base. In this paper, we report our current experience within the European funded INTERREG MACBioIDi project. One of our main aims is to create a learning community in the fields of medicine and engineering. The participants live in different countries. They speak different languages and come from a variety of cultures with different social and economic boundary conditions. African participants in the project come from Cape Verde, Mauritania, Senegal, and Mozambique. Technology partners come from the outermost European regions of Canary Islands, Azores and Madeira. The main technological platform used in this project is called 3D Slicer. 3D Slicer is an extensible, free software for visualization and processing of biomedical images and was created by a community of scientists and engineers led by researchers from Harvard. Training and mentoring is provided to African physicians, biomedical engineers and researchers in the use 3DSlicer. In order to support these activities, a training center has been created at the University of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria (ULPGC). We first describe the overall strategy of 3D Slicer training, designed in response to the needs of each African country. We highlight the major hurdles faced (e.g. internet connectivity, maintenance of medical equipment, differences in linguistic and social context). Then we focus on the implementation of the training program. Training sessions were held in Africa and at ULPGC, and based on a blended learning program with 'face to face' lessons, coaching, collaboration, multimedia, web based learning and support resources. Finally, we analyze the first results obtained in the program training and the measures adopted to readjust the action plan in the coming months. © 2018 IEEE.","3D Slicer; Africa; INTERREG MACBioIDi project","Biomedical engineering;

Even less common are evaluations that report the sociocultural context of the implementation. Recently, an Australian university in the western region of Victoria embarked on an initiative to blend all course units over a three-year period. Stemming from a rigorous analysis of reporting documents and participant-researcher observations, an attempt has been made to describe the sociocultural context of this blended learning initiative through the lens of Engestrom's Cultural-historical Activity Theory (CHAT). This description, along with the challenges surfaced will serve as a precursor to the university-wide impact evaluation of this blended learning initiative. The objective of the analysis was to reify the complex processes, intricate relationships and dynamic environmental elements, which tend not to be captured by impact evaluations. Understanding what exactly is going on will enable the University to situate evaluation findings in the context of factors that might have helped or hampered the achievement of outcomes, and remediate process-related problems in a timely manner. Amidst the flurry of focused and coordinated blended learning activities, eight key process-related challenges emerged: Staff Capacity, Engagement, Deployment, Workload, Technological Issues, Project Management, Communication and Unit Stability. These challenges could potentially make or break 'the Blend' if not adequately addressed. This paper highlights the value of process evaluations for online and blended learning implementations and argues for such evaluations to be grounded in ontological realities reflected on accountability reports and observational data. © ASCILITE 2017 - Conference Proceedings - 34th International Conference of Innovation, Practice and Research in the Use of Educational Technologies in Tertiary Education.All right reserved.",,"Educational technology; Human resource management; Project management; Complex Processes; Cultural historical activity theories (CHAT); Cultural-historical; Impact evaluation; Observational data; Process Evaluation; Rigorous analysis; Sociocultural context; Activity coefficients","Allen, I.E., Seaman, J., Garrett, R., Blending in: The extent and promise of blended learning in the United States (2007) Sloan-C Report, , http://www.blendedteaching.org/system/files/Blending_In.pdf; Bentley, Y., Selassie, H., Parkin, E., Evaluation of a global blended learning MBA programme (2012) The International Journal of Management Education, 10 (2), pp. 75-87; Bligh, B., Flood, M., Activity theory in empirical higher education research: Choices, uses and values (2017) Tertiary Education and Management, 23 (2), pp. 125-152; Cuban, L., (2017) The Attribution Error and School Reform [Blog Post], , https://larrycuban.wordpress.com/2017/05/06/theattribution-error-and-school-reform/, May 25; Engestrom, Y., Activity theory as a framework for analyzing and redesigning work (2000) Ergonomics, 43 (7), pp. 960-974; Engeström, Y., Sannino, A., Studies of expansive learning: Foundations, findings and future challenges (2010) Educational Research Review, 5 (1), pp. 1-24; Garrison, D.R., Kanuka, H., Blended learning: Uncovering its transformative potential in higher education (2004) The Internet and Higher Education, 7 (2), pp. 95-105; Garrison, D.R., Vaughan, N.D., (2008) Blended Learning in Higher Education: Framework, Principles, and Guidelines, , John Wiley & Sons; Hardman, J., Amory, A., Introduction to cultural-historical activity theory and tool mediation (2015) Activity Theory, Authentic Learning and Emerging Technologies: Towards a Transformative Higher Education Pedagogy, pp. 9-21; Partridge, H., Ponting, D., McCay, M., Good practice report: Blended learning (2011) Australian Learning and Teaching Council, , http://eprints.qut.edu.au/47566; Roth, W.M., Lee, Y.J., Vygotsky's neglected legacy”: Cultural-historical activity theory (2007) Review of Educational Research, 77 (2), pp. 186-232; Torrisi-Steele, G., This thing called blended learning - A definition and planning approach (2011) Research and Development in Higher Education:Reshaping Higher Education, Gold Coast, 34, pp. 360-371. , K.

A recent review of blended learning studies reveals that colleges and universities do not readily keep records of who teaches blended courses, and faculty are not fully cognizant of whether they are teaching in blended learning format (Skrypnyk et al, 2015). Driven by needs such as improved course delivery and student retention, tertiary institutions are strategically increasing their blended learning offerings, yet there exists no widely accepted reporting mechanism to monitor blended learning adoption. This paper introduces a practical method for monitoring blended learning adoption at an institution, and recommends an approach towards semi-automating the process. © ASCILITE 2015 - Australasian Society for Computers in Learning and Tertiary Education, Conference Proceedings.All right reserved.","Blended learning adoption; Evaluation; Monitoring","Distance education; Monitoring; Blended learning; Colleges and universities; Evaluation; Online and distance education; Practical method; Reporting mechanisms; Student retention; Tertiary institutions; Teaching","Alammary, A., Sheard, J., Carbone, A., Blended learning in higher education: Three different design approaches (2014) Australasian Journal of Educational Technology, 30 (4), pp. 440-454; Allen, I.E., Seaman, J., Garrett, R., (2007) Blending in: The Extent and Promise of Blended Education in the United States, , Newburyport, MA: Sloan Consortium; Bonk, C.J., Graham, C.R., (2005) Handbook of Blended Learning: Global Perspectives, Local Designs, , Eds San Francisco, CA: Pfeiffer Publishing; Garrison, D.R., Kanuka, H., Blended learning: Uncovering its transformative potential in higher education (2004) The Internet and Higher Education, 7 (2), pp. 95-105; Graham, C.R., Henrie, C.R., Gibbons, A.S., Developing models and theory for blended learning research (2014) Blended Learning: Research Perspectives, 2, pp. 13-33. , A.G.

The research was aimed at introducing a better and a qualitative teaching and learning approach which can accommodate the overpopulated classes in African institutions. A mixed research method was implemented in gathering and analyzing the data obtained from the study. A mixed learning experiment was conducted with some students from an African higher institution. One hundred and twenty-five students taking a JAVA programming course participated in the experiment. Focus team, semi-structured interview, and questionnaires were employed during the experiment. The findings argue that the new learning approach (blended learning) may motivate and enhance the students’ learning efficiency. In conclusion, a framework or a guideline has been suggested for the possible implementation of blended learning in African higher education institutions amidst their limited resources, and educational institutions in developing countries at large. © J.UCS.","African institutions; Approach to learning; Blended learning; Face-to-face learning; Students’ perception",,"Adeyeye, M.O., Musa, A.G., Botha, A., Problem with multi-video format m-learning applications E-Learning, 2, pp. 294-330. , Adeyeye, 13, J.-E.

It describes successful mobile blended learning, which is based on the combination of traditional, face-to-face classes and the use of mobile app, which was exploited as support for the retention and practice of new English words and phrases at the Faculty of Informatics and Management of the University of Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic. The purpose of this article is to evaluate the effectiveness of the use of mobile app on students’ learning achievement in the university Course of Practical English Language. The methodology is based on an experiment and statistical analysis of students’ achievement results. The findings of this study confirm that the use of mobile app is effective in learning new words and phrases, which is in line with other studies on this topic. In fact, the use of app in informal settings extends and enriches student’s learning environment and enhances student’s learning potential. Future research should continue in order to obtain more subject samples. It will be also important to see if the success rate of students who use the mobile app while studying changes or remains the same over time. In addition, the authors might research students’ motivation and attitude towards the use of mobile app. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","Effectiveness; English learning; Mobile app; Mobile blended learning; Vocabulary learning","Computer aided instruction; Students; Blended learning; Effectiveness; English Learning; Mobile app; Vocabulary learning; E-learning","Smith, A., Record shares of Americans now own smartphones (2017) Have Home Broadband, , http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/01/12/evolution-of-technology/; Pachler, N., Bachmair, B., Cook, J., (2010) Mobile Learning: Structure, Agency, Practices, , https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4419-0585-7, 1st edn.

The global world can be described by two aspects, i.e., interculturality (meeting cultures through the Internet and in reality) and electronic transfer of data and information. Both these phenomena present a challenge and opportunity for blended learning. The paper describes a case study on how blended learning course of intercultural business communication was introduced at the University of Hradec Kralove. It presents the results of students’ satisfaction with the new method of teaching and learning. The students showed their satisfaction with blended learning methodology implemented in the course, however, the paper also highlights possible threats for the learning process, such as data fatigue caused by too much screen time. The respondents expressed their satisfaction with the variety of learning methods but they themselves highlighted the fact that they spend a lot of time in front of the screen and using mobile devices, even if better learning results were intended, is not necessarily beneficial for the participants of the learning process. This paper is trying to stress the urge for the balance in blended learning because the vast majority of scholars neglect this aspect which can potentially bring problems. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2019.","Blended learning; Communication; e-Learning; Hybrid learning; Intercultural communication; Interculturality; Linguistic aspects of blended learning","Communication; Data transfer; Learning systems; Students; Teaching; Blended learning; Business communications; Electronic communications; Electronic transfers; Hybrid learning; Inter-cultural communications; Interculturality; Teaching and learning; E-learning","Ashmarina, S., Kandrashina, E., Zotova, A., (2017) Global Educational Trends in Intellectual Capital Development, 39. , Innovative Economic Symposium, (IES2017): Strategic Partnership in International Trade.

The programming courses are taught by applying a traditional learning method in which the programming concepts are explained theoretically and minimal practical work is applied. In addition, students receive either no formative feedback or minimal manual delayed feedback after submitting their practical work. This negatively affects students' performance as students find it difficult to understand the programming concepts. This paper addresses the aforementioned drawbacks by applying blended learning for the first time to the C programming course which is taught to more than 1000 students each year at An-Najah National University, Palestine. Blended learning is a hybrid learning method which integrates the traditional learning method with technology and online learning. It provides students with more practical work and automated immediate formative feedback. This paper aims to study the effect of blended learning on students' performance, and students' satisfaction with the blended learning method. An independent experimental design was applied on 1374 undergraduate students enrolled in C programming course. Students were divided into two groups based on the learning method. The first group consisted of 632 students who studied the course using the traditional learning method, while the second group consisted of 742 students in which blended learning was applied. Quantitative and qualitative research methods were applied and the results revealed that blended learning improved student performance significantly compared with traditional learning. In addition, the results revealed that students were satisfied with the blended learning method in terms of easiness to use and suitability for programming and submitting assignments. © 2013 IEEE.","Automatic evaluation; blended learning; e-learning; formative feedback; performance; traditional learning method; Virtual Programming Lab (VPL)","C (programming language); Curricula; E-learning; Students; Automatic evaluation; Blended learning; Formative feedbacks; performance; Traditional learning; Virtual programming; Learning systems","Holsapple, C.W., Lee-Post, A., Defining, assessing, and promoting e-learning success: An information systems perspective (2006) Decis.

However, blended learning exists on a continuum between 100% face-to-face and 100% online for training, student participation, and course delivering/accessing. Establishing the percent of blend is compulsory. The performance of blended learning classroom can be improved not only by technology mediation, but also developing well suited educational resources to be integrated during learning tasks. ADDIE/SAMR methodology deals with the development strategy of blended learning-oriented courses according to the life-cycle steps (Analysis, Design, Development, Implementation and Evaluation) taking into account SAMR transformation model by the following operations: Substitution, Augmentation, Modification, and Redefinition. The methodology was used to develop a computational intelligence course for a master program in modern technologies in information system engineering. The learning environment is supported by Blackboard platform, where communication is mediated by e-mail, and forum. The perceptions and satisfaction of students enrolled on platform to participate in the blended manner to the course were registered and analysed. The following data were collected: Educational resources format; Educational resources usability; Educational resources clarity; Educational resources accessibility; Calendar of meetings in class; Interaction maturity in class/online; Teams development; The adequacy level of assignments; Comparison of work in class / assignments; Preference for traditional courses. Computer-based assessment practices proved value in increasing the student participation and motivation and to provide feedback to students in a timely manner to help them to identify weaknesses, reflect on their strong behaviour, and improve their learning strategy. Results are presented through a comparison against traditional version of the course. Moreover, details on student performance, tutor rating, student self evaluation are obtained and discussed. © 2019, National Defence University - Carol I Printing House.

Learning Tahsin is usually done by face-to-face involving learners and instructors, as also held as extracurricular in STT Nurul Fikri, a higher education institution focusing on IT education and character building. However, several problems occur regarding schedules, many other activities, curriculum, less organized, and low enthusiasm. Thus, the level of participation and time efficiency in learning Tahsin process is low and required improvement. Meanwhile, social media has the potential to tackle this issue through blended learning, bringing the different learning experience to ease the learning process. Naturally, the application of a new learning system is not immediately successful. The continuous evaluation is needed. This background problem motivates this study to conduct a quasi-experimental in applying blended learning to the learning Tahsin. The objective is to produce an optimal learning system consists of a fitted curriculum and learning materials, increased level of participation, time efficiency, and an established supporting organization for the learning process. The research steps include a preliminary study, data collection, learning system design, and several evaluation iterations. As a result, this study produces a blended learning system strategy for learning Tahsin using social media, with several issues to be concerned. They are learning the curriculum and material design, strategy to maintain participants commitments through providing rewards mechanism, and encouraging collaboration in the process, such as reading the Qur'an together. The evaluations show positive results with excellent predicate intervals. © 2019 The Authors.","Al qur'an; Blended learning; Social media; Tahsin","Curricula; Efficiency; Information systems; Information use; Social networking (online); Students; Blended learning; Higher education institutions; Learning experiences; Learning materials; Social media; System strategies; Tahsin; Time efficiencies; Learning systems","Rauf, A.A.A., (2014) Pedoman Dauroh Al-Qur'An [Quran Daurah Guideline], , Jakarta, Markaz Al Qur'an; (2018) STT Terpadu Nurul Fikri, , http://www.nurulfikri.ac.id/index.php/zh/artikel/item/1365-telah-di-buka-penerimaanmahasiswa-baru-stt-nf-2017-2018; Alhamuddin, F.F.R.S.H., Tandika, D., Adwiyah, R., Developing Al-Quran instruction model through 3A (Ajari aku al - Quran or please teach me al-quran) to improve students' ability in reading al-Quran at Bandung Islamic University (2018) International Journal of Education, 10 (2), pp. 95-100; Moore, J.L., Dickson-Deane, C., Galyen, K., E-learning, online learning, and distance learning environments: Are they the same?

In order to do this, we are here presenting a didactic proposal using Project Based Learning (PBL) as a methodological approach, which is framed in the subject of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) in the field of education. A quantitative methodology has been carried out using the technique of the questionnaire for data collection. For the assessment, the Questionnaire of Effectiveness of the use of methodologies for Active Participation (CEMPA) has been used. This has been divided into 4 dimensions: Specific Skills, General Skills, Systemic and Interpersonal Skills (Carrasco, Donoso, Duarte-Atoche, Hernandez & Lopez, 2015). The outcomes are highly positive. These results are supported by other results obtained in former investigations which underwent similar research. Likewise, it is shown that the use of this methodology facilitates the acquisition of digital competence, as well as the development of different skills that are addressed with the use of this type of methodology. In conclusion, it can be established that the PBL has helped students of the Blended Learning mode to obtain a significant learning both, in the Specific skills as in the General and Systemic ones. On the contrary, no significant learning in Interpersonal skills has been obtained. This may be due to the fact that students under the Blended Learning mode have little interaction with the rest of their peers since it takes place mainly through digital channels. © Copyright 2019 IADIS Press All rights reserved.","Blended Learning; Digital Competence; Information and Communication Technologies (ICTS); Project-Based Learning (PBL)","Learning systems; Students; Surveys; Blended learning; Digital Competence; Early childhood educations; Information and Communication Technologies; Innovative methodologies; Methodological approach; Project based learning; Quantitative methodology; E-learning","Area, M., ICT pedagogical innovation and development of information and digital competencies (2008) Journal of Research in School, 64, pp. 5-17; Bustos, H.G., Gómez, M.G., Digital competence in teaching high school as a means of Innovation Educative (2018) Journal of Educational Research, 26, pp. 66-86; Cabero, J., Román, P., (2006) E-activities: A Basic Reference for Internet Training., , https://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/libro?codigo=10840, Editorial MAD; Cabero, J., Reflexiones educativas sobre las tecnologías de la Información y la Comunicación (TIC) (2015) Technology, Science and Education.

The following pedagogical approaches and techniques of blended learning are discussed: combination of face-to-face and distance learning, group members’ partnership, development of group work skills, heterogeneous grouping, combined use of individual and peer assessment, teacher’s monitoring of the students’ work, task-oriented approach, chance for every member to be a leader, essential feedback. The authors suggest using private and public cloud technologies in an integrated academic cloud to support the implementation of group methodology in the teaching process. The analyzed academic cloud includes Apache CloudStack and EVE-NG Community platforms. This cloud environment was deployed at Physics and Mathematics Department of Volodymyr Hnatiuk National Pedagogical University of Ternopil (Ukraine). The developed methodology is used in course ""Computer Networks"". It has been verified experimentally by using appropriate statistical methods. © 2019 CEUR-WS.

Ecodesign should not be limited university-level core courses and potential problems that might appear in using the ecological design methods and tools. To achieve maximum efficiency in ecodesign instruction, it is necessary to create a framework that allows the mixing of traditional face-to-face and online education methods, ie, blended learning (b-learning). The purpose of this research is to investigate pros and cons of blended learning over face-to-face classroom teaching or online learning from the students’ perspective. The present study was conducted for a target group of Master students which studied Ecodesign for a semester. The paper is structured into two fundamental parts: Part1 describes teaching and learning methods (TLM) in higher education (HE); Part 2 examines the best practices instructional strategies for use of b-learning (setting the stages, ensuring responsibility for online activities, use of a highly structured, active learning format, short reviews of online material during class, collection and use of student feedback on quality and standards of learning etc.). The asynchronous or synchronous learning or a combination of the two are only possible if the professor offers innovative learning methods in the field of ecodesign. Ecodesign course based on b-learning was designed to provide opportunity for integrating the learning management system "" Moodle” with face-to-face interaction. In order to test the effectiveness of a b-learning method for teaching and learning ecodesign, at the end of the teaching period, each student was asked to fill out a survey with questions on the benefits and limitations of this method for learning. The present survey revealed that blended learning is more favorable than e-learning and provides many benefits for students like interactive educational experience, flexibility of connecting to more information and accessing them at any time, optimizing learning time and individualization of learning. Based on the case studies presented here, the students were encouraged to develop their own practical projects, which will motivate other students. Future research will be focused on the enhancement of the b-learning method in the classroom through workshops, problem-solving sessions, multiple case studies, demonstration projects and more surveys (paper or online). © 2019, National Defence University - Carol I Printing House.

It aimed to explore students' attitudes towards the use of a 'closed' class Facebook group in the English language classroom and to describe how they utilize it as part of their English language learning. Research participants were sophomore students enrolled at an English writing class in the first semester of the academic year 2016 - 2017. Research data come from surveys, students' wall posts, students' reflections, and individual and focus group interviews suggest that despite some technological limitations, students view and respond positively to the use of Facebook as an alternative platform for English language learning and as an innovative and strategic tool in enhancing lesson delivery, engaging students with the material, and creating a discourse space for self-expression. Pedagogical implications for ESL (English as a second language) and EFL (English as a foreign language) and researchers are offered in the light of these results.

The theoretical background is thus represented by some of the current global learning trends, such as personal learning environments, gamification or social learning, with relevant references to the area of foreign language teaching methodology, namely to the issues of task-based learning. From this perspective, blended approach is used as a conceptual framework for designing the particular integrated learning tasks, directed towards the development of students´ self-presentation skills in an online environment as well as in the classroom setting. Moreover, the task design options are considered in terms of their primary focus either on the area of general English or the field of ESP. The empirical part presents the results of our small-scale research, which was carried out in two specific areas of ESP, namely English for transport and English for health studies. The selected case study design draws on the potential of mixed methods approaches in social research. The quantitative data were collected via a structured questionnaire and analysed using the relevant statistical methods (chi-square, t-test, and correlational statistics). The qualitative part was focused on identifying the emerging categories through the content analysis of the students´ authentic language production within the particular integrated blended assignment. The research outcomes offer a complex evaluation of three different blended task formats with various degrees of involvement of their “online” components in the LMS Moodle. Besides, each of the aforementioned blended assignments included the task of an oral classroom presentation as its “offline” component. The analysis also focuses on the students´ perceptions of “onstage” aspects of those blended assignments which contained an online forum component. Our findings imply that performing an integrated blended assignment provides a very effective validation of the data previously collected in the category of the students´ proclaimed preferences of the particular educational content (ESP vs general English). © The Authors, 2019.

Background Online and blended learning modes continue to grow in popularity in higher education, with the aim of streamlining and enhancing student learning, supporting collaboration and creativity, and equipping students with the skills they will require to work and live in an increasingly digitized world. This practice-based case study highlights factors which positively and negatively affect user engagement with digital learning objects and ex-plores students' perceptions of the role of online learning within their aca-demic programs. Methodology A suite of nine interactive e-tutorials, addressing essential digital literacy skills for university students, was developed through instructor and student peer collaboration using Articulate software, informed by best practice. The e-tutorials were embedded in the institutional Learning Management System for three undergraduate and postgraduate courses, in which digital literacy formed the core learning content, to complement classroom-based learning. Students in these courses were surveyed via SurveyMonkey about their specific experience of using the e-tutorials, as well as their general perceptions of digital literacy and online learning. Eighty-six students in total completed the questionnaire, which consisted of twenty-three closed- and open-ended questions. Contribution Through highlighting both the positive and the challenging aspects of the students' reported experience of online learning, this case study contrib-utes useful insights to the body of literature on user engagement with digi-tal learning objects in higher education, as well as students' perceptions and experience of blended learning. Findings The e-tutorials were perceived as valuable in reinforcing classroom learn-ing, allowing respondents to revise concepts and materials covered in face-to-face classes, at their own pace and in their own time. Survey responses showed that the accessibility, ease-of-use, design and duration of the e-tutorials were deemed effective in terms of user engagement; however, several technological challenges were identified, such as browser incompat-ibility, uneven sound quality and general Internet connection issues, which disrupted their learning. Overall, students expressed enjoyment of the learning facilitated by the e-tutorials; however, rather than favoring online learning alone, they expressed a preference for a blended learning envi-ronment, with a combination of complementary learning approaches; sur-vey respondents did not generally wish to forego face-to-face classes en-tirely. Recommendations for Practitioners Instructors should seek to strategically embed interactive digital learning objects in their courses at defined points of need in a logical structure, e.g., to reinforce classroom-based learning, or to support specific skill develop-ment. Potential disruption to learning should be minimized by following best practice guidelines to ensure ease of access, a seamless user experi-ence, and timely feedback, as well as providing adequate support for rapid resolution of technical glitches. Recommendations for Researchers E-tutorials offer a useful means of exploring ways in which students ac-quire learning in the digital environment. A wider, collaborative exploration is needed to provide comparative studies which move beyond case studies. Impact on Society Online learning mechanisms, such as e-tutorials, offer students different means of acquiring essential literacy skills and different ways to interact with content. E-tutorials constitute reusable learning objects, which can be accessed as just-in-time delivery modes, when students perceive they need to review particular skills or reinforce learning material. Future Research This research is now expanding into different types of reusable learning objects. E-tutorials may be developed in multiple ways, and comparative research around e-tutorial models will deepen our understanding of how students interact with content in formal learning contexts. As the digital educational landscape continues to expand alongside traditional face-to-face and analogue learning modes, a key research focus will be student and instructor perceptions and experience of blended learning in different con-texts. © 2019, Journal of Information Technology Education: Innovations in Practice.","Blended learning; Digital literacy; E-learning; E-tutorials; Higher education; Online learning; Online tutorials","Curricula; E-learning; Education computing; Human computer interaction; Sound reproduction; Surveys; Blended learning; Digital literacies; Higher education; Online learning; Online tutorials; Students","Ademole-Odeshi, E., Attitudes of students towards e-learning in South-West Nigerian universities: An application of technology acceptance model (2014) Library Philosophy and Practice (e-journal), 1035, pp. 1-18. , http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/libphilprac/1035; Ala-Mutka, K., Mapping digital competence: Towards a conceptual understanding (2011) JRC Technical Notes, JRC67075, , http://ftp.jrc.es/EURdoc/JRC67075_TN.pdf, Seville: Institute for Prospective Technological Studies; Barber, W., King, S., Teacher-student perspectives of invisible pedagogy: New directions in online problem-based learning environments (2016) The Electronic Journal of e-Learning, 14 (4), pp. 235-243. , www.ejel.org/issue/download.html?idArticle=509; Bawden, D., Information and digital literacies: A review of concepts (2001) Journal of Documentation, 57 (2), pp. 218-259. , https://doi.org/10.1108/EUM0000000007083; Bawden, D., Origins and concepts of digital literacy (2008) Digital litera-cies: Concepts, policies and practices, pp. 17-32. , http://pages.ucsd.edu/~bgoldfarb/comt109w10/reading/Lankshear-Knobel_et_al-DigitalLiteracies.pdf, In C.

Modern blended learning has evolved from an asynchronous design to involve a blend of technology enhanced synchronous activities. To address the identified problems with feelings of loneliness, confusion and low motivation blended learning must also be designed to support collaboration, rich teacher-student and student-student interaction. The aim of this study was to explore the relationship between collaborative learning, retention rates and learning outcomes in university courses given in blended synchronous mode. The important main research questions to answer were: “What is the relationship between student satisfaction, student interaction, learning outcomes and retention rates?, and: “What kind of variables could be used to describe how group work is being conducted? The overall research strategy was a case study approach with data collected from multiple sources. Teachers from 37 courses in two bachelor programmes answered an online survey to investigate the relations between student collaboration, student interaction, pass rates and students-overall impression of courses. Survey answers were analysed and compared to answers in course evaluations and results in national study documentation system. Findings indicate that there is a correlation between students’ overall impression of a course and the pass rate, where students’ overall impressions are based on the course evaluation. There is also a correlation between students’ interactions in a course and students’ overall impression of a course, where a high degree of student interactions results in a more positive overall impression. There were no correlations regarding student grades, and the various types of group work and the design differences between the two programmes require further analyses. © The Authors, 2019.

Experimental engineering skills and abilities can be developed by using remote labs and simulations. The development of critical thinking of engineer students takes place while students work with virtual resources, and students need to understand what kind of results they get for each experiment. Even if it addresses the same problems - by differentiating the simulation laboratories - it focuses on another field: not the ability to do this, but how you can do it. Online laboratories are also fundamental to the experiments the student performs in the individual study because they are specially designed for distance students who need to gain an introductory knowledge and familiarity with real-life phenomena. These on-line experiments can be carried out in various engineering fields, including Electrical and Computer Engineering. The instructional design model is based on the ADDIE model, which includes the phases of analysis, design, development, implementation, and evaluation. Virtual Learning Environments (VLEs) are used to make online interactions between Students and Teachers. Moodle (Modular Object-Oriented Dynamic Learning Environment) is known as an online course management system (CMS). Learning Process and Content Management Systems (LCMS), in this case, Moodle (an open source software platform for e- learning), provides instructors with the tools to create e-learning or Blended Learning course. The article provides resources and information to help educators, administrators, and decision-makers better apply ITC in engineering education programs. The resources were analyzed by the Faculty of Electrical Engineering (“Gh. Asachi” Technical University of Iasi, Romania) in collaboration with Menoufia University, Egypt with extensive experience in integrating ICT in the training programs of engineering teachers. © 2019, National Defence University - Carol I Printing House.

Its central focus is on epistemological and methodological issues and commitments – specifically whether stereotypical and established Western methodological approaches are suited for investigating African contexts. Considering various ideas about ‘indigenous knowledge’ and sensitivities, an eclectic approach is adopted and deployed. The resulting ‘method’ presented can be adopted by those interested in finding indigeneity in conventional forms of investigation, and those that wish to engage in having a rather eclectic standpoint in research. This perspective has important implications for those investigating ‘technology acceptance and adoption’ in Africa; the use and development of learning technologies and the idea of ‘blended learning’ and those considering ‘post-colonial’ computing.

While the design framework was grounded in evidence-based approaches that exemplify quality delivery, these course designs have had variable reactions from students in their implementation. As such, a student dimension to the evaluation of the framework was added and the findings from the initial pilot are reported here. It has been found that students may not be as ready for 21st century learning and teaching practices as current rhetoric implies.

Comparison allows for disclosing cultural practices and structures in other countries and in one’s own. It can grant access to previously unavailable or hidden knowledge, and it can shape new knowledge for theory and practice. In the field of adult education, where theory and practice often remain national, comparison allows for understanding, sharing, and creating theoretical frameworks, structures, and practices. To that end, the project Erasmus+ Strategic Partnership “Comparative Studies in Adult Education and Lifelong Learning—COMPALL” developed a joint module in study programmes related to adult education and lifelong learning. Through its innovative teaching and study programme, which is based on blended learning mobility, COMPALL became a forum for knowledge sharing and creation. Over 3 years, seven European universities designed innovative learning and teaching strategies that foster the exchange of knowledge, cultural understanding, and knowledge creation by conducting comparative research. The study programme consistently received a positive response from participants and produced three books presenting the results. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.",,,"Bray, M., The multifaceted field of comparative education: Evolution, themes, actors, and applications (2008) Comparative Adult Education, pp. 33-44. , J.

The Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) is a measure of teachers pedagogical, content and technical knowledge and their skill to embed technology in practice. Using the TPACK framework, this study explores the relationship between technical skills, learning design and how these relate to pedagogy. The study also investigates how TPACK varies by subject area, teaching qualification, and employment. A survey of 112 lecturers from a multi-campus university was conducted. We found that lecturers who have high TPACK tend to use more varied and interactive learning activities. TPACK did not significantly vary by subject area. It did not also vary between those who received a few trainings over the past year in comparison to those who didn’t. However, significant differences in TPACK were found in terms of nature of employment and teaching qualification in higher education. These findings suggest that there is a need to provide a varied approach to develop staff competencies. © 2019 K.

Engineering higher education is in need of modernization in order to link student skills to labour market needs. Skills necessary for supporting economic growth include both a sound theoretical background as well as transversal competencies such as problem-solving capacity, creativity, and analytical thinking. This work presents a problem-based learning framework that aims to more effectively develop students for transitioning into the world of work. This is pursued through active educational approaches supported by digital learning services that promote collaboration, innovative mindsets, autonomous, and self-relying work. The proposed platform facilitates learning experiences that integrate simulations and serious games linked to real world challenges in the context of wider, blended learning practices. The framework is being developed by a network of European and South Asian universities with the objective of integrating needs from diverse cultural, economic, and educational environments resulting into an educational platform with international relevance.

A first-year mathematics for engineering unit offered at a large, metropolitan Australian university provides the context for this research. As part of the project, the unit was redesigned using a framework that employed flexible, modular, connected e-learning and teaching experiences. The researchers, interested in an ecological perspective on educational processes, grounded the redesign principles in probabilistic learning design (Kirschner et al., 2004). The effectiveness of the redesigned environment was assessed through the lens of the notion of affordance (Gibson, 1977,1979, Greeno, 1994, Good, 2007). A qualitative analysis of the questionnaire distributed to students at the end of the teaching period provided insight into factors impacting on the successful creation of an environment that encourages complex, multidimensional and multilayered interactions conducive to learning. © ASCILITE 2015 - Australasian Society for Computers in Learning and Tertiary Education, Conference Proceedings.All right reserved.","Affordances; Blended learning; Ecology of learning; Probabilistic learning design","Probabilistic logics; Affordances; Blended learning; E-learning and teachings; Ecological approaches; Educational process; Probabilistic Learning; Qualitative analysis; Technology enhanced learning; Ecology","Abeysekera, L., Dawson, P., Motivation and cognitive load in the flipped classroom: Definition, rationale and a call for research (2015) Higher Education Research & Development, 34 (1), pp. 1-14; Biggs, J., Tang, C., (2007) Teaching for Quality Learning at University, , Third Edition.

MiC students attend placements at community organisations, General Practice clinics and face-to-face tutorials and lectures for two five-week blocks. Responding to students' lack of engagement and preference for more flexible delivery modes, a blended learning approach using the Community of Inquiry framework to guide the design has been gradually introduced since 2014. The MiC webpage was revised to simplify access to key information and resources. Five lectures were transformed into online modules and one workshop was converted into a flipped classroom. Multi-media open educational resources were added to replace some reading materials. Online “Weekly Study Guide” scaffolds, paces and aligns students' self-directed learning with MiC learning outcomes. Moving program evaluation and some assessments to an online platform enables more timely feedback. These developments have resulted in novel, engaging learning activities. Preliminary evaluation indicates students' greater engagement with the MiC program and deeper levels of learning indicated by increased levels of reflection and the demonstration of MiC learning outcomes being satisfied. © ASCILITE 2017 - Conference Proceedings - 34th International Conference of Innovation, Practice and Research in the Use of Educational Technologies in Tertiary Education.All right reserved.",,"Educational technology; Medical education; Medicine; Multimedia systems; Scaffolds; Community of inquiry; Flexible delivery; Learning Activity; Learning and teachings; Learning programs; Open educational resources; Program evaluation; Self-directed learning; Students","Akyol, Z., Garrison, D., Ozden, M., Online and blended communities of inquiry: Exploring the developmental and perceptional differences (2009) The International Review of Research in Open and Distributed Learning, 10 (6), pp. 65-83; Akyol, Z., Vaughan, N., Garrison, D.R., The impact of course duration on the development of a community of inquiry (2011) Interactive Learning Environments, 19 (3), pp. 231-246; DeNoyelles, A., Zydney, J., Chen, I., Strategies for creating a community of inquiry through online asynchronous discussions (2014) Journal of Online Learning and Teaching, 10 (1), p. 153. , n/a; Garrison, D.R., Anderson, T., Archer, W., Critical inquiry in a text-based environment: Computer conferencing in higher education (1999) The Internet and Higher Education, 2 (2-3), pp. 87-105. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1096-7516(00)00016-6; Garrison, D.R., Kanuka, H., Blended learning: Uncovering its transformative potential in higher education (2004) Internet and Higher Education, 7 (2), pp. 95-105; Lipman, M., (1991) Thinking in Education, , Cambridge University Press; Mahoney, S., Boileau, L., Floridis, J., Abi-Abdallah, C., Lee, B., How social accountability can be incorporated into an urban community-based medical education program: An Australian initiative (2014) Education for Health, 27 (2), pp. 148-151; McCarthy, L., Jones, A., Yeomans, N.D., Bambrick, H., Pacey, F., Ramanathan, J., Wills, T., Engaging for health: Medicine in context as a case study in engaged teaching and learning for students in medicine (2010) Australasian Journal of University Community Engagement, 5 (2), pp. 67-87; Mills, J., Yates, K., Harrison, H., Woods, C., Chamberlain-Salaun, J., Trueman, S., Hitchins, M., Using a community of inquiry framework to teach a nursing and midwifery research subject: An evaluative study (2016) Nurse Education Today, 43, pp. 34-39. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nedt.2016.04.016; Preston, R., Larkins, S., Taylor, J., Judd, J., Building blocks for social accountability: A conceptual framework to guide medical schools (2016) BMC Medical Education, 16 (1), p. 227; Thandi, C.S., Forrest, S., Williamson, C., The role of early inter-professional and inter-agency encounters in increasing students' awareness of the clinical and community context of medicine (2016) Perspectives on Medical Education, 5 (4), pp. 240-243; Vaughan, N.D., A blended community of inquiry approach: Linking student engagement and course redesign (2010) The Internet and Higher Education, 13 (1-2), pp. 60-65. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.iheduc.2009.10.007",,,,"English",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85072043990

A review of existing literature shows we can still raise no conclusion, and in particular when dealing with face to face (F2F) studies. In this article, we analyze the performance of a first-year engineering course, offered in a higher education institution (a public university). The course under analysis lasts for 12 weeks and is offered with flipped classroom methodology. Activities that students should follow out of class are scheduled in advance, and communicated to students during the learning period. In addition, there has been a previous effort to align learning activities and learning outcomes. The goal is to determine if prediction models fed with data gathered during the learning process can provide an accurate estimator of students at risk. This risk evaluation will be done considering as core data those reflecting activity, being of particular relevance, traces stored in LMS as part of the learning process. Our study demonstrates performance can be estimated based on this data, with increasing accuracy over time. Activity performed by the student is linked to academic result, and this relation is verified even when not taking into account any graded results obtained during the learning process.

In recent years, LMS have been adopted in some higher education institutions in sub-Saharan Africa including Tanzania, however, there are limited research in this area, which could hinder future developments. Therefore, this study investigates the adoption and usage of LMS as pedagogical tool among students and instructors at the State University of Zanzibar (SUZA). The methodology used in this study included the review of the literature, focus group discussions and semi-structured interviews. The study was conducted in Zanzibar from March 2016 to March 2017. A total of 431 students and 10 instructors participated in this study. The participants were selected based on the courses that have been involved in the pilot study. Microsoft Excel was used to present the findings in figures and tables. The findings reveal that 70% of instructors and 44.4% of students showed preferences to LMS system as a tools to be used in teaching and learning and 26.1% of students were neither agree nor disagree. However, there are various challenges influencing the level of use of LMS including, internet connections, access to computers, unfamiliar with Moodle and integration of LMS with others university systems. Overall, the study provided an insight into the environment surrounding the early adoption phases of LMS in SUZA, which offers a better understanding of the phenomenon. Subsequently, this will help enhance the adoption process in current contexts and assist in future utilization of LMS systems. © 2019, ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering.","Blended learning; e-Learning; Higher learning institution; Learning management systems; Zanzibar","Developing countries; E-learning; Students; Teaching; Blended learning; Higher education institutions; Higher learning institutions; Learning environments; Learning management system; Semi structured interviews; Teaching and learning; Zanzibar; Computer aided instruction","Mtebe, J.S., Learning management system success: Increasing learning management system usage in higher education in sub-Saharan (2015) Afr.

The purpose of this paper is to present the results of a first evaluation of the MOOC. The online course was used in four different university courses in Ergonomics in Sweden, two given at Chalmers University of Technology in Gothenburg and two given at Linköping University. The MOOC material was used in different ways in the courses: (1) suggested voluntary, alternative material for the students’ self-studies, (2) scheduled activity for self-studies with appointed chapters, and (3) mandatory, selected course material being discussed in follow-up seminars. Data for the evaluation was collected through questionnaires and semi-structured interviews with students and teachers. The results showed that the MOOC served as a repetition of lectured material and gave increased understanding of the theories. The recorded interviews with practitioners and researchers in the MOOC highlighted the importance of the subject in real working life. The knowledge tests were appreciated as rehearsal of understanding. However, the MOOC in parallel with the other course material was also considered to be too much work by some students. A recommendation is to carefully consider how to use and integrate the MOOC as a meaningful, individual, theoretical learning activity for the students. Thereby the lectures in classroom could focus more on discussions and problem-solving regarding the topics and less on basic theory. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Blended learning; Higher education; Human factors","Ergonomics; Human engineering; Online systems; Problem solving; Students; Surveys; Teaching; Alternative materials; Blended learning; Chalmers University of Technology; Higher education; Massive open online course; Semi structured interviews; University course; Work organization; E-learning","Biggs, J., Approaches to the enhancement of tertiary teaching (1989) High Educ Res Dev, 8 (1), pp. 7-25; Blackmon, S.J., Major, C.H., Wherefore art thou MOOC?

This research aims to investigate the impact of using the Edmodo net-work among the students at Imam Abdulrahman bin Faisal University and stu-dents' attitudes toward it. Background The creators of e-learning systems have recently taken remarkable strides, in-cluding the development of a full range of techniques and means of communi-cation. Social networks encourage collaborative work and thus have huge poten-tial to increase information sharing among users, which makes these networks especially useful in academic and higher-education systems. Edmodo network is one of the main choices to be adopted in education process. Methodology This research has an experimental design based on a set of online tests. It also includes the development of a scale to determine students' attitudes toward Edmodo Contribution There is a lack of studies on the adoption of Edmodo within higher education. This research is an investigation of the impact that using Edmodo had on stu-dents at Imam Abdulrahman bin Faisal University. Findings The findings of this research show that using Edmodo leads to a statistically significant improvement in learning skills among higher-education students. The results also illustrate that students have positive attitudes toward the use of Edmodo in their courses. Recommendations for Practitioners Adopting Edmodo within their teaching model. Recommendations for Researchers More investigation on this topic with a larger number of participants is recom-mended Impact on Society This investigation provides society with better understanding of adopting Ed-modo within higher education. Future Research Further work should include investigations of this topic that include a larger number of participants with more diverse backgrounds.

The study analyses data from students throughout this period, and includes consideration of how the student experience is being shaped by academic and institutional support for TEL. Initially the University focus was on use of mobile technologies and 'blended' learning environments; as a platform for transforming pedagogy. In 2013, teaching staff and new undergraduate students were issued with tablet devices. As well as investing in the devices and supporting campus infrastructure, the institution also provided additional support for curriculum and staff development. For two years, students' feedback about the tablets was overwhelmingly positive about their value for learning. In 2015, most undergraduates had tablet devices and TEL was becoming business as usual. However, the evaluation feedback that year showed that use of tablets had begun to decrease and there was a corresponding increase in use of smartphones. For some activities, laptops were preferred. In 2016, multiple types of device were issued to students, with some disciplines choosing laptops and in 2017 the University provided free digital textbooks instead of devices. Students' use of different devices for learning activity has been shifting and evidence gathered internally from students and staff has played a role in adapting to this. While TEL strategies differ between universities, the analysis provides an example of how systematic evaluation evidence can support systemic adaptation as the learning technology environment changes. © ASCILITE 2017 - Conference Proceedings - 34th International Conference of Innovation, Practice and Research in the Use of Educational Technologies in Tertiary Education.All right reserved.",,"Computer aided instruction; Curricula; Digital devices; Educational technology; Laptop computers; Institutional support; Learning environments; Longitudinal case study; Strategic initiative; Student perspectives; Systematic evaluation; Technology enhanced learning; Undergraduate students; Students","Barnett, R., (2000) Realizing the University in an Age of Supercomplexity, , Society for Research into Higher Education and Open University Press; Bhattacharya, B., Cowan, J., Weedon, E., Action research: A means to more effective teaching and learning (2000) Innovations in Education and Training International, 37 (4), pp. 314-322; Brooks, D.C., (2016) ECAR Study of Undergraduate Students and Information Technology, , 2016.

Commissioned programs, on the other hand, typically require a high level of commitment, such as constant engagement in learning and rigorous assessment of knowledge. However, comparatively less light is shed on the designs and impacts of commissioned education than the other lifelong learning and professional development methods. This paper, therefore, presents a systematic empirical study on design, execution and evaluation of commissioned education based on a program at masters’ level for middle and senior project managers offered for seven years at the Department of Computer and Systems Sciences, Stockholm University. The program is evaluated at the end of every academic year, and the reforms are duly implemented. Impact of these reforms is systematically evaluated based on perceptions of the teachers and students of the program. Blended form of courses offering was voted best in contrast of complete online and face-to-face forms, with a structure of classroom meetings in the beginning and the end of a course, and synchronised online meetings for formative assessments. Didactical indicators included problem-based learning approaches that tights the workplace problems into course assignments and formative discussions. Need for pre-planning with adequate information about the course workload and deadlines, increased communication between stakeholders, flexibility and efficiency in the course offers are identified as essential success factors. Emotional support from the family is also recognized as an equally important factor in adult learning. A formal education qualification such as a master’s degree is a difficult goal to achieve in one step, and should ideally be achieved by aggregating short term goals such as certifications of shorter durations, according to the outcome of the study. © The Authors, 2019.

It explores factors that could influence an institution’s decision to implement bLearning and addresses questions that should be answered in this regard. It aims to serve as a framework to strategic and tactical decisions around bLearning as a complement to other learning modalities. Questions aimed at supporting the construction of multidimensional bLearning environments that transform educational practices are raised around themes requiring critical analysis to materialize the bLearning implementation strategy: educational, operational and business models. This work concludes with an analysis of how to achieve the institutional transformation process, including how to articulate the bLearning modality with existing pedagogical approaches such that bLearning innovations become institutionalized and sustainable. © 2018, The Author(s).","bLearning; bLearning business model; bLearning educational model; bLearning operational model; Blended learning; Higher education; Hybrid learning; Strategic thinking",,"Allen, J.E., Seaman, J., Garret, R., (2007) Blending in - the Extent and Promise of Blended Education in the United States, , https://secure.onlinelearningconsortium.org/publications/survey/blended06, Retrieved from Online Learning Consortium; (1998) Preliminary cost methodology for distance learning, , Arizona Learning Systems and the State Board of Directors for Community Colleges of Arizona, Phoenix; Bart, M., (2008) Distance Education - Measuring the Benefits and Costs, , http://www.facultyfocus.com/articles/distance-learning/distance-education-measuring-the-benefits-and-costs/, Retrieved from Faculty Focus - Higher Ed teaching strategies from Magna Publications, Accessed 1 Mar 2018; Bates, A.W., Teaching in a digital age (2015) Guidelines for Designing Teaching and Learning for a Digital Age.

This study evaluated the designed course, with a focus on students' perceptions of course implementation and course materials, through questionnaire surveys and focus group interviews. The surveys found that students especially recognized the help of the video clips for learning sampling distribution and central limit theorem, and the simulations for understanding confidence interval and sampling distribution. The focus group interviews found that students generally recognized the overall support from the three main types of course materials - video clips, simulations and quizzes - on learning basic statistics concepts. Nearly half of the students indicated their preference to first watch the online video clips and then do the online quizzes and further return to the video clips when they encountered difficulties. This study revealed students' need of face-to-face tutorials along different time points in the blended learning process. © 2018 Asia-Pacific Society for Computers in Education.

The purpose of this paper is to discuss the technological and teaching methodologies as well as the unique advantages and challenges of collaboration between four partner institutions on two continents as well as local industry partners and local and international academic and public libraries, in offering a blended learning program to students from six different countries. Design/methodology/approach: The contribution is based on a pragmatic and reflective analysis of the success of the strategic partnerships formed during the M.IT program. The data-gathering instrument used was a questionnaire containing open-ended questions. Findings: Analysis of the comments shows that it is evident that faculty still prefer face-to-face classes. Furthermore, to experience an effective online blended learning, the technology would have to improve. The complicated levels of partnerships were important to provide the necessary expertise for this broad-based program. Lecturers from industries and libraries brought different perspectives based on their day-to-day work and practical experience and, through this, a level of reality as opposed to the theory that can be learnt from textbooks. Originality/value: This is a descriptive analysis of the program and feedback of co-workers that has not been reported before. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Blended learning; Information technology;

This research has two different models which the emphasis of pedagogy variable was divided into two concept: in blended and traditional learning combine with online learning. The research model tested with quantitative data using SPSS Amos, where the total respondents were 415 students from various majors. This research adopt research model from Khan, and add new variable, industrial partnership and collaboration as part of the research. The result from this research, that the most important factor when the higher education adopt the blended learning concept is readiness and commitment of the institutions, both in resources and technology. Another thing that is also an important concern in the application of blended learning is fostering and understanding how to educate students about the learning model itself. © 2018 IEEE.","blended learning; blended learning model; evaluation; higher education","Education computing; Industrial research; Information management; Students; Blended learning; evaluation; Higher education; Industrial partnerships; Learning models; Quantitative data; Research models; Traditional learning; E-learning","Porter, Blended learning in higher education: Institutional adoption and implementation (2014) Journal of Computer & Education Elsevier, 75, pp. 185-195; Means, The Effectiveness of Online and Blended Learning: A Meta-Analysis of the Empirical Literature (2013) Teacher Collage Record, 115, pp. 1-47. , March 2013 Colombia University; Ncgin, M., Dennis, A., Bob, F., A blended learning framework for curriculum design and professional development (2015) Research in Learning Technology, 23; Heather, S., Horn Michael, B., Classifying K-12 Blended Learning (2012) Innosight Institute Publications, , May 2012; Picciano Anthony, G., Introduction to blended learning : Research perspective (2014) Blended Learning Research Perspective, 2, pp. 1-9. , ISBN:978-0-415-63250-8.

On the one hand, the attitude and approach of students in higher education raises the questions whether the Z generation fully accepts technologies, uses fully self-directed online learning, or requires the blended learning approach. On the other hand, educational methodologies are going through reforms and focuses on the integration of digital technologies available in the digital society. This paper firstly investigates the computer usage, the digital learning behaviour and habits of the early Z generation among Hungarian students. Beyond the e-learning courses offered in Hungary by universities either as stand-alone courses or part of blended learning, it must be considered how Z generation students, opposite to earlier generations, who used mostly professional literature and libraries, gather and gain information and knowledge from the web. Secondly, this paper analyses whether the members of the early Z generation form a transitional generation between the Y and the Z generation being rather digital immigrants and not digital natives. © 2018 IEEE.","blended learning; cultural and social factor; digital immigrants; digital learning; digital natives; e-learning; transitional generation; Z generation","Students; Blended learning; Digital immigrants; Digital natives; Digital-learning; Social factor; transitional generation; Z generation; E-learning","(2003) The 2003 E-learning Readiness Ranking, p. 5. , https://immagic.com/eLibrary/ARCHIVES/GENERAL/GENPRESS/E031117I.pdf, Economist Intelligence Unit, New York, NY: EIU retrieved: 16.03.2018; (2010) Digital Economy Rankings 2010, beyond E-readiness, A Report from the Economist Intelligence Unit, p. 4. , http://graphics.eiu.com/upload/eiu_digital_economy_rankings_2010_final_web.pdf, Economist Intelligence Unit, New York, NY: EIU, IBM retrieved: 16.03.218; Saadé, R.G., Web-based education information system for enhanced learning, EISL.: Student assessment (2003) Journal of Information Technology Education, 2, pp. 267-277; Farkas, F., Király, Á., What makes higher education knowledge compatible?

Today, apart from a fully face-to-face or online environment, blended learning promises opportunities for teaching and learning to be done in both environments. This study employed the quasi-experimental, pretest-posttest design to investigate the effects of blended learning in reducing anxiety and improving public speaking skills of ESL learners. Fifty-six students, enrolled in the fifth semester of the Bachelor in Civil Engineering program at a technical university in Malaysia, were involved in the study. The Personal Report of Public Speaking Anxiety (PRPSA) was administered as the pre and post test to measure the students' level of anxiety pertaining to public speaking. The Competent Speaker Speech Evaluation Form (CSSEF) was used as an instrument to measure the students' public speaking performance at pre and post conditions. The findings indicate that blended learning environment does have a positive impact in the development of public speaking skills of these students. © 2017 IEEE.","blended learning; engineering students; public speaking","Computer aided instruction; Engineering education; Teaching; Blended learning; Blended learning environments; Civil engineering programs; Information and Communication Technologies; Pre and post conditions; Public speaking; Teaching and learning; Technical universities; Students","Fujishin, R., (2009) The Natural Speaker, , Boston: Pearson; DeVito, J.A., (2009) The Essential Elements of Public Speaking, , (3rd ed.).

However, whether this kind of education meets the satisfaction of students also should not be overlooked. This paper first focuses on how to measure the satisfaction of education informatization for students in Chinese higher education institution. Furthermore, taking into account different types of university students' satisfaction with education informatization, this study attempts to analyze the mechanism behind the impact of student satisfaction and try to provide a scientific basis for colleges and universities to improve the blended learning. Meanwhile, the study analyzes the impact mechanisms of high satisfaction students and low satisfaction students. Using cross-sectional data from 3,312 students in China, structural equation modeling(SEM) and multivariable linear regression model are employed to developed and analyzed. The results indicate that: (I) nearly half of the students are satisfied with the education informatization in their institutions while the number of high satisfaction groups and that of low satisfaction groups are basically similar; (II) from the perspective of different school types, the number of high satisfaction groups in didactical universities are significantly higher than that in investigative universities; (III) ICT usages, teaching process and instructional design, in general, are key determinants of the satisfaction of university education informatization; (IV) the group of students with high satisfaction seem to be more easily influenced by the interactive feedback between teachers and students and the effect of teaching organization while the low degree of satisfaction were usually attributed to the usage quality, course quality and academic development. It is recommended in this study that universities should pay more attention to the improvement of ICT application strategies and the innovation of blended learning evaluation. © 2018 IEEE.","Education Informatization; High Satisfaction; Impact Mechanism; Low Satisfaction; Student Satisfaction","Curricula; Education computing; Educational technology; Linear regression; Teaching; Education informatization; High Satisfaction; Impact mechanism; Low Satisfaction; Student satisfaction; Students","(2016) On the New Stage of the Development of Education Information, pp. 14-16. , He Beijing Normal, University press; Using Indicators to Assess Impact of ICT in Education, , http://www.unescobkk.org/index.phpid=894, UNESCO; Biagi, F., Loi, M., Measuring ICT use and learning outcomes: Evidence from recent econometric studies (2013) European Journal of Education48, 1, pp. 28-42; Hartman, Understanding Student/Alumni satisfaction from a consumer's perspective: The effects of institutional performance and program outcome (1995) Research in Higher Education, 2, pp. 197-198; (1990) Priorities of the Professoriate, pp. 67-68. , Boyer Scholarship Reconsidered Princeton, University Press; Oakes, J., (1986) Educational Indicators: A Guide for Policymakers, p. 49. , CPRE Occasional Paper Series.

As a result, there is a growing interest in understanding to what extent innovative and interactive educational tools and technologies can be used for designing learning content to support Blended Learning. These tools are used in different courses, however, there is no possibility of tracking whether students are obtaining the maximum benefit. Learning Analytic tools can be used for tracking purposes. However, the data obtained from these tools alone will not offer benefits for improving Learning Designs. Therefore, it is important to build a synergy between Learning Analytics and Learning Design where it is possible to improve learner performance, engagement, interactions, and satisfaction. Accumulated research in these collaborative learning technologies has proposed and evaluated multiple models, frameworks, and implementation tools that engage learners in Blended Learning Environments. However, it is unclear to what extent the synergy between Learning Analytics and Learning Design can support Blended Learning. This paper contributes with a literature review that aims at providing an answer to this by offering insights about the context of use, technologies, types of activities, and collaboration mechanisms developed that can be used to improve Blended Learning in higher education. © 2018 IEEE.","Blended Learning; Educational technologies; Higher Education; Learning Analytics; Learning Design","Computer aided instruction; Education computing; Educational technology; Information use; Blended learning; Blended learning environments; Collaboration mechanisms; Context of use , technology; Higher education; Information and Communication Technologies; Learning analytics; Learning designs; Learning systems","Kitto, K., Lupton, M., Davis, K., Waters, Z., Incorporating studentfacing learning analytics into pedagogical practice (2016) Show Me the Learning, Proceedings ASCILITE, pp. 255-260. , Adelaide; Ifenthaler, D., Gibson, D., Dobozy, E., The synergistic and dynamic relationship between learning design and learning analytics (2017) ASCILITE; Manolis, M., Karkalas, S., Reflective Analytics for Interactive e-books, "" Interaction Design and Architecture(s) (2017) Journal-IxD&A, 33, pp. 33-53; Bakharia, A., Corrin, L., De Barba, P., A conceptual framework linking learning design with learning analytics (2016) 6th International Conference on Learning Analytics & Knowledge Edinburgh, pp. 25-29. , April; Alhadad, S.S.J., Thompson, K., Understanding the mediating role of teacher inquiry when connecting learning analytics with design for learning, "" Interaction Design and Architecture(s) (2017) Journal-IxD&A, 33, pp. 54-74; Wise, A.F., Developing learning analytics design knowledge in the ""middle space (2016) The Student Tuning Model and Align Design Framework for Learning Analytics Use, , Online Learning.20; Salvador Inventado, P., Scupelli, P., An online learning collaboratory to address multidisciplinary learning challenges at scale (2017) Interaction Design and Architecture(s) Journal-IxD&A, 33, pp. 11-32; Eradze, M., Jesús Rodríguez-Triana, M., Laanpere, M., Semantically annotated lesson observation data in learning analytics datasets: A reference model (2017) Interaction Design and Architecture(s) Journal-IxD&A, 33, pp. 75-91; Kennedy, G., Corrin, L., Lockyer, L., Dawson, S., Williams, D., Mulder, R., Khamis, S., Copeland, S., Completing the loop: Returning learning analytics to teachers. in Rhetoric and Reality: Critical perspectives on educational technology (2014) Proceedings ASCILITE Dunedin, pp. 436-440; Hernández-Leo, D., Pardo, A., Towards integrated learning design with across-spaces learning analytics: A flipped classroom example (2016) Proceedings of the First International Workshop on Learning Analytics Across Physical and Digital Spaces.

The research compares perceptions of students who have been subjected to online education along with those who have not been exposed to online education and examines likelihood to take online courses. Design/methodology/approach: Paper and pencil surveys were distributed in different classes in business classes at a university in southwest USA. The target group was undergraduate students. Findings: The results indicate that overall, students have neutral perceptions about online courses, while favorable perceptions are strongly associated with likelihood to take online courses. Moreover, prior exposure with online courses is not a significant factor in forming favorable perceptions about online courses. Research limitations/implications: The present research is limited in generalizability and the institution surveyed in the southwest region is new to online courses offering in their curriculum and not all the participants had prior experience with online courses. Originality/value: Although this paper compares online education with traditional, another option for methods of education include hybrid models incorporating both. A possible third option not discussed through this research is a hybrid or blended learning course, a combination of both online and traditional courses. This opens the options for the student, as hybrid courses can be built with many different options. One includes using technology for “screencasts” or lectures online. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Online education; Technology",,"Aithal, P.S., Aithal, S., Impact of on-line education on higher education system (2016) International Journal of Engineering Research and Modern Education, 1, pp. 225-235; Allen, I.E., Seaman, J., (2011) Going the Distance: Online Education in the United States, , Sloan Consortium, Newburyport, MA; Allen, I.E., Seaman, J., (2013) Changing Course: Ten Years of Tracking Online Education in the United States, , Sloan Consortium, Newburyport, MA; Armstrong, D.A., Students’ perceptions of online learning and instructional tools: a qualitative study of undergraduate students use of online tools (2011) Turkish Online Journal of Educational Technology, 10 (3), pp. 222-226; Auster, C.J., Blended learning as a potentially winning combination of face-to-face and online learning: an exploratory study (2016) Teaching Sociology, 44 (1), pp. 39-48; Can, G., A comparative study on student perceptions of face-to-face learning and online learning (2007) 6th WSEAS International Conference on Education and Educational Technology, , Venice: November 21-23; Conceição, S.O., Competing in the world’s global education and technology arenas (2016) New Directions for Adult & Continuing Education, 2016 (149), pp. 53-61; Estelami, H., An exploratory study of the effects of online course efficiency perceptions on student evaluation of teaching (SET) measures (2016) American Journal of Business Education, 9 (2), pp. 67-82; Gok, T., The evaluations of the college students’ perceptions on distance education from the point of the technical and educational factors (2015) Turkish Online Journal of Distance Education, 16 (2), pp. 84-93; Iwuchukwu, O., The perception of English literature students on examination and online (web-based) learning (2014) Turkish Online Journal of Distance Education, 15 (1), pp. 152-165; Kuzma, A., Kuzma, J., Thiewes, H., Business student attitudes, experience, and satisfaction with online courses (2015) American Journal of Business Education, 8 (2), pp. 121-310; Lim, D.H., Morris, M.L., Kupritz, V.W., Online vs blended learning: differences in instructional outcomes and learner satisfaction (2007) Journal of Asynchronous Learning Networks, 11 (2), pp. 27-42; Lippel, P.H., Sarma, S.E., Willcox, K.E., (2016) Online education: a catalyst for higher education reforms report, , Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA; Mollenkopf, D., Vu, P., Crow, S., Black, C., Does online learning deliver?

The exposure to limitless information and experiences has completely modified their view of the world in ways unfamiliar to other generations. Therefore educators must adapt the content and teaching/lecturing methods according to their expectations. One way of enhancing the learning experience is to be aware of the current attitudes and behaviors of today's students and to rely more and more on the technological improvements in educational strategies. Goal oriented and intellectually inquisitive students prefer experimental activities, which are structured, involve teamwork and virtual collaboration instead of simple narrations and monologues. In addition, students are sometimes involved in part time or even full time jobs that significantly reduce their time of preparation for educational activities. The paper presents an innovative cloud computing approach and its implementation within HyperTraining, a collaborative learning framework for career development and internship programmes. It also illustrates how such a system increases the performance in special education and training programmes, as well as the manner the private companies can help universities and colleges in the education act. Nevertheless, it highlights the importance of blended learning concepts and tools used for knowledge building in the individual study process or technical skills and competences developed within practice activities during special educational processes such as laboratories, projects, even internship programmes, continuing the work started in [1], [2]. © 2018 IEEE.",,"Apprentices; Computer aided instruction; Employment; Collaborative learning; Educational activities; Educational strategy; Experimental activities; Learning experiences; Technological improvements; Universities and colleges; Virtual collaboration; Students","Rad, A., Popa, T., Mihon, D., Iancu, B., Problem-based learning and project-based learning concepts and their applications to engineering education (2017) Proc. of the 16th RoEduNet Conference-Networking in Education and Research (RoEduNet).

WebLearn is the university’s internal brand for the Sakai open source virtual learning environment (VLE). The project benefited from central university funding to support 19 departments, faculties and other academic units to fast-track the development and improvement of their WebLearn presence in order to enhance the student learning experience. This was the first time in the Technology-Enhanced Learning (TEL) team that formal usability testing had been carried out on the VLE used by staff and students for both full distance and blended learning study programmes. The WISE team members devised a methodology to assess certain usability criteria that would be helpful in the context of the project. The methodology included various techniques generally used in usability testing such as first-click testing, scenarios, focus group discussion and memory tasks. The methods and tasks presented in this paper could be further refined and used as guidelines for usability testing on other systems or VLE-re-lated projects. © 2018, Association for the Advancement of Computing in Education.

Integration of face-to-face and online learning with blending learning can enhance the learning experience and optimize seat time. In this chapter, the authors present the teaching of an Algorithm and Programming course in Computer Engineering Education via an artificial intelligencesupported blended learning approach. Since 2011, Computer Engineering education in Suleyman Demirel University Computer Engineering Department is taught with a blended learning method. Blended learning is achieved through a Learning Management System (LMS) by using distance education technology. The LMS is comprised of course materials supported with flash animations, student records, user roles, and evaluation systems such as surveys and quizzes that meet SCORM standards. In this chapter, the related education process has been supported with an intelligent program, which is based on teaching C programming language. In this way, it has been aimed to improve educational processes within the related course and the education approach in the department. The blended learning approach has been evaluated by the authors, and the obtained results show that the introduced artificial intelligencesupported blended learning education program enables both teachers and students to experience better educational processes. © 2018, IGI Global.

An evaluation of blended learning implementation in a university is performed by measuring the satisfaction level of the students in the face-to-face sessions, the independent learning session using online learning, and the overall learning experience with the blended learning environment. Several components have been measured: the content of the online learning, the features, and ease of use of the learning management platform, as well as the interactivity between the students and the lecturer and among the students.

The better acceptance from the instructors will strongly evolve in the accomplishment of the blended learning mode. The aim of this study was to examine the issues in higher learning institution based on lecturer's opinion which drives from their experience with the blended learning implementation in the university. One hundred and fifty-one lecturers from 8 campuses from Universiti Teknologi MARA located all over Malaysia participated in this study. Online questionnaire was used to capture their feedback and suggestions for improvement. Qualitative data analysis method was used to identify the issues and mapped it into the dimensions in Khan's e-learning framework. Results showed that the most highlighted issues fall into the pedagogical dimension followed by technological, institutional, management, interface design, ethical, resource support and last but not least, the evaluation dimension. Hence, higher education management and ICT provider should consider in providing the required competency and acceptable technology, together with other necessary support to facilitate and motivate the lecturers in carrying out the blended learning approach without much irritation.

All this time, in the face-to-face method of learning process, students have not been able to optimize the mastery of knowledge and skills as expected. One of the things that the Information Systems Study Program did to optimize said mastery is applying the blended learning program in e-Procurement courses. This study uses mixed method evaluation approach in evaluating various stages of the process to implement a blended learning program. Meanwhile, the evaluation method used consists of 2 parts of the model namely 1) CIPP, an evaluation carried out on context, input, process, and product, 2) The Flashlight Triad, an evaluation of activities that utilize information technology online. As the final result of evaluating the implementation of blended learning based on observations and research that has been done, there is an optimization of the increase in mastery of students' knowledge and skills, after conducting various activities that are conditioned on face-to-face activities combined with online ones. The results of this evaluation mean that a well-conditioned blended learning program can influence students in terms of motivation, therefore mastering the knowledge and skills of a course can be optimized through the student learning experience. © 2018 Authors.","Blended learning; Conditioned; Evaluation of mastery; Knowledge; Learning process; Skills",,"Zuppo, C.M., Defining ICT in a boundaryless world: The development of a working hierarchy (2012) International Journal of Managing Information Technology, 4 (3), pp. 13-22; Heyvaert, M., Hannes, K., Maes, B., Onghena, P., Critical appraisal of mixed methods studies (2013) Journal of Mixed Methods Research, 7 (4), pp. 302-327; Tshabalala, M., Ndeya-Ndereya, C., van der Merwe, T., Implementing blended learning at a developing university: Obstacles in the way (2014) Electronic Journal of E-learning, 12 (1), pp. 101-110; Maarop, A.H., Embi, M.A., Implementation of blended learning in higher learning institutions: A review of literature (2016) International Education Studies, 9 (3), pp. 41-52; Singh, H., Building effective blended learning programs (2003) Educational Technology, 43 (6), pp. 51-54; Day, J.

There is a close link between learning outcomes and students' motivation to learn. Thus, the success of blended learning in Saudi higher education depends on not only using different teaching methods and massive expenditures on technology but also on students' motivation to learn. The main objective of this study is to measure the effect of using the Web 2.0 technology on students' motivation to learn in a blended learning environment through their attention, relevance, confidence, satisfaction inside in this environment. This study used a randomized experimental research design to examine differences in student's motivation based on their use of Web 2.0 tools in a blended environment in the Computer Science at Al-Imam Muhammad Ibn Saud Islamic University (IMSIU). This study adopted Keller's ARCS model of motivation to develop a comprehensive framework of factors that affect the use of Web 2.0 tools in blended learning environment. A questionnaire was conducted to collect data from students. Throughout our investigation, we found that there was a statistically significant difference at the level of 0.05 in overall student motivation between the experimental and control groups resulting from the using Web 2.0 tools technology. Moreover, students using Web 2.0 tools were found to exhibit a statistically significant higher degree of motivation. The results of this study can help decision makers readjust the learning strategy by realizing the importance of using Web 2.0 tools as the main platform in Saudi higher education. © 2018, (IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications.","ARCS model; Blended learning; Motivation; Web2.0 tools",,"(2008) 'Evaluating Online Learning: Challenges and Strategies for Success', , Washington, D.C.: Education Publications Center; Clement, C., Jones, K., 'Blended Learning vs. Traditional Classroom Settings: Assessing Effectiveness and Student Perceptions in an MBA Accounting Course' (2007) Journal of Educators Online, 4 (1), pp. 1-15; Lave, J., Wenger, E., (1991) Situated learning, , Cambridge [England]: Cambridge University Press; Abram, S., 'Web 2.0, Library 2.0, and Librarian 2.0: Preparing for the 2.0 World' (2007) Library and Information Services in Astronomy, 377, pp. 161-167; Confrey, J., (1995) 'How Compatible are Radical Constructivism, Sociocultural Approaches, and Social Constructivism?' in Constructivism in Education, , Steffe LP and Gale,J Ed., ),Hover: UK; Graham, R., 'Blended learning systems: Definition, current trends, and future directions,' (2006) In The Handbook of Blended Learning: Global Perspectives, pp. 1-32. , Local Designs.

Along with the traditional face-to-face classroom instruction including individual presentation, discussion and debate, the instructor used course management system Moodle to deliver course resources such as lecture notes and supplementary video clips, and to manage many kinds of learning activities like quizzes and assignments. One field trip was also organized to enrich the students’ hands-on experience. The students’ final score and the overall satisfying result of students’ anonymous evaluation held independently and officially by the university demonstrate that the course’s goal was somewhat achieved, for example the students’ independent thought and innovative spirit were motivated.

We make this assumption based on the belief that they are au fait with all things technology when that may not be true. What we are doing is radically changing what they are experiencing as learning delivery methods, compared to what they had expected. Through implementation of these new blended learning delivery models, we have fundamentally changed what they are expected to do as students. We do this without sufficient warning and support mechanisms for this radical new way of learning. We must engage the students in this discussion and really LISTEN to what they want and need. We must conduct robust research that will inform our course design and teaching practices, our student advising and support, and we must begin now. © ASCILITE 2015 - Australasian Society for Computers in Learning and Tertiary Education, Conference Proceedings.All right reserved.","Blended Learning; Flipped Classroom; Student Support","Curricula; Education computing; Learning systems; Blended learning; Course design; Delivery methods; Delivery models; Flipped Classroom; Student supports; Support mechanism; Teaching practices; Students","Calderon, O., Ginsberg, A., Ciabocchi, L., Multidimensional assessment of blended learning: Maximizing program effectiveness based on student and faculty feedback (2015) International Journal of Education and Development Using Information and Communication Technology, 11 (1), pp. 80-100; Dalstrom, E., Bichsel, J., (2014) ECAR Study of Undergraduate Students and Information Technology, Research Report, , http://www.educause.edu/ecar, Louisville, CO: ECAR, October 2014; Foggett, K., Moving student consultations to the cloud: Meeting new demand through eConsult © (2015) AACE EdMedia 2015, , Montreal, Quebec.

The implementation of blended learning strategies allows schools to teach more students more efficiently and furthermore, because students are required to use online technologies in blended/online learning situations, they naturally acquire more technological literacy and greater confidence using technologies in their studies. Digitally delivered materials, either online or blended, also prepare students for lifelong learning and play an important role in their further development. Blended learning strategies also serve as a tool to achieve the required language level according to “alma mater” demands, especially if the number of lessons is not sufficient and learning outputs are high. It is not easy for students to pass the exam corresponding to B1 according to the Common European Framework of reference in four language skills if their entrance level is A1 or A2. The authors describe their experience with blended learning implementation in courses at military university. The first focus was placed upon reading and listening comprehension via online course called English for the Army), but later on writing and speaking skills were also developed. Speaking skills development via Discussion Club shows another initiative and the first outcome shows that this method is effective. Qualitative research, students work analyses and semi-structured interviews prove this statement. © The Authors, 2018.

Methodology This study employed a quasi-experimental pre-test/post-test design consisting of two groups: the treatment condition (sections in which instructors imple-mented the flipped classroom model for the module that was the focus of the study) and control condition (sections in which instructors lectured in the face-to-face meeting, then learners completed the practice online as homework). Learners in each group received their form of instruction and completed the same instructional activities, tests, and surveys. These data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), and Analysis of Covari-ance (ANACOVA) models. Contribution This research adds to a growing base of literature on the flipped classroom, a special instantiation of blended learning. Findings Results indicated that there was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of learner achievement. In terms of learner satisfaction, how-ever, there was a significant difference in which participants favored the control condition. Recommendations for Practitioners Practitioners should select situations that are appropriate for the flipped class-room context. This should be reflected in the implementation of curriculum that would benefit from the affordances of this approach. Recommendation for Researchers Researchers should seek to replicate this study in longer durations and using rigorously developed and validated measures. Impact on Society This study suggests the flipped classroom may not be perceived by learners in an introductory technology literacy course as beneficial to their satisfaction.

Based on much of the current scholarship in applied BL research, current trial and error efforts to improve learning in these new settings are falling short of leading the way to program development. Scholars have argued that such small-scale initiatives fail to provide the basis for a much needed and explicit e-learning theory that institutions can apply on a more general scale. To respond to this call, we report on a two-year longitudinal study we conducted at the micro (student and instructor), meso (Director and coordinator) and macro (institutional) levels of a BL program in a large private-for-profit university in Chile. Convinced of the importance of adopting a sociocultural perspective to move towards e-learning change, our focus was particularly on the perspectives of the BL players at all three levels-and the identities they were mediating. Using a grounded theory methodology within the qualitative research paradigm and an iterative approach to the research design, data was collected and analyzed at all three levels. Data sources involved questionnaires, individual and focus group interviews, field observations, policy documents and reflective journals. The most salient understandings uncovered from the inquiries revealed strengths and gaps in terms of community building, collaborative learning and self-directedness – the essence of any successful learning environment. These findings suggest a practical framework for supporting BL program design and innovation across a plethora of contexts and institutions and we believe bring us a step closer to e-learning theory development. © The Authors, 2018.

In line with this demand for flexibility there has been a need for universities to streamline practices to meet shrinking budgets. This environment has facilitated the growth of dual-mode teaching where faculties attempt to teach online and on-campus cohorts together with variable results. The curriculum, staffing and student expectation demands of these different modes of delivery are often at odds and it is becoming more difficult to meet these demands while maintaining a high quality teaching and learning environment. We would like to share experiences and discuss with like-minded colleagues how to approach this particular design challenge in the hopes of developing some guidelines and practical examples that can inform us all. © ASCILITE 2015 - Australasian Society for Computers in Learning and Tertiary Education, Conference Proceedings.All right reserved.","Academic Staffing; Online and Blended Learning; Student Expectations","Budget control; Computer aided instruction; Personnel selection; Teaching; Academic Staffing; Blended learning; Design challenges; High quality; Multiple course; Shrinking budget; Student expectations; Teaching and learning environments; Students","Barac, K., Davies, L., Duffy, S., Aitkin, N., Lodge, J., Five stages of online course design: Taking the grief out of converting courses for online delivery (2013) The Ascilite, , Paper Sydney; Conole, G., De Laat, M., Dillon, T., Darby, J., Disruptive technologies','pedagogical innovation': What's new?

The present work focuses on an SPOC delivered as a hybrid mobile app and on factors that define its technical quality. The objective is to propose a set of technical quality factors which are defined following a study of literature, focusing on frameworks, labels, practices that are used to assess the quality of e-learning environments, MOOCs, SPOCs and mobile applications. ISO standards for the quality software and the guidelines for the most dominant Mobile Operating Systems (Android/IOS/Windows phone) are also considered when defining these criteria. The proposed criteria can be twofold used: 1) to assess the technical quality of an existing mobile SPOC; 2) constitutes guidelines to increase the technical quality of a new mobile SPOC. © 2018 International Association of Online Engineering.","ISO Standards; Mobile App; Quality assessment; SPOC; Technical criteria",,"Kaplan, A.M., Haenlein, M., Higher education and the digital revolution: About MOOCs, SPOCs, social media, and the Cookie Monster (2016) Business Horizons, 59 (4), pp. 441-450. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bushor.2016.03.008; Jiugen, Y., Ruonan, X., Mobile terminal based mobile learning system design (2016) In Computer Science & Education (ICCSE), 2016 11th International Conference on IEEE, pp. 699-703. , August; Almaiah, M.A., Man, M., Empirical investigation to explore factors that achieve high quality of mobile learning system based on students' perspectives (2016) Engineering Science and Technology, an International Journal, 19 (3), pp. 1314-1320. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jestch.2016.03.004; Soad, G.W., Duarte Filho, N.F., Barbosa, E.F., Quality evaluation of mobile learning applications (2016) In Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE), pp. 1-8. , October 016 IEEE; Peres, P., Lima, L., Lima, V., b-learning quality: Dimensions, criteria and pedagogical approac (2014) FormaMente: Rivista internazionale di ricerca sul futuro digitale, 1-, 2014, p. 117; Butcher, N., Wilson-Strydom, M., (2014) A Guide to Quality in Online Learning, , Academic Partnership, Dullas, 2014; Gamage, D., Fernando, S., Perera, I., Quality of MOOCs: A review of literature on effectiveness and quality aspects (2015) 8th International Conference on Ubi-Media Computing (UMEDIA) 2015, Colombo; Ossiannilsson, E., Williams, K., Camilleri, A., Brown, M., (2015) Quality models in online and open education around the globe, , Oslo: The International Council for Open and Distance Education (ICDE); Ghislandi, P.M.M., ""The fun they had"" or about the quality of MOOC (2016) Journal of e-Learning and Knowledge Society, 12 (3); Stracke, C.M., MOOCs are dead!-Open Education and the Quality of Online Courses Towards a Common Quality Reference Framework (2016) Proceedings EDEN 2016 Annual Conference, pp. 215-221; Lowenthal, P., Hodges, C., In search of quality: Using Quality Matters to analyze the quality of massive, open, online courses (MOOCs) (2015) The International Review of Research in Open and Distributed Learning, 16 (5). , https://doi.org/10.19173/irrodl.v16i5.2348; Yousef, A.M.F., Chatti, M.A., Schroeder, U., Wosnitza, M., What drives a successful MOOC?

More and more of these programmes and courses are designed as blended learning and are characterised by a short time cycle of design, delivery and completion. Despite a recent addition of learning design expertise to the organisation, there is a predominant tendency in design processes to focus on the technical setup, the content and the participants, and very little on the role of the teachers. The teachers’ role is challenged by a number of issues in relation to the growing use of blended and online learning, e.g. the task of facilitating the learning processes of the participants in new ways; a higher degree of exposure as the teacher often becomes the sole point of contact in online environments; communication skills needed to facilitate dialogue and collaboration in an online environment; etc. Furthermore, involvement of teaching staff in co-creation of new learning designs require skills which many lecturers do not have when they enter the design team for the first time, among others skills to articulate their pedagogical principles and technological imagination. Over time, we in our roles as learning designers in the School of Continuing Education have developed, tested and refined a technique for user involvement in the design work, and teachers now work with our professional learning designer and course producer on redesigning courses or creating new module or courses. In these collaborative design processes, we have identified a number of challenges, which will be dealt with in our paper. © 2018 The Author(s).","Blended learning; Collaborative design; Continuing education; Learning design; Role of the teacher; Short programs",,"Beetham, H., Sharpe, R., (2007) Rethinking Pedagogy for a Digital Age: Designing and Delivering E-Learning, , Routledge, London: New York; Britain, S., A Review of Learning Design: Concept (2004) Specifications and Tools, , Report for the JISC E-learning Pedagogy Programme; Buus, L., The learning potentials and challenges when integrating Web 2.0 in a problem-based learning approach (2015) Aalborg Univeristy; Christensen, O., Christiansen, R.B., Gynther, K., Helms, N.H., Schlüntz, D., (2014) Kan Vi lære Af De Andre? – Udenlandske Erfaringer Med e-læring Og Blended Learning I Erhvervsuddannelser Og læreruddannelser for erhvervsskolelærere, , University College Sjælland; Conole, G., (2013) Designing for Learning in an Open World, , https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4419-8517-0, Springer: New York, NY; Conole, G., Describing learning activities-Tools and resources to guide practice (2007) In: Rethinking Pedagogy for a Digital Age: Designing and Delivering E-Learning, pp. 81-91. , Routledge, New York: London; Dohn, N.B., Teaching with wikis and blogs: Potentials and pitfalls (2010) Proceedings of the 7Th International Conference on Networked Learning.

The flipped classroom model emerges in this context to address the limitations of the traditional classroom. When successfully implemented, it can provide students with the opportunity to learn at their own pace and to develop self-learning competences that are useful both academically and professionally. This paper proposes a methodology for the effective deployment of the flipped classroom that aims to assist educators in their efforts to flip their classrooms. The methodology comprises five core aspects: pre-class content delivery, pre-class assessment, in-class content review, classroom active learning and in-class assessment. © 2018 IADIS Press.

In this context, one of the important challenges is the design of versatile quality assurance strategies for training; providers that can guide the development of eLearning programs that achieve real impact in the participants’ lives. The University of Patras has launched a project for the provision of short, accessible, certified distance life-long learning programmes. The main pillars of this project are Excellence, Specialized Personalized Training at cutting edge subjects, Quality, Deep Learning and Innovation. Quality is perceived as a vibrant, dynamic process that is evaluated in the eye of the beholder (learner). Deep Learning goes beyond (superficial) knowledge increase: it aims at the development of transformative knowledge, meaning and metacognitive skills. In this study we identify, propose and evaluate preconditions, criteria and strategies to achieve high quality blended learning online courses based on the relevant experience of the University of Patras’ Educational Centre for Life-Long Learning (KEDIVIM). We present the methods used to assess the quality of the eLearning programmes, key findings of the evaluation process as well as early results of a research study on the quality of learning. The formative evaluation process was conducted by external assessors based on Context, Input, Process, Product approach. The evaluation instruments were online questionnaires, structured and semi-structured observation. The research study on quality was conducted by using an online questionnaire and aims at estimating the level of participants satisfaction using interactive learning methods such as collaborative learning. Early results of the study suggest that the project lead to the rapid provision of eLearning programmes that used successfully active learning methods to achieve high learner satisfaction and address training needs and skills gaps. © The Authors, 2018.

To date there has been little effort to address this need for a validated, appropriate, and simple-to-execute method that will facilitate such an audit, whether it be at the scale of an individual program, department, faculty, or institution. The data are of increasing value to ensure institutions maintain progress and equity in the student experience as well as for deployment and interpretation of learning analytics. This study presents a generalizable framework for auditing digital learning provision in higher education curricula. The framework is contextualized using a case study in which the audit is conducted across a single faculty in a research-intensive UK university.

How educators are prepared to teach potentially impacts the quality of instruction provided in blended and online learning courses. Teaching presence is essential to achieving student learning outcomes, yet previous research has focused on student perceptions of teaching presence. Therefore, the purpose of this mixed methods convergent parallel study was to explore educators’ preparation to teach, perceived teaching presence, and perceived teaching presence behaviors in blended and online learning environments. The study was designed to examine the differences in educators’ perceived teaching presence and preparation to teach in blended and online learning environments. An adapted Community of Inquiry survey instrument was used to measure faculty perceptions of teaching presence. Results indicated a statistically significant difference between perceived teaching presence of facilitation for faculty that completed certification courses in preparation to teach in blended and online learning environments, as compared to faculty that only received on-the-job training. Qualitative responses to corresponding interview questions supported the findings. The findings of this study provide information to university educators and administrators supporting the importance of faculty preparation specific to teaching in blended and online learning environments. © 2018, The Online Learning Consortium.

With the advent of web based technologies, face to face traditional learning is simply not sufficient to facilitate learning. Traditional learning methods need to evolve with technology. This study investigates the use of social media to facilitate learning amongst ISTN students at the University of KwaZulu-Natal (UKZN). The study adopted a quantitative methodology and was underpinned by the UTAUT framework. The findings of the study indicated that ISTN students at UKZN predominately use social media for social reasons. However, social media is also used to a certain extent for educational purposes. The students believe that student-teacher relationship building is a key benefit of adopting social media as a facilitative learning tool. However, reduced face-to-face interaction was cited as a key limitation. ISTN students were most influenced by peers when it came to their decision to adopt social media as a learning tool. However, the findings indicate that current policies at UKZN limit the adoption social media as a facilitative learning tool. © Academic Conferences Limited.

With a theoretical point of departure from Dewey and a methodological point of departure from netnography, this study focused on a blended learning module at Aalborg University, where teaching is based on PBL. A primary research question was investigated: “How can IT support collaborative learning among learner communities in a PBL Master’s program at Aalborg University?” The ways teachers and groups of students could benefit from utilizing IT as a platform for learning were examined. Netnography was the chosen methodology, and the data consisted of the course materials, the reflections, and the dialogues available online. The study showed that including more students allows for more discussions and reflections than including fewer students given teachers describe the task thoroughly and support the online dialogue. In addition, online collaboration allows students to return to the dialogue and re-use it as a resource for their dissertations, teachers can benefit from the online reflections and discussions to improve the educational design of the course, and researchers can obtain rich data from online reflections and dialogues. © 2018 IADIS Press.

It outlines the goals of this new phenomenon, analyses the current situation and evaluates potential limitations. It investigates how, using team-teaching, inverted classrooms and active classroom techniques, potential hurdles may be reduced. How, through careful planning and coordination, students and teachers alike, can be prepared for the new challenge of teaching and learning content through English. It goes on to outline a systematic approach, coined by the authors as the Topic Oriented Mixed-Method System (TOMMS), where each topic is initially addressed in a contact lesson with a Language Teaching Expert (LTE), to prepare students, it then introduces them to the theory in self-study sessions, before applying the theory, under guidance of the Content Expert (CE), in tasks and projects. This paper provides a holistic mixed-methods pedagogical approach to address the issue of knowledge transfer in EMI programmes using state of the art methodologies to allow the LTE to support the CE in planning and teaching of content. It offers higher education institutes (HEIs), who may be averse to teaching content courses in English, an effective system to implement EMI and, for those that already have, it offers ways to improve the efficiency of them. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.","Active classroom; Blended learning; English as a Medium of Instruction (EMI); Inverted classroom; Project-based learning; Team-teaching; Web-based learning","Air navigation; Computer aided instruction; Curricula; E-learning; Knowledge management; Students; Teaching; Active classroom; Blended learning; English as a Medium of Instruction (EMI); Inverted classroom; Project based learning; Team teaching; Web based learning; Education","Coleman, J.A., English-medium teaching in European Higher Education (2006) Lang.

Traditionally, and for various good reasons such as security and stability, universities have had certain online tools and systems for collaboration, while companies and municipalities have had others. These systems support internal communication within organisations but do not necessarily enhance communication with external contacts. This use of different systems creates barriers to the iterative, recurring, convenient, non-hierarchical, and open online collaboration needed in an innovative design process involving multiple stakeholders. During a ten-week Master’s-level course in innovation and design in 2016 and 2017 the 38 students divided into five project groups established contact with five companies and organisations and could choose their own online tools in dialogue with them. This paper presents the students’ and organisations’ emerging practices during the process based on observations and reflective evaluations conducted during and after the course. The results are discussed in light of how socio-material assemblages formed in this special setting and how the results might be used to improve the teaching of online literacy in design collaboration. The result indicates that for co-production of knowledge in innovation and design projects, three new social media literacies would be useful: meta communication, peak performance, and design awareness. © The Authors, 2018.

Moreover, mind maps became a part of modern educational trends like blended learning and computer-supported collaborative learning. Lots of mind mapping software tools are adopted to teaching and learning routines such as educational content delivery or assessment. This paper focuses on the additional automatic evaluation of digital educational mind maps gained from the existing procedures of assessments. The review of automatic graders which support the evaluation process demonstrated that some systematical work is done in automation grading by comparing students’ mind maps with a template. But lots of questions about automatic mind maps’ scoring by retrieving the data from a scored mind map are still open. This paper introduces the automatic grader for educational mind maps (AGEMM) which acts like a teacher’s assistant and calculates several quantitative metrics. The AGEMM is implemented as a web-service and interacted with digital mind maps prepared in the Coggle web-service through its API. The AGEMM is adopted to the Scientific Research Seminar of “Marketing” bachelor program in National Research University Higher School of Economics (Perm). Results demonstrate that scores from the AGEMM may be transformed to scales or criterial levels which are used to evaluation. Moreover, the AGEMM application revealed several problems and shew lines of development which we discuss in the paper. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG.","Collaboration; Education; Evaluation; Grading; Mind map; Software","Computer aided software engineering; Computer software; Education; Grading; Mapping; Schematic diagrams; Teaching; Web services; Websites; Automatic evaluation; Collaboration; Computer Supported Collaborative Learning; Evaluation; Mind maps; Research universities; Scientific research seminar; Teaching and learning; E-learning","Mind Map for Teaching.

Due to the aforementioned key concepts, the main theoretical standpoint is provided by means of andragogy, i.e. the theory of adult education, which addresses this particular theme in its complexity within the conceptual framework of lifelong learning. In line with the author´s previous attempts to analyse the topics applied to the field of foreign language education primarily from the area of corporate learning and development, the paper also draws on the concept of “microlearning” which represents one of the current global learning trends. The empirical evidence is provided via the data collected within the group of students of Master degree programmes, studying the English language courses at the particular technical faculty in the Czech educational context. The comparative analysis intends to illustrate a potential “dividing line” between the pre-service vs. in-service use of the acquired language skills with regard to entering the labour market and thus, the researched group comprises both the full-time and part-time university students. The empirical investigation is centred on the students´ subjective perceptions of the three options of completing their seminar papers within their English language courses. The choice of each of these options deliberately represents the particular primary learning context the students are expected to use as a source for fulfilling the required criteria of the selected seminar paper, i.e. the area of formal learning is represented by a professionally-related English presentation of the previously completed Bachelor thesis, the potential of informal learning is exploited by means of the students´ participation in the professionally-oriented use of English language within the social network Instagram, and the non-formal learning contexts are addressed via a guided procedure of creating a LinkedIn profile in English language. © The Authors, 2018.

The case study objective was to observe in which ways the teaching staff would use the learning analytics module while performing other teaching activities within the course room on the learning platform. We collected raw data from three different sources to examine the hypothesis of the case study in a quasi-experimental setting. The analyzed results showed that over the course of the study, in 40 courses the teaching staff used the learning analytics module at least on one occasion; in 25 courses the teaching stuff used the learning analytics module more than five times; and in 36 courses, the teaching staff has used the learning analytics module on multiple occasions within the same session while conducting teaching activities on the learning platform. As part of the data collection strategy for the case study, we conducted a two-part anonymous survey to collect qualitative feedback about the features and the user interface of the analytics prototype. The results of the survey revealed that the teaching staff used the analytics prototype mainly to observe the learning resources in their respective courses and be aware about the student behavior in their courses on the learning platform. Overall, we concluded that Learning Analytics should be an integral part of the provisioned e-learning services in higher educational institutions; the place for delivering Learning Analytics is the virtual course rooms on the learning platform; and that the teaching staff (if provided) would use it on regular basis in short while doing their day-to-day teaching activities on the learning platform. © 2018 CEUR-WS.

First year students often have difficulty learning the subtle differences between tooth classes and differentiating between them, and many struggle transitioning to the self-directed learning approach at university. This may reflect as student dissatisfaction, lack of engagement and poor academic performance. ‘Flipped learning’ is a pedagogical approach using pre-class activities to introduce new information through online, interactive content and group time to revise key concepts; the educator guiding students in collaborative activities to clarify and conceptualise new knowledge. The ‘drawing to learn’ framework supports and encourages students to interpret visual information and create drawings as a powerful tool for thinking, enhancing observational skills and communicating complex information simply. This approach results in greater engagement, application and a deeper understanding. The aim of the project is to improve engagement, knowledge and identification skills of first year Bachelor of Oral Health students at the University of Adelaide in Dental Anatomy using a blended learning approach. Short videos were produced using simple drawings made on a WACOM Intuos tablet to highlight the key anatomical features of each tooth type, and a Lightboard to demonstrate differences between various tooth classes. Students could access the videos prior to a weekly tutorial and complete a short online quiz to test their understanding. Key features were then reviewed in class and further clarification given where necessary. Using oversized plaster tooth models and natural teeth, students completed 5:1 labelled drawings from different aspects of the focus tooth type as formative exercises. Accurate identification of selected natural extracted teeth was the summative assessment required. Results will be collated and analysed on completion of the project by June 2018 using Learning analytics captured by the University’s learning management system, Canvas. Student satisfaction, engagement and academic performance will be evaluated. It is anticipated that students will demonstrate increased knowledge prior to class activities which will translate to improved practical performance. Evaluation of the project will inform further refinement of resources and learning activities. © Academic Conferences Limited.

Box 257, Maputo, Mozambique","Background: Recent medical education trends encourage the use of teaching strategies that emphasize student centeredness and self-learning. In this context, the use of new educative technologies is stimulated at the Faculty of Medicine of Eduardo Mondlane University (FMUEM) in Mozambique. The Faculty of Medicine of University of Porto (FMUP) and FMUEM have a long-lasting record of collaborative work. Within this framework, both institutions embarked in a partnership, aimed to develop a blended learning course of pathology for undergraduates, shared between the two faculties and incorporating interactive digital microscopy as a central learning tool. Methods: A core team of faculty members from both institutions identified the existing resources and previous experiences in the two faculties. The Moodle course for students from the University of Porto was the basis to implement the current project. The objective was to develop educational modules of mutual interest, designed for e-learning, followed by a voluntary student's survey conducted in FMUEM to get their perception about the process. Results: We selected contents from the pathology curricula of FMUP and FMUEM that were of mutual interest. We next identified and produced new contents for the shared curricula. The implementation involved joint collaboration and training to prepare the new contents, together with building quizzes for self-evaluation. All the practical sessions were based on the use of interactive digital microscopy. The students have reacted enthusiastically to the incorporation of the online component that increased their performance and motivation for pathology learning. For the students in Porto, the major acquisition was the access to slides from infectious diseases as well as autopsy videos. Conclusions: Our study indicates that students benefited from high-quality educational contents, with emphasis on digital microscopy, in a platform generated in a win-win situation for FMUP and FMUEM. © 2018 Journal of Pathology Informatics.","B-learning; Digital microscopy; Medical education; Pathology",,"(2004) Curricula of the Medical Doctor Course, , http://www.medicina.uem.mz/images/curriculo_medicina_UEM.pdf, Faculty of Medicine, Eduardo Mondlane University.

The students that finished successfully this course participated in twelve short (about two to three hours each) workshops, based on a flipped classroom model. Each workshop focused on a specific HCI activity, while before the workshops, a two-hour lecture was used to introduce the students in the flipped learning concept. This was the only lecture in this course, while all the rest of the educational material was offered to the students online before each workshop. Such material was mainly short lectures from the professor, in the form of videos uploaded in the course’s YouTube channel and documents delivered using the university learning management system (LMS). For each workshop the students had to be prepared to participate, which was tested using brief quizzes before the start of specific workshops. The activity presented in this paper was the design and evaluation of an interactive system. The students were asked to form six groups comprising of three to four students each. Then a system’s description, vague enough to stimulate creativity, was randomly assigned to each group. This activity presented in this paper was the longest activity of the entire course and it was conducted in four consequent workshops. The paper presents the setting of this experiment, the peer assessment method and the use of eye-tracking data collected and analysed to aid the students towards improving their design. The students created a working model of the system with limited functionality and improved this model using eye-tracking data from the peer evaluation of this model. The use of these data offered them the insight to improve their models and to undergo design changes. The paper presents samples of the progress made between various versions of the models and concludes presenting the preliminary positive results of the students’ qualitative evaluation of this experiment. © The Authors, 2018.

This expansion has resulted in an increase of online approaches, methods and learning technologies. Therefore, engaging traditional pedagogy is necessary to achieve the learning objectives due to curriculums where the learning objectives are the same for online educations, as well as in the ordinary educations. This paper examines how the use of podcast (mp3) in a blended course can increase students theoretical understanding of an unfamiliar topic in relation to their field of study. This study focuses on the use of teacher-generated podcasts and how they complement the students’ reflective learning skills. The podcast’s point of difference is its flexibility, allowing an exploration of subtly and nuance in complex topics. In addition, they provide an opportunity to present counter examples and discuss implications. This study is based on a single case; a blended course in Communication at University College of Northern Denmark. The study used both qualitative and quantitative methods. The data collections included semi-structured interviews with students’ and participant observations, the latter in form of a workshop. The semi-structured interviews was chosen to investigate the understanding of the use of podcast due to the students' reflection skills regarding the communication in relation to their field of practice. The observations gained in the workshop provided knowledge to understand how the students use the knowledge gained by listening to the podcast before attending the workshop. The quantitative data consisted a survey of 53 students all of whom participated in the workshop where they responded to an evaluation survey immediately after the workshop. The data in this study reveals that online learning resources needs support. The paper concludes that teacher-generated podcasts, where teachers discuss a subject in relation to practice and by visiting, interviewing and including relevant companies can support the students’ reflections and understanding of unfamiliar topics in relation to practice. Finally, the paper provides suggestions for future research and practice of using podcasting in higher education focusing on students with a vocational background studying online courses. © The Authors, 2018.

It addresses the evolutionary process of distance and semi-distance education in Cuba, the current transformations implemented by the Ministry of Higher Education, the technological conditions that Cuban universities have and the teaching practices of Cuban History. The type of work to be developed is descriptive. A mixed methodology will be used, applying ad-hoc instruments such as Likert-type surveys and in-depth interviews, which will be subjected to validity and reliability analysis through techniques such as expert consultation and the Crombach Alpha to surveys, and Kappa de Fleis in the case of the interviews. The aim of this work is to design a methodological strategy based on the use of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) that satisfies the training needs of university teachers, in order to teach the History of Cuba in a blended environment. A theoretical framework of great importance will be developed for the study of the blended-teaching evolution in Cuba, suggesting a new periodization stage in this process. It is hoped that the results obtained will positively influence in the methodological preparation of the professors, who play an important role in the current transformations of the Cuban Higher Education. © 2017 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).","B-learning; Methodology; Strategy; Teaching of history","Distance education; Ecology; Ecosystems; Personnel training; Reliability analysis; Surveys; Teaching; B-learning; Current transformation; Information and Communication Technologies; Methodological strategies; Methodology; Strategy; Technological conditions; Theoretical framework; Education","Aiello, M., Willem, C., El blended learning como práctica transformadora (2004) Pixel-Bit, Revista de Medios y Educación., 23, pp. 21-26. , 2004; Alemany, D., Blended learning: Modelo virtual presencial de aprendizaje en entornos educativos (2007) TIC@aula., , 2007; Al-Huneidi, A.M., Schreurs, J., Constructivism based blended learning in higher education (2012) IJET., 7 (1), pp. 1-6. , 2012; Anderson, T., Elloumi, F., (2008) Theory and Practice of Online learning., , Athabasca University; Bains, M., Effectiveness and acceptability of face-to-face, blended and e-learning: A randomised trial of orthodontic undergraduates (2011) Eur J Dent Educ., 15 (2), pp. 110-117. , 2011; Bartolomé, A., Blended learning (2004) Conceptos Básicos.

We used intensive longitudinal methodology to collect activity level engagement data throughout a semester for 68 students enrolled in six blended courses across two universities. We used structural equation modeling to gain a holistic understanding of learning environments, including the influence of personal characteristics, course design, and student perceptions of the learning experience on in-the-moment cognitive and emotional engagement. To investigate longitudinal relationships between emotional and cognitive engagement, we employed cross-lagged modeling techniques. Findings showed that course design and student perception variables had a greater influence on engagement than individual student characteristics and that student multitasking had a strong negative influence on engagement. Students' perceptions of the importance of the activity had a strong positive influence on both cognitive and emotional engagement. An important outcome of engagement was the students' perceptions that they were learning and improving. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Blended learning; Cognitive engagement; Emotional engagement; Higher education; Intensive longitudinal methods; Structural equation modeling","Behavioral research; Computer aided instruction; Curricula; Students; Blended learning; Cognitive engagement; Emotional engagements; Higher education; Longitudinal methods; Structural equation modeling; Education","Ainley, M., Students' interest and engagement in classroom activities (2012) Handbook of research on student engagement, pp. 283-302. , S.L.

The model aims to support discussions around domains such as how institutions are prepared, the participants' background and expectations, the course design, and the learning process. The research that supported the design of this model was framed by a Grounded Theory method, combining different approaches to empirical data collection with a review of evaluation models on aspects of the quality of Online and Distance Learning. Throughout the paper, arguments are made that Higher Education institutions need to be more critical with regard to the use of Technology-Enhanced Learning, and to support it as a counterpart to face-to-face learning and teaching. The model provides a framework for teachers in Higher Education to reflect and discuss the quality of Technology-Enhanced Learning in their Blended Learning programmes.

This paper describes and validates our university blended learning model, and specifically the massive educational video service that we offer to our students since 2010. In these years, we have gathered a huge amount of detailed data about the students' access to the service, and the paper describes a number of analyses that we carried out with these data. The common goal was to find out experimentally whether the main objectives of the educational video service we had in our mind when we designed it, namely appreciation, effectiveness and flexibility, were reflected by the users' behavior. We analyzed how many students used the service, for how many courses, and how many videos they accessed within a course (appreciation of the service). We analyzed the correlation between the use of the service and the performance of the students in terms of successful examination rate and average mark (effectiveness of the service). Finally, by using data mining techniques we profiled users according to their behavior while accessing the educational video service. We found out six different patterns that reflect different uses of the services matching different learning goals (flexibility of the service). The results of these analyses show the quality of the proposed blended learning model and the coherency of its implementation with respect to the design goals. © 2017 IEEE.","educational video; learning analytics; learning methodologies; learning technologies; massive online courses","Application programs; Computer aided instruction; Computer software; Data mining; Students; Educational videos; learning analytics; learning methodologies; Learning technology; Online course; Education","Stein, J., Graham, C.R., (2014) Essentials for Blended Learning: A Standards-based Guide, , New York, NY: Routledge; Alonso, F., Manrique, D., Martínez, L., Viñes, J.M., How blended learning reduces underachievement in higher education: An experience in teaching computer sciences (2011) IEEE Transactions on Education, 54 (3), pp. 471-478. , August; https://ed.ted.com/, TED ed lessons worth sharing; Kay, J., Reimann, P., Diebold, E., Kummerfeld, B., MOOCs: So many learners, so much potential (2013) IEEE Intelligent Systems, 28 (3), pp. 70-77. , May; Kizilcec, R.F., Papadopoulos, K., Sritanyaratana, L., Showing face in video instruction: Effects on information retention, visual attention, affect (2014) Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems CHI 2014, , April 26-May 1 Toronto, Ontario, Canada; Ferguson, R., Learning analytics: Drivers, developments and challenges (2012) International Journal of Technology Enhanced Learning, 4 (5-6), pp. 304-317. , January; Giannakos, M.N., Chorianopoulos, K., Ronchetti, M., Szegedi, P., Teasley, S.D., Analytics on video-based learning (2013) Proceedings of the Third International Conference on Learning Analytics and Knowledge LAK '13, , April 8-12 Leuven, Belgium; Giannakos, M.N., Sampson, D.G., Ukasz Kidziski, Introduction to smart learning analytics: Foundations and developments in videobased learning (2016) Smart Learning Environments, 3, p. 12; Boyer, S., Gelman, B.U., Schreck, B., Veeramachaneni, K., Data science foundry for MOOCs (2015) 2015 IEEE International Conference on Data Science and Advanced Analytics (DSAA), , October 19-21 Paris, France; Ruipérez-Valiente, J.A., Munõz-Merino, P.J., Delgado Kloos, C., An architecture for extending the learning analytics support in the Khan Academy framework (2013) Proceedings of the First International Conference on Technological Ecosystem for Enhancing Multiculturality TEEM '13, pp. 277-284. , Salamanca, Spain, November 14-15; Qu, H., Chen, Q., Visual analytics for MOOC data (2015) IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications, 35 (6), pp. 69-75. , November-December; Giannakos, M.N., Chorianopoulos, K., Chrisochoides, N., Collecting and making sense of video learning analytics (2014) Proceedings of the 2014 IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE), , October 22-25 Madrid, Spain; Brinton, C.G., Buccapatnam, S., Chiang, M., Poor, H.V., Mining MOOC clickstreams: Video-watching behavior vs. In-video quiz performance (2016) IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing, 64 (14), pp. 3677-3692; Brinton, C.G., Chiang, M., Jain, S., Lam, H., Liu, Z., Fai Wong, F.M., Learning about social learning in MOOCs: From statistical analysis to generative model (2014) IEEE Transactions on Learning Technologies, 7 (4), pp. 346-359. , October-December; Alario-Hoyos, C., Pérez-Sanagustín, M., Delgado-Kloos, C., Parada, G.H.A., Munõz-Organero, M., Delving into participants' profiles and use of social tools in MOOCs (2014) IEEE Transactions on Learning Technologies, 7 (3), pp. 260-266. , July-September; Chen, Q., Chen, Y., Liu, D., Shi, C., Wu, Y., Qu, H., PeakVizor: Visual Analytics of Peaks in Video Clickstreams from Massive Open Online Courses (2016) IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics, 22 (10), pp. 2315-2330; Mercado-Varela, M.A., Garciá-Holgado, A., Garciá-Penãlvo, F.J., Ramírez-Montoya, M.S., Analyzing navigation logs in MOOC: A case study (2016) Proceedings of the Fourth International Conference on Technological Ecosystem for Enhancing Multiculturality TEEM '16, , Salamanca, Spain, November 2-4; Fei, M., Yeung, D.Y., Temporal models for predicting student dropout in massive open online courses (2015) Proceedings of the 2015 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining Workshop (ICDMW), pp. 256-263. , November 14-17 Atlantic City, NJ, USA; Ferguson, R., Clow, D., Examining engagement: Analysing learner subpopulations in massive open online courses (MOOCs) (2015) Proceedings of the 5th International Learning Analytics and Knowledge Conference (LAK15), , March 16-20 Poughkeepsie, NY, USA",07303157,9781538603673,PSICD,"English",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85031904460

Furthermore, previous scholars also highlighted that limited studies were conducted to understand how student interactions and student engagement predicts the learning outcomes among students. Hence, this study is conducted with the aim to develop a quality framework in blended learning by incorporating two new variables namely student engagement and student interactions in entrepreneurship education context. Students interactions were measured using studentcontent, student-instructor and student–student interactions, Data were collected using survey based approach among diploma student in a public university in Malaysia. 281 questionnaires were qualified for further analysis. Data were analyzed using SmartPLS. A two-step approach was used to explain the measurement model and structural model for this study. The findings shows that student engagement has significant relationship with the dimension of student interactions (student-content, student-instructor, and student–student), two dimensions of student interactions have significant relationship with satisfaction. However, student-instructor appears to be insignificant to satisfaction. Conclusions and recommendations for the study also presented. © 2017 American Scientific Publishers.

Many native universities face the challenges of education reformation with the emergence of MOOCs, flipped classroom, blended learning, collaborative learning etc. This study surveyed 113 undergraduate students, majoring in international finance management, in order to investigate their mental readiness regarding flipped blended learning classroom combined with collaborative learning by teaching. After the introduction of the flipped blended learning methodology, the survey was implemented in three classrooms that were taught by the same instructor. SPSS 24 software and AMOS 24 software were adopted for data analysis. Through factor analysis, the mental readiness for flipped blended learning consists of four factors: student attitude, motivation for learning, self-efficacy and group efficacy. Examination of the scale led to satisfactory results in terms of reliability, validity, and its predictive power for student mental readiness for flipped blended learning. Summarizing, the scale can help teachers understand student mental situation and improve the development of pedagogical reformation. © 2017 IEEE.","blended learning; collaborative learning; flipped classroom; learning by teaching","International trade; Surveys; Blended learning; Collaborative learning; Education reformations; Finance management; flipped classroom; Learning by teaching; Motivation for learning; Undergraduate students; Students","Fautch, J.M., The flipped classroom for teaching organic chemistry in small classes: Is it effective?

This article reports on the current experience of a higher education institution embarking on blended learning models. The aim of this article is to present a case study and to discuss the strategic approach to integrating a MOOC at undergraduate level. The evaluation strategy of this experience uses surveys and focus groups to interpret the results and the perspective of the various stakeholders. The analysis synthesizes the opinion of the main stakeholders - the institution, the students and the academic staff - and shows that in addition to improving the financial viability of MOOCs, blended learning models improve the quality of students' education, strengthen students' academic performance, and encourage academic staff to constantly innovate their teaching and learning process.

As the demand for online learning grows, it is critical that tertiary education institutes (TEIs) address gaps in knowledge by developing their understandings of EOT applications. This paper aimed to identify, and describe the application of a range of EOTs popularly used in blended tertiary environments (BTEs). Through qualitatively designed semi-structured interviews with 13 blended learning experts from New Zealand, Australia and Canada, and a 5-step analyses of data, it verified the use of 35 different EOTs in BTEs, including Adobe Connect, Blackboard, Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube. Their key characteristics were summarised using a multi-dimensional taxonomy, called the Pentexonomy, which synergised a range of perspectives into a robust, contextualised, and multidimensional framework for categorising EOTs. An outline of recommendations for the effective use of some of these EOTs was also provided. As EOTs advance and usage accelerates, the outcomes of this research will assist TEIs in their efforts to keep abreast of EOT developments, make informed choices about EOT use, and contribute to the delivery of relevant, meaningful EOT support.

The contribution of student's characteristics and styles of learning to note taking activity and learning performance were analyzed, and the relationships between the two types of courses were compared using causal analysis techniques. In addition, lexical analysis of the contents of notes taken was introduced. Features of notes taken, such as the number of terms, the word ratios of student's notes and the degree of coverage of the lecturer's notes were compared. The results of the evaluation of the two types of learning styles were summarized by determining the relationships between student's characteristics and metrics of the contents of notes taken. The metrics were significantly different between the two learning styles. The contributions of students' characteristics to learning performance were also different. These results provide points to consider for the design and organization of the two types of learning.

Thus, the main objective of this research was to determine the user expectations of e-learning websites of comprehensive universities through localisation based on user preferences. This research showed how users interact with e-learning websites and indicated the patterns that can be used as standard guidelines to design the best e-learning websites. It was found localisation of e-learning websites was scarce and slow interaction with e-learning websites has inconvenienced users. Additionally, too many web objects on the user interface of e-learning websites have a tendency to confuse users. A mixed method approach was used I this study, namely content analysis (qualitative) and localisation (quantitative). Thus, this research contributes to knowledge by guiding users on localising their web objects according to their preferences and hopefully allow for an easy and quick information search for e-learning websites. © 2017 Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.","E-learning; Localisation; User expectations; Web objects",,"Adkisson, H.P., Identifying de-facto standards for e-commerce Web sites (2002) Proceedings.

These methods have been used in the Energy Thermal Master class that is offered in the Engineering School at the University of Vigo. The study presents an innovative learning method in which two new pedagogical concepts are combined, “learning by doing” and “blended learning,” implying a modernization of the classical learning methods. Using the methodology described below, students are able to operate a biomass experimental as well as use numerous measuring devices to obtain the combustion parameters, which are the latest commercial technology. Furthermore, by using LabVIEW programming, students are able to realize the importance of automation in the facilities and to create a code that is responsible for the control, supervision and monitoring of the system. In addition to the purely experimental aspect, students must analyze the data acquired by LabVIEW, apply their theoretical knowledge and exchange data with other groups, improving their teamwork skills. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

How can faculty be inspired to move away from the traditional course toward offering high quality blended learning opportunities for their students? Penn State University's Teaching and Learning with Technology (TLT) unit's solution is the Blended Learning Transformation (BlendLT) program;a systemic approach, which integrates change by combining targeted professional development with sustained instructional design support and clearly documented evidence of success. Blended learning is fast becoming the preferred method for transforming residential courses from traditional instruction to engaging learning experiences (Moskal, Dziuban, & Hartman 2013). Yet despite the interest in blended learning, it can be challenging to get faculty to create a blended course (Berrett, 2012). By embedding instructional designers into a blended learning faculty development program, and providing research support to gather evidence and measure success, Penn State University's TLT unit offers a three-pronged approach to creating blended learning courses. The three elements of the Blended Learning Transformation program include: 1. Targeted professional development provided as a blended learning course, which takes place over approximately eight weeks, 2. Integrated instructional design support provided during the professional development course and sustained throughout the phases of completed course redesign and first course offering, 3. Results shared through documenting demonstrated evidence of success as related to course learning outcomes. This paper provides an overview ofthe BlendLT program, describes in detail the BlendLT professional development course, discusses the role ofthe instructional designer in BlendLT, provides guidelines and samples for evidence of success, and shares descriptive data and case based scenarios on courses included in BlendLT.","Blended learning; Course revision; Faculty development; Instructional design","Curricula; E-learning; Professional aspects; Teaching; Blended learning; Course revision; Faculty development; Instructional designs; Integrated instructional designs; Professional development; Professional Development Courses; Traditional instruction; Education","Berrett, D., How 'flipping' the classroom can improvethetraditional lecture (2012) The Chronicle of Higher Education, , http://moodle.technion.ac.il/file.php/1298/Announce/HowFlippingtheClassroomCanImprovetheTraditionalLecture.pdf; Graham, C.R., Dziuban, C.D., Core research and issues related to blended learning environments (2008) Handbook Ofresearch on Educational Communications and Technology (3rd Ed.), , J.M.

Our study assesses the response of one higher education institution (HEI) to the changing digital landscape and its transition into enhanced blended learning, which seeks to go beyond the early implementation stage to make the most effective use of online learning technologies to enhance the student experience and student learning outcomes. Evidence from a qualitative study comprising 20 semi-structured interviews, informed by a literature review, has resulted in the development of a holistic framework to guide HEIs transitioning into enhanced blended learning. The proposed framework addresses questions relating to the why (change agents), what (institutional considerations), how (organisational preparedness) and who (stakeholders) of transitions into enhanced blended learning. The involvement of all stakeholder groups is essential to a successful institutional transition into enhanced blended learning. © 2017, Taylor and Francis Ltd.

While the combination can be said to enhance pedagogical variety through numerous methodological possibilities for onsite and online learning, particularly the online components are at times criticized for the lack of deep, cognitive, meta-cognitive and social learning. The role of reflection is therefore significant in engaging students in blended learning and enhancing their behavioural, emotional and cognitive processes. This is particularly poignant when developing academic and field-specific language skills in an online environment. This paper presents the implementation and student perceptions of two blended learning university courses for English for academic purposes. In these blended learning language courses, students were provided the opportunity to develop their academic language skills through individual and collective reflection and were encouraged to engage in reflective and collaborative learning with online tools for the synthesis, evaluation and assessment of their own and their peers' learning. In both courses, the visible role of the lecturer was reduced and most of the discussion, reflection and commentary during the course was performed by the students as peer feedback or peer assessment. Asynchronous online tools were actively used throughout the courses to engage students to the reflective and collaborative learning process. In these courses the consistent and active use of weekly tasks, reflection and peer comments were considered by the students as essential to developing their academic English language and communication skills in a blended learning environment. Since blended learning allows students more time to reflect on their thoughts rather than participate in discussions instantaneously in the classroom, this was a systematic and positively received part of the course progression. The results indicate that reflection is an integral part of online and blended learning to promote deep learning, self-awareness and the development of academic language and communication skills. © The Authors, 2017.","Blended learning; English for academic purposes; Higher education; Reflection","Computer aided instruction; Curricula; E-learning; Education computing; Reflection; Students; Teaching; Blended learning; Blended learning environments; Classroom instruction; Collaborative learning; Collaborative learning process; English for academic purposes; Evaluation and assessment; Higher education; Education","Bach, S., Haynes, P., Lewis Smith, J., (2007) Online Learning and Teaching in Higher Education, , Open University Press, Maidenhead; Boud, D., (1995) Enhancing Learning through Self Assessment, , Kogan Page, London; Boud, D., Keogh, R., Walker, D., Promoting Reflection in Learning (1996) Boundaries of Adult Learning, pp. 32-56. , in R.

The review is based on integrative research approaches, using quantitative and qualitative analysis, and includes CoP oriented research articles published between 2000 and 2014. Findings are presented under three questions: Which research studies within the online/blended learning literature made central use of the CoP framework? Among those studies identified, which ones established strong linkages between the CoP framework and their findings? Within this last group of identified studies, what do the patterns in their use of the CoP framework suggest as opportunities for future research in online teaching and learning? © 2017, The Online Learning Consortium.

To this end, the design of an intuitive learning platform that integrates online and F2F learning following a well-established theoretical framework is proposed. Hence, the aim of the present study is the design and implementation of an instructional design workflow based on the combination of Problem-Based Learning (PBL) and Self-Regulated Learning (SRL), through a blended learning environment (apT2CLE Environment) in an attempt to enhance students’ learning strategies and collaborative skills. We conducted a quasi-experimental research within a computer science department of a university, throughout a university course. Participants, assigned to the experimental group, followed the process of implementing the proposed workflow through the apT2CLE environment. The findings revealed that the apT2CLE environment, designed along the lines of PBL and SRL, might enhance students’ learning strategies and collaborative skills. Moreover, a future study should place emphasis on the instruments used to assess the indicators examined in this research. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Blended learning environment; Collaboration; Learning strategies; Problem based learning; Self-regulated learning","Computer aided instruction; E-learning; Learning systems; Students; Blended learning environments; Collaboration; Learning strategy; Problem based learning; Self-regulated learning; Education","Dempsey, J.V., Van Eck, R., Instructional design online (2007) Instructional Design and Technology, pp. 288-300. , Reiser, R.A., Dempsey, J.V.

The reflection presented in this paper focus on different learning experiences, special on gamification and how it can make learning and evaluation enjoyable. We implement a new learning environment on higher education. Instead of using the time in-class for lectures we gave online lectures to the students using videos, social network, webinars and interactive e-contents and use the time in-class to promote debates, synchronous communication with students from Portugal and Brazil and other interactive learning activities. In each class we also promote learning activities based on the gamification theory. In this article we present a learning model that we are using in our institution that combines face to face sessions and online sessions in a global higher education environment. © The Authors, 2017.","Blended-learning; Global education; Higher education; Pedagogical innovation","Computer aided instruction; E-learning; Education computing; Students; Teaching; Blended learning; Global education; Higher education; Interactive learning; Learning Activity; Learning environments; Learning experiences; Synchronous communications; Education","Ash, K., Educators view flipped model with a more critical eye (2012) Education Week, pp. S6-S7; Establishing a benchmark for social media use in college admissions (2010) 2010 social media and college admissions study, , http://www.cappex.com/media/EstablishingABenchmarkForSocialMediaUse.pdf, Highland Park, IL: Author; Quality Assessment for E-learning: a Benchmarking Approach-Second edition (2012), European Association of Distance Teaching Universities, 2012; (2011) UNIQUe guidelines, , EFQUEL Edition. 2011; O'Flaherty, J., Phillips, C., Karanicolas, S., Snelling, C., Tracey Winning Corrigendum to ""The use of flipped classrooms in higher education: A scoping review"" (2015) The Internet and Higher Education, 25, pp. 85-95. , The Internet and Higher Education, Volume 27, October 2015, Page 90; Merisotis, Phipps, R.A., Quality On the Line: Benchmarks for Success in Internet-Based Distance Education (2000) IHEP, Policy Report, 2000; Moore, R., Lopes, J., (1999) Paper templates, , TEMPLATE'06, 1st International Conference on Template Production.

While Blended Learning might be seen as a success in some developed countries, its implementation in a developing country such as South Africa, where there is differential access to resources must be done with caution. Otherwise, the implementation of Blended Learning may further alienate students from under-resourced communities. In the year 2016, the Chemical Engineering Department at the Cape Peninsula University of Technology introduced a web-based homework system, WileyPLUS in its first year physics course, to provide students with support through interaction with technology and also to assist the lecturer in providing timely feedback on assessments. Additionally, a social media application WhatsApp group was formed in order to facilitate learner-to-learner interactions outside the classroom. This paper presents findings of the students' experience of the system in the physics course using ""Moore interaction"" framework. The data was generated through focus groups with the students, which were carried out to gain insights into the students' experience of the implementation ofthe Blended Learning practice used in this study. Additionally, the student's paper based test and student's assessments were analyzed against each otherto deduce if online students' performance translates to paper-based tests. Student's comments on a WhatsApp group discussion during the ""FMF"" protests university shutdown is incorporated to show how a lack of interaction with the computer interface impacted on their experiences of blended learning. The results show that students who reside in the university residences, and have access to the university's resources such as computer and Wi-Fi, have a higher chance of improving their scores in the physics course compared to students who reside outside campus and have no access to computers and data to connect to the Internet. Furthermore, the results suggest that blended learning using the above technologies, if not employed carefully, has the potential to further alienate the group of students with limited access to resources. Some students from under-resourced backgrounds reported that the limited access to computers and Wi-Fi usually led them to cheating in their collaborations due to lack of time to interact with the online system. They indicated that they collaborated with some of their peers who reside on campus in order to get high scores in WileyPLUS, however, failed to perform equally in paper-based written assessment. Findings presented in this paper have important lessons and implications for universities in a developing country as it draws attention to the potential challenges that may arise from the implementation of Blended Learning.","Blended learning; Digital divide; Fees Must fall; WhatsApp; WileyPLUS","Curricula; Developing countries; E-learning; Engineering education; Students; Teaching; Technical presentations; Wireless local area networks (WLAN); Blended learning; Digital divide; Fees Must fall; WhatsApp; WileyPLUS; Education","Basitere, M., Ivala, E.N., The effects ofwileyplus web-based homework system on student performance in the chemical engineering Extended Curriculum Program: Introductory Physics Course (2015) ICEL2015-10th International Conference on E-Learning: ICEL 2015, p. 31. , Academic Conferences and publishing limited; Badat, S., Deciphering the meanings, and explaining the south african higher education student protests of 201516 (2016) PAXACADEMICA, 71; Brown, C.L., Czerniewicz, L., Ifwe build it will they come?

The paper presents the design and evaluation of an online decision support tool for assessment design, which was developed on a collaborative project across Indian and European universities. The tool was designed based on a shared framework of design and assessment principles which took account of the purpose of the assessment, knowledge and skills to be assessed and how and by whom the assessment was to be conducted. The tool was not intended to provide definitive advice but rather to support the decision-making process and professional development of teachers. This support would be provided during the use of the tool and as a summary at the end of the teacher’s consultation with the tool. Overall, users were satisfied with the tool, as the data show, and were positive about using it in designing assessment. Recommendations that were made during the evaluation, for redeveloping the tool to make it more suitable for a wider audience are discussed. © 2017, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.","Assessment; Assessment design; Blended learning; Online learning","Decision making; E-learning; Teaching; Assessment; Blended learning; Collaborative projects; Decision making process; Decision support tools; Design and evaluations; Online learning; Professional development of teachers; Decision support systems","(2017) E-QUAL Enhancing Quality, A.A.G.O.U.E.I.I, , http://www.projectequal.net/equal/index.php; Webb, M.E., Gibson, D., Forkosh-Baruch, A., Challenges for information technology supporting educational assessment (2013) J.

The practical inability to conduct randomised controlled trials in a natural setting limits teachers who want to interpret their design choices to non causal evaluation. With at least a moderate amount of common sense these evaluations could be useful in gathering insight into what works and what does not work in education. In our blended learning course we wanted to assess the role of formative assessment while also taking lecture attendance into account. There are certainly many confounds for which we cannot control. We found no effect of lecture attendance but formative assessments did predict a substantial amount of course outcome. This was probably due to not including the formative performance in the final grading and our emphasis in the course that to err is to be student. The validity of the formative assessment paves the way for diagnostic use and remedial teaching. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Blended learning; Formative assessment; Lecture attendance; Weblectures","Curricula; Grading; Blended learning; Common sense; Controlled trial; Course design; Formative assessment; Higher education; Lecture attendances; Weblectures; Teaching","Black, P., Wiliam, D., Developing the theory of formative assessment (2009) Educ.

Elearning inter-university network of Moldova uses a virtual learning environment for training and learning process improvement dedicated to engineering students. Several web courses, based on Blended Learning methodology are highlighted. Elearning modules provide student with information examples containing rich multimedia elements: text, glossary, webography, bibliography, knowledge and skills assimilation assessment. The modules are divided into a number of teaching and learning units which can be studied autonomously (or independent). Electrical Engineering and Technology (EET) Discipline model is a new approach to learning electrical technology-one that presents concepts in the customary logically developed order but illustrates them with exemplars that reflect the applications students are interested in. EET Discipline resources are especially for secondary school teachers and students, with topics ranging from introductory to advanced EET. These principles focus on a few specific pedagogical pointers: providing multiple representations and descriptions; making linked referential connections visible; presenting the dynamic and interactive nature of electrical engineering; promoting the transformation between 2D and 3D; reducing cognitive load by making information explicit and integrating information for students. © 2017 International Institute of Informatics and Systemics, IIIS.

During their studies, students are enroled in several e-courses. They perceive various aspects of e-courses and show different responses when using teaching materials and learning in an e-course. The purpose of this paper is to measure such aspects from the students’ perspective and explore the differences among various subgroups of students. Design/methodology/approach: In the survey, students expressed their opinions on 13 different aspects (a seven-level scale) of the e-courses in which they were enroled. In addition, the influence of some demographic characteristics was analysed. The authors used statistical tests (t-test and ANOVA) to compare the means among the analysed subgroups. Findings: The empirical results reveal some differences among the subgroups of students. Students’ attitudes to blended learning increase significantly by year of study and decrease according to the amount of other non-study activities. Simplicity of finding materials in an e-course is the factor where male and female students differ significantly. This finding serves as a guideline for faculty management concerned with how to adjust blended learning to fulfil the various expectations of different student subgroups. Originality/value: This paper’s insights will be of value to individuals and institutions engaged in the e-learning process in higher education. In particular, the results will be helpful to the faculty management and teachers with the main task to increase the engagement of particular groups of students regarding the work in e-courses. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Blended learning; Demographic factors; Higher education; LMS Moodle; Public administration education; Students’ perspective",,"Al-Adwan, A., Al-Adwan, A., Smedley, J., Exploring students’ acceptance of e-learning using technology acceptance model in Jordanian universities (2013) International Journal of Education and Development using Information and Communication Technology, 9 (2), pp. 4-18; Boling, E.C., Hough, M., Krinsky, H., Saleem, H., Stevens, M., Cutting the distance in distance education: perspectives on what promotes positive, online learning experiences (2012) Internet in Higher Education, 15 (2), pp. 118-126; Bostrom, C., Educational leadership and the e-learning paradigm (2012) Global Partners in Education Journal, 2 (1), pp. 42-56; Clark, R.C., Meyer, R.E., (2011) E-Learning and The Science of Instruction: Proven Guidelines for Consumers and Designers of Multimedia Learning, , Pfeiffer, New York, NY; Friesen, N., (2012) Report: defining blended learning, , http://learningspaces.org/papers/Defining_Blended_Learning_NF.pdf, February 2016, :, (accessed; Hart, C., Factors associated with student persistence in an online program of study: a review of literature (2012) Journal of Interactive Online Learning, 11 (1), pp. 19-42; Hassanzadeh, A., Kanaani, F., Elahi, S., A model for measuring e-learning systems success in universities (2012) Expert Systems with Applications, 39 (12), pp. 10959-10966; Islam, A., Rahim, N.A.A., Liang, T.C., Momtaz, H., Effect of demographic factors on e-learning effectiveness in a higher learning institution in Malaysia (2011) International Education Studies, 4 (1), pp. 112-121; Islam, A.K.M.N., Investigating e-learning system usage outcomes in the university context (2013) Computers & Education, 69, pp. 387-399; Johnson, R.D., Hornik, S., Salas, E., An empirical examination of factors contributing to the creation of successful e-learning environments (2007) International Journal of Human-Computer Studies, 66 (5), pp. 356-369; Joo, Y.J., Joung, S., Son, H.S., Structural relationships among effective factors on e-learners’ motivation for skill transfer (2014) Computers in Human Behavior, 32, pp. 335-342; Kassab, S.E., Al-Shafei, A.I., Salem, A.H., Otoom, S., Relationship between the quality of blended learning experience, self-regulated learning, and academic achievement of medical students: a path analysis (2015) Advances in Medical Education in Practice, 6, pp. 27-34; Liaw, S.-S., Investigating students’ perceived satisfaction, behavioural intention, and effectiveness of e-learning: a case study of the blackboard system (2008) Computers & Education, 51 (2), pp. 864-873; Lim, Y.M., Ayesh, A., Chee, K.N., Socio-demographic differences in the perceptions of learning management system (LMS) design (2013) International Journal of Software Engineering & Applications, 4 (5), pp. 15-35; Loveland, K.A., Student evaluation of teaching (SET) in web-based classes: preliminary findings and a call for further research (2007) The Journal of Educators Online, 4 (2), pp. 1-18; Mbarek, R., Zaddem, F., The examination of factors affecting e-learning effectiveness (2013) International Journal of Innovation and Applied Studies, 2 (4), pp. 423-435; Ozkan, S., Koseler, R., Multi-dimensional students’ evaluation of e-learning system in the higher education context: an empirical investigation (2009) Computers & Education, 53 (4), pp. 1285-1296; Padilla-Melendez, A., Aguilla-Obra, A.R., Garrido-Moreno, A., Perceived playfulness, gender differences and technology acceptance model in a blended learning scenario (2013) Computers & Education, 63, pp. 306-317; Park, S.Y., An analysis of the technology acceptance model in understanding university students’ behavioural intention to use e-learning (2009) Education al Technology and Society, 12 (3), pp. 150-162; Pekkarinen, T., (2012) Gender differences in education, , ftp.iza.org/dp6390.pdf, October 2016, Discussion Paper 6390, IZA, Bonn: :, (accessed; Saba, T., Implications of e-learning systems and self-efficiency on students’ outcomes: a model approach (2012) Human-centric Computing and Information Sciences, 2 (6), pp. 1-11; Severiens, S.E., Ten Dam, G.T.M., Gender differences in learning styles: a narrative review and quantitative meta-analysis (1994) Higher Education, 27 (4), pp. 487-501; Sheehan, E.P., DuPrey, T., Student evaluations of university teaching (1999) Journal of Instructional Psychology, 26 (3), pp. 188-194; Sun, P.-C., Tsai, R.J., Finger, G., Chen, Y.-Y., What drives a successful e-learning?

The educational systems of all countries accept the challenge by the national labour market. Tertiary education systems are forced to adapt to the requirements from employers. They are always looking for ways to accelerate students deepening their knowledge, sometimes by reducing their erudition and outlook. Thus, education is often focused on a particular client (employer, company, etc.). Russian universities resist this tendency. Wide basic training allows graduates to adapt quickly to any developing technologies and changing conditions of the labour market. At the same time, graduates have very low practical skills and employers need to retrain specialists. Nowadays, the market has changed. It requires graduates who are ready to use their skills immediately. The Russian education system is forced to innovate and use new educational technologies to correspond to the new economic conditions. Despite this, it is also very important to save the traditions of the Russian school. In this paper we research students’ attitude towards blended learning, based on survey results. B-learning is a new promising approach to studying Mathematics with continuous access to the course material from any device with an Internet connection. It is concluded that b-learning is currently the most preferable form of studying. We discuss the advantages of b-learning over the traditional forms and over pure e-learning. Grade ratings of Mathematics students that use b-learning tend to be higher, due to the fact that b-learning facilitates regular and systematic work during semester. Additionally, b-learning increases transparency in evaluation of students’ work. We establish that elements of e-learning in mathematical disciplines have their own peculiarities in comparison to other sciences, especially humanities. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017","Blended learning; E-learning; Inquiry; Mathematics; Survey","Commerce; E-learning; Education; Employment; Mathematical techniques; Personnel training; Students; Surveying; Surveys; Blended learning; Economic condition; Education systems; Educational systems; Inquiry; Internet connection; Technological world; Tertiary education; Engineering education","Rebrim, O., Sholina, I., Syskov, A., Smeshanoe Obuchenie (2005) Vischie Obrazovanie V Rossii, 8, pp. 68-72. , (in Russian); Kyei-Blankson, L., Ntuli, E., (2013) Practical Applications and Experiences in K-20 Blended Learning Environments, , IGI Global, Hershey; Ellis, R.A., Calvo, R.A., Minimum indicators to assure quality of LMS-supported blended learning (2007) Educ.

The article describes a model of a laboratory course that includes a virtual component. This virtual component is viewed as a tool of student pre-lab autonomous learning. It presents electronic resources designed for a virtual laboratory and outlines the methodology of e-resource application. To find out how virtual chemistry laboratory affects student scientific literacy, research skills and practices, a pedagogical experiment has been conducted. Student achievement was compared in two learning environments: traditional - in-class hands-on - learning (control group) and blended learning - online learning combined with in-person learning (experimental group). The effectiveness of integrating an e-lab in the laboratory study was measured by comparing student lab reports of the two groups. For that purpose, a set of 10 criteria was developed. The experimental and control student groups were also compared in terms of test results and student portfolios. The study showed that the adopted approach blending both virtual and hands-on learning environments has the potential to enhance student research skills and practices in analytical chemistry studies. © 2017, Association for Learning Technology.

The paper presents a research project of Mittweida University of Applied Science Mittweida which investigated the special needs and challenges of two non-traditional student groups, student top athletes and part-time students with professional background. The paper will first present the results of a qualitative study with student top-athletes and students with professional background in order to analyze the conditions and challenges of their study programs and additional commitments. Non-traditional students were asked about their learning requirements and resulting challenges as well as their media literacy and attitude towards electronic learning. Organizational, social and didactic challenges were identified. Based on the results a blended learning design - the flipped classroom approach - is introduced. This approach has been implemented and tested within the framework of a class in scientific writing. Evaluation results show evidence that the developed approach met the needs of non-traditional students and supported inclusion. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Blended learning; Flipped classroom; Higher education; Inclusion; Non-traditional students; Qualitative study","E-learning; Education; Engineering education; Human computer interaction; Inclusions; Blended learning; Flipped classroom; Higher education; Non-traditional students; Qualitative study; Students","Abeysekera, L., Dawson, P., Motivation and cognitive load in the flipped classroom: Definition, rationale and a call for research (2015) High.

In a first stage, we explore the perceptions of e-assessment by two primary stakeholders: academics and students. We conjecture that a successful global implementation of e-assessment relies on the simultaneous adoption by academics and students. To test this hypothesis, we: (1) define a technological framework that is able to support e-assessment for the whole academic community; (2) identify three main e-assessment scenarios that cover a range of possible domains and contexts; (3) implement experiments with early adopting teachers and collect qualitative and quantitative surveys from students. The results are analysed and discussed in order to assess the current framework and adapt it further to deploy it at faculty level. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","E-assessment; Knowledge; Learning management system; Multiple-choice Question; Skills","Students; Teaching; E assessments; Knowledge; Learning management system; Multiple choice questions; Skills; Education","Tomas, C., Borg, M., McNeil, J., E-assessment: Institutional development strategies and the assessment life cycle (2015) Br.

One popular application of analytics is Automated Writing Evaluation (AWE) systems. Such systems can be used in a formative way; for example, by providing students with feedback on digitally submitted assignments. This paper presents work on the development of an AWE software tool for an Australian university using advanced text analytics techniques. The tool was designed to provide students with timely feedback on their initial assignment drafts, for revision and further improvement. Moreover, it could also assist academics in better understanding students' assignment performance so as to inform future teaching activities. The paper provides details on the methodology used for development of the software, and presents the results obtained from the analysis of text-based assignments submitted in two subjects. The results are discussed, highlighting how the tool can provide practical value, followed by insights into existing challenges and possible future directions. © 2017 Nathawitharana, Huang, Ong, Vitartas, Jayaratne, Alahakoon, Midford, Michalewicz, Sullivan Mort, Ahmed.","Assignment feedback; Automated writing evaluation; Learning analytics; Text analysis",,"(2010) LAK '11: 1st International Conference on Learning Analytics and Knowledge 2011, , https://tekri.athabascau.ca/analytics/; Bird, S., Klein, E., Loper, E., (2009) Natural language processing with Python, , analyzing text with the natural language toolkit: O'Reilly Media, Inc; Blei, D.M., Jordan, M.I., Griffiths, T.L., Tenenbaum, J.B., Hierarchical topic models and the nested chinese restaurant process (2003) Paper presented at the Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems, , Whistler, British Columbia, Canada; Blei, D.M., Ng, A.Y., Jordan, M.I., Latent dirichlet allocation (2003) Journal of machine learning research, 3, pp. 993-1022. , http://www.jmlr.org/papers/v3/, Jan; Chowdhury, G.G., Natural language processing (2003) Annual review of information science and technology, 37 (1), pp. 51-89; Coh-Metrix, , http://cohmetrix.com/; Dawson, P., Assessment rubrics: towards clearer and more replicable design, research and practice (2017) Assessment & Evaluation in Higher Education, 42 (3), pp. 347-360; Deane, P., On the relation between automated essay scoring and modern views of the writing construct (2013) Assessing Writing, 18 (1), pp. 7-24; (2017) International Educational Data Mining Society website, , http://www.educationaldatamining.org/; (2017) Kibana, , https://www.elastic.co/products/kibana; (2017) Criterion®, , https://www.ets.org/criterion; (2017) TOEFL: For Academic Institutions: Scores, , https://www.ets.org/toefl/institutions/scores; Flesch, R., A new readability yardstick (1948) Journal of applied psychology, 32 (3), pp. 221-233; Frantzi, K., Ananiadou, S., Mima, H., Automatic recognition of multi-word terms:. the C-value/NC-value method (2000) International Journal on Digital Libraries, 3 (2), pp. 115-130; Kincaid, J.P., Fishburne, R.P., Jr., Rogers, R.L., Chissom, B.S., (1975) Derivation of new readability formulas (automated readability index, fog count and flesch reading ease formula) for navy enlisted personnel (No. RBR-8-75), , http://www.dtic.mil/get-tr-doc/pdf?AD=ADA006655, Retrieved from Defense Technical Information Center website; (2017) LanguageTool Style and Grammar Check, , https://www.languagetool.org/; Li, W., McCallum, A., Pachinko allocation: DAG-structured mixture models of topic correlations (2006) Proceedings of the 23rd international conference on Machine learning, pp. 577-584; Liddy, E.D., Natural language processing (2001) Encyclopedia of Library and Information Science, pp. 2126-2136. , M.

As such, profound schooling developments have been tentatively materialized but many others are still flowing. The above emerging advances have negated the extreme practice of exclusive learning text, sole teacher, one classroom, one school location, one daily schedule, passive lecturing, didactic teaching, and negligent paper and pencil summative exams. Factors and means of schooling at K-12 and higher education levels in regard of curricula, instruction, learning, assessment, psycho-physical contexts, and geographic space are transforming deeply due to ICT effects.

During 2012 and 2013, our University adopted MOOC-like technologies to support some of these courses so that a blended learning methodology could be applied in a particular educational context, i.e. by using SPOCs (Small Private Online Courses). This paper gathers a list of issues, challenges and solutions when implementing these SPOCs. Based on these challenges and issues, a design process is proposed for the implementation of SPOCs. In addition, an evaluation is presented of the different use of the offered courses based on indicators such as the number of videos accessed, number of exercises accessed, number of videos completed, number of exercises correctly solved or time spent on the platform. © J.UCS.","Evaluation; Learning experiences; Learning platforms; MOOCs; Remedial education; SPOCs",,"Breslow, L.B., Pritchard, D.E., Deboer, J., Stump, G.S., Ho, A.D., Seaton, D.T., Studying learning in the worldwide classroom: Research into edX’s first MOOC (2013) Research & Practice in Assessment, 8, pp. 13-25; Clow, D., The learning analytics cycle: Closing the loop effectively (2012) In Proc. of the Learning Analytics Conference, pp. 134-138. , http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2330636; Combéfis, S., Bibal, A., Van Roy, P., Recasting a Traditional Course into a MOOC by Means of a SPOC (2014) Proc.

Given the fact that the manner of applying teaching strategies always depends on the specific requirements of a certain area of learning, the paper outlines the basic principles of teaching in programming courses, as well as the possibilities for applying modern teaching strategies in this area. Blended learning of programming is gaining dominance in higher education, through combining traditional and modern technologies and teaching methodologies in classroom and via the internet: in traditional courses - with lessons in the classroom and regular additional forms of teaching via the Internet and in distance courses - with regular lessons and additional forms of teaching in the classroom / via the internet. This paper describes teaching strategies which are implemented within the blended programming traditional and distance courses in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering of Applied Studies in Belgrade: Programming fundamentals, Programming languages and Object oriented design. The methods recommended for carrying out teaching strategies in this area have been described: modernized teaching strategies and the increasingly popular strategies of collaborative, situated and self-directed learning. Considering all the above, this paper can in fact motivate teachers in the given area to improve their teaching and adjust it to modern generations of students. © 2017.","Collaborative learning; Learning of programming; Teaching strategies","Computer programming languages; Curricula; E-learning; Object oriented programming; Collaborative learning; Electrical and computer engineering; Learning-of-programming; Object oriented design; Programming fundamentals; Self-directed learning; Teaching methodologies; Teaching strategy; Teaching","Bonk, C., Graham, C., (2006) The Handbook of Blended Learning Global Perspectives, Local Designs, , Pfeiffer An Imprint of Wiley, San Francisco; Bullen, M., Janes, D., (2007) Making the Transition to E-Learning: Strategies and Issues, , Information Science Publishing; Djenic, S., Krneta, R., Mitic, J., Blended learning of programming in the internet age (2011) IEEE Transactions on Education, 54 (2), pp. 247-254; Hadjerrouit, S., A blended learning model in Java programming: A design-based research approach (2007) Computer Science and IT Education, pp. 283-308; Hadjerrouit, S., Towards a blended learning model for teaching and learning computer programming: A case study (2008) Informatics in Education, 7 (2), pp. 181-210; Hart, J., Social learning handbook (2014) C4LPT; Petrina, S., (2007) Advanced Teaching Methods for the Technology Classroom, , Information Science Publishing, London; Picciano, A., Dziuban, C., (2007) Blended Learning, Research Perspectives, , the Sloan Consortium, USA; Ruth, C., (2008) Cognitive Methods for Training and Performance Improvement, , Society for Performance Improvement; Watkins, A., (2005) E-learning Activities, , John Wiley & Sons, USA",,9789898533685,,"English",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85056005230

The course was based on the principles of distance learning; it utilised the opensource learning management system - Moodle, and it was implemented as an action research project for three consecutive semesters (2014-2016). Its pedagogical aim was to investigate a prototype model of digital learning: the 'interactive evaluation' that was embodied in the design of the e-course and in the cycles of action research. Acting as creators, teachers and researchers in order to investigate the student-evaluators' perceptions of the e-course, we attempted to 'produce' wider knowledge of the assessment criteria within the context of blended education. In particular, the how and why specific learning criteria and critical approach to knowledge can be organised as more general constructivist and student-centred indexes of the learning technology. As a case study, the research outcomes revealed factors related to expression of interest, encouragement for participation and motivation of students to infiltrate, evaluate the e-course and contribute to remodelling its educational material.

Furthermore, creativity receives a holistic interpretation and is regarded as a three-dimensional term. Consequently, the authors will debate the research topic of game-based learning from three perspectives: teacher, student and learning process. On the other hand, computer programming is still hard to learn; as many researchers show that students fail vastly in programming courses, game-based learning seems to be a motivational solution that overcomes the basic difficulties that students face in this field. In the emerging field of game-based learning, there are several approaches that have been tested in programming courses at university level. Three of them are a) Learning to program by playing games, b) Learning programming through game development and c) Learning to program by the development of games for learning programming. This study has been carried out as a comparative analysis of these three approaches. Data has been collected from course evaluation questionnaires, online discussion fora and from discussions with students and teachers involved in programming courses at three different universities. Findings show that all three approaches seem to have a promising potential but there are also some identified minor problems. The recommendation is to blend these approaches and to combine them with traditional instructional design for programming education. The outcome of the study is the design of a model of learning for students in programming education.","Blended learning; Creativity; Game-based learning game construction; Model of learning; Programming education","C (programming language);

The effects of this teaching model on student performance in terms of problem solving and learning attitudes were investigated. Design/methodology/approach: Students in both groups completed assessments of problem-solving attitudes and learning attitudes both one week both before and after experimental instruction. Collected data were analyzed using one-way ANCOVA. Group discussions and student interviews were recorded and treated as part of the data analysis. Findings: The study produced the following findings: the experimental group was found to perform better than the control group in terms of learning attitudes, but the results were not statistically significant; the experimental group was found to outperform the control group in terms of problem-solving attitudes, and the difference was statistically significant; lesson plan contents need to be designed based on problem-based learning theory, and reflect real-world conditions; participants in the experimental group approved of the blended PBL and group discussion approach. Originality/value: Results are expected to provide a useful reference for educators and researchers. These findings can be applied to relevant instructional fields to enhance learner motivation and engagement, thus improving learning outcomes. © 2017, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Bioinformatics course; Blended learning; Learning attitude; Moodle; Problem-based learning; Problem-solving attitude",,"Abdulla, A.M., Watkins, L.O., Henke, J.S., Weitz, F.I., Frank, M.J., Classroom use of personal computers in medical education: a practical approach (1983) Medical Education, 17 (4), pp. 229-232; Chen, C.C., Chen, C.Y., Exploring the effect of learning styles on learning achievement in a u-museum (2017) Interactive Learning Environments, , http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10494820.2017.1385488; Chen, C.C., Huang, T.C., Learning in a u-museum: developing a context-aware ubiquitous learning environment (2012) Computers & Education, 59 (3), pp. 873-883; Chen, C.C., Lin, P.H., Development and evaluation of a context-aware ubiquitous learning environment for astronomy education (2016) Interactive Learning Environments, 24 (3), pp. 644-661; Cho, K.L., Jonassen, D.H., The effects of argumentation scaffolds on argumentation and problem solving (2002) Education Technology Research and Development, 50 (3), pp. 5-22; Fishbein, M., Ajzen, I., Attitudes and normative beliefs as factors influencing behavioral intentions (1972) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 21 (1), pp. 1-9; Heppner, P.P., Petersen, C.H., The development and implications of a personal problem-solving inventory (1982) Journal of Counseling Psychology, 29 (1), pp. 66-75; Huang, T.C., Chen, C.C., Chou, Y.W., Animating eco-education: to see, feel, and discover in an augmented reality-based experiential learning environment (2016) Computers & Education, 96 (C), pp. 72-82; McLinden, M., McCall, S., Hinton, D., Weston, A., Douglas, G., Developing online problem-based resources for the professional development of teachers of childrenwith visual impairment (2006) Open Learning, 21 (3), pp. 237-251; Rosenberg, M.J., (2001) E-Learning: Strategies for Delivering Knowledge in ther Digital Age, , McGraw-Hill, New York, NY; Schoenfeld, A.H., Herrmann, D.J., Problem solving and knowledge structure in expert and novice mathematical problem solvers (1982) Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition, 8 (1), pp. 484-494; Singh, H., Building effective blended learning program (2003) Education and Technology, 43 (6), pp. 51-54; Singh, H., Reed, C., (2001), A white paper: achieving success with blended learning.

It focuses on the connection between stress load and behaviour of university students. In the research the following areas are monitored: life style, living and social conditions and the influence of negative emotions on stress increase. The method of the research is subjective questioning and statistical processing of correlations in the field of frustration tolerance, handling stress and psychosomatic symptoms. The first empirical survey was going on in the years 2011–2013 among 1322 university students in total, They were from the Faculty of Informatics and Management in Hradec Králové – the study branches of Applied Informatics, Financial Management, Information Management, Management of Tourism and Sport Management – and also from the Faculty of Pharmacy of Charles University in Prague. In the area of psychosomatic symptoms significant correlations have been found for all items in relation to health damaging strategies, so called malcoping strategies. The second empirical survey monitored the sample of respondents in the years 2015–2016. 191 students participated in the research, all of them studying at the Faculty of Informatics and Management in Hradec Králové – the branches Applied Informatics, Financial Management, Information Management and Management of Tourism. Statistical evaluation was carried here with the help of correlation of handling stress area in relation to other monitored items. In the items directed to the section of psychosomatic symptoms significant correlations have been found again almost in all questions in relation to malcoping strategies. Of all types of items the best correlation was in the vulnerability section. The electronic online application which enabled subjective questioning and classification into stress factors was set up and placed on the web. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Frustration tolerance; Handling stress; Life style; Psychosomatic symptoms; Statistical correlations","Information management; Students; Surveys; Teaching; Frustration tolerances; Handling stress; Life styles; Psychosomatic symptoms; Statistical correlation; Education","Gillernová, I., Kebza, V., Rymeš, M., (2011) Psychologické Aspekty změn V české společnosti, pp. 24-25. , Grada Publishing, pp; Bronfenbrenner, U., (1996) The Ecology of Human Development: Experiments by Nature and Design, , Harvard University Press, Cambridge; Goleman, D., (1997) Emočníinteligence, , Prague, Columbus; Wolfson, A.R., Bridging the gap between research and practice: What will adolescents’ sleep-wake patterns look like in the 21th century?

Background With an increasing number of K-12 students learning online within full-time online schools and in blended learning environments, universities must prepare future educators to teach in virtual environments including clinical practice. Be-fore engaging in online field placement, preservice teachers must be oriented to online K-12 teaching and learning. Methodology Using a design-based, mixed-method research methodology, this study drew samples from four sections of a hybrid technology integration course. Preserv-ice teachers' papers detailing their perceptions, focus groups, and surveys were used to gauge changes in perceptions of online learning after participating in online teaching and learning activities. Contribution The study demonstrated that an exposure to online K-12 classrooms stimulated preservice teachers' interest in online teaching as they began to feel that online education could be equivalent to traditional education. Findings Students' perceptions positively improved the equivalency of online learning to traditional schooling, the possibility of positive relationships between teachers and students, and the ability to create interactive learning. Students also report-ed being more knowledgeable and showed increased interest in participating in virtual field experiences. Future Research Future research may continue to examine if the exposure course, combined with a short-term clinical experiences and long-term online apprenticeships may serve to prepare graduates with the skills necessary to teach in classrooms of the future.","Online learning; Online schools; Online teaching; Preservice teachers; Virtual schools","Computer aided instruction; Curricula; Distance education; E-learning; Education; Societies and institutions; Students; Virtual reality; Online learning; Online schools; Online teaching; Pre-service teacher; Virtual schools; Teaching","Anderson, T., Shattuck, J., Design-based research A decade of progress in education research?

The growth of e-learning application is accelerating through both offline and online system. These innovative systems are changing the face of learning as we know it. However, what is known about these innovative approaches to training has been limited by the shortage of scientifically evaluation. This study aims to assess students' satisfaction and preference toward a multimedia learning system. This paper describes the evaluation of a package of a Multimedia e-learning system for Computer Aided Design (CAD) practice course. This study develops a questionnaire based on usability evaluation method for a Multimedia e-learning system. The method extends the current practice by focusing not only on cognitive but also affective considerations that may influence e-learning usability. This paper presents findings from a study of the impact of the learning systems. The study also describes designing evaluation sheet, data collection and analysis strategies of a case study on the evaluation of the multimedia learning system implemented for Computer Assisted Design (CAD) Practice Course in Ritsumeikan Asia Pacific University (APU), Japan. © 2016 IEEE.","Blended Learning; Computer Aided Design (CAD) course; Content Evaluation; e-Learning System; Factor Analysis; Impact; Satisfaction; Usability","Computer aided analysis; Computer aided design; Curricula; E-learning; Factor analysis; Learning systems; Multimedia systems; Surveys; Blended learning; Content Evaluation; Impact; Satisfaction; Usability; Computer aided instruction","Piskurich, G.M., (2003) The AMA Handbook of E-Learning, Effective Design, Implementation, and Technology Solutions, , AMACOM; Wu Wen-Chieh, C., Lan Yin, H., The effectiveness of e-larning for blended courses in colleges: A multi-level empirical study (2010) International Journal OfElectronic Business Management, 8 (4), pp. 301-310; http://www.tricad.co.za/turbocad-2d-Audio-visual-Training-guide/; Paechter, M., Maier, B., Macher, D., Studentsexpectations of, and experiences in e-learning: Their relation to learning achievements and course satisfaction (2010) Computers & Education, 54, pp. 222-229; Zhang, P., Bhattacharyya, S., Students views of a learning management system: A longitudinal qualitative study (2008) The Communications of the Association for Information Systemsf 2008, 23, pp. 351-374; Wen, J.R., Shih, W.L., Exploring the information literacy competence standards for elementary and high school teachers (2008) Computers & Education, 50 (3), pp. 787-806; Yacob, A., Kadir, A.Z.A., Zainudin, O., Zurairah, A., Student awareness towards e-learning in education (2012) Procedia-Social and Behavioral Sciences, 67, pp. 93-101; Liaw, S.S., Huang, H.M., A study of investigating learners attitudes toward e-learning (2011) 5th International Conference on Distance Learning and Education, IPCSIT, 12. , IACSIT Press, Singapore; Mehra, V., Omidian, F., Examining students attitudes towards e-learning: A case from India (2011) Malaysian Journal of Educational Technology, 11 (2), pp. 13-18; Bhuasiri, W., Xaymoungkhoun, O., Zo, H., Rho, J.J., Ciganek, A.P., Critical success factors for e-learning in developing countries: A comparative analysis between ICT experts and faculty (2012) Com-puters & Educationf 2012, 58, pp. 843-855; Zhu, C., Student satisfaction, performance and knowledge construction in online collaborative learning (2012) .

Nevertheless, the use of technology and open educational resources (OER) promote greater efficiency and social penetration. The objective of this research is to analyze how the attributes of innovation develop when OER are integrated with learning environments that promote digital skills. Case study and data recollection were applied to the interview, the log, the observation, and the document analysis. Results indicated that a combination of innovation attributes generates a change in: a) educational methodology, b) technological tools and ways to present its contents, and c) the way the teacher thinks and students act. The use of innovative elements allowed subjects to overcome space and time barriers, setting the foundation for the development of blended learning in the institution. © 2016, The Author(s).","Collaborative work; Digital competencies; Educational innovation; Open educational resources (OER); Web 2.0 tools",,"ACRL, (2000) Information literacy competency standards for higher education, , http://www.ala.org/ala/mgrps/divs/acrl/standards/standards.pdf, Retrieved from; Anafo, P., Filson, C., (2014) Promoting information literacy among undergraduate students of Ashesi University College, Ghana, , http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/libphilprac/1032, Library Philosophy and Practice (e-journal).

The role of soft skills in terms of personal growth, employability, social development, social participation, change adaptation, etc. has been widely acknowledged although there is no agreement regarding the differential importance of some soft skills over others. However, the latter point is relative given that it depends on the field of reference. Despite the fact that these competencies are highly valued in the labor market, universities seem to overlook this demand throughout students’ education process and the development and assessment of these competencies have been given but scant attention. Further, the increasing emphasis on the use of ICTs in university education and a gradual trend towards blended-learning and virtual environments have prevented the development of these competencies as they are thought to require face-to-face interaction amongst classmates and between students and teachers. This study presents the results of an innovative proposal that intends to break these barriers by focusing on promoting the learning and assessment of team work skills in virtual environments. These results prove the suitability of the program when it comes to developing and evaluating these skills in a b-learning environment. © 2016, The Author(s).","Blended-learning; Problem-based learning; Soft skills; Team work",,"Álvarez, M.L., Fidalgo, R., Arias-Gundín, O., La eficacia de las metodologías activas en el rendimiento del alumnado de magisterio (2009) Actas do X Congresso Internacional Galego-Português de Psicopedagogia, , Universidade do Minho, Braga; (2006) «Definición de competencias específicas y genéricas del ingeniero en informática», , http://di002.edv.uniovi.es/~albizu/articulos/ice06b.pdf, Aquilino AJ, de Andrés J, Nieto C y otros [artículo en línea].

Hence, the purpose of this study is to validate a scale used to evaluate the degree to which the students perceive the five aspects of instructional design: objectives, curricular content, learning activities, educational resources, and the existing evaluation strategy at the Costa Rica Institute of Technology (TEC). Through the use of an analytical and descriptive study, as well as qualitative and quantitative techniques, a Likert evaluation scale was designed. According to the results, the final version of the instrument consisted of 33 items and had a confidence coefficient of 0.923. In regards to the evidence associated to its validity, it was possible to verify the representability and relevance of the instructional design components and their factorial structure. The main conclusion obtained from this study is the importance of measuring, from a systemic perspective, the instructional design components, in classroom, blended learning and virtual courses with tools that are properly validated in order to guarantee the confidence level and valid interpretation of the results. © 2016, The Author(s).","Higher education; Instructional design; Learning environments; Validation",,"Arjona, M., Blando, M., (2007) Diseño Instruccional, elemento clave en el desarrollo de cursos para Ambientes Virtuales de Aprendizaje, , http://bibliotecadigital.conevyt.org.mx/colecciones/documentos/somece/51.pdf; Bates, T., Sangrà, A., (2011) Managing technology in higher education: Strategies for transforming teaching and learning, , John Wiley & Sons, San Francisco; Berger, C., Kam, R., (1996) Education 626: Educational Software Design and Authoring, , http://www.umich.edu/~ed626/define.html; Bernard, R.M., Abrami, P.C., Lou, Y., Borokhovski, E., Wade, A., Wozney, L., Fiset, M., Huang, B., How does distance education compare to classroom instruction?

Through this paper, the author discusses the impact of the methods adopted as part of the experiment, on the interest of the students and their respective performance. The sample consisted of 22 postgraduate computer science students. Their responses to the instruments administered, their scores and their LMS access logs were analyzed. The author was able to achieve statistically significant results with respect to the students' interest and their performance, for mainly two strategies - integration of LMS, and teaching the topics by developing an application in multiple phases throughout the duration of the course. It was found that with regards to project work, continuous interaction with the instructor was a desired and accepted approach by the students.

Courses disseminated are either fully online or on a blended learning mode. While the growth rate of online learning is higher compared to the traditional mode, we also find that online learners lack the pedagogical support to help them pursue successfully their studies online. With a growing feeling of isolation due to lack of interaction online, they end up withdrawing from the course. Whereby the necessity to develop an online learning environment to meet the pedagogical needs of students. In support to higher education institutions, learning management systems (LMS) provide the core learning platforms for an online environment. However to assess how effective an online learning environment is, universities need to measure how well these LMS deliver their key functions and fulfill the pedagogical needs of learners online. This paper explores initially the perceptions of learners following the use of Moodle as well as the barriers they face. This exploratory study was conducted through a web survey to learners engaged in blended learning. Once the data was collected and analyzed, with the use of the Community of Inquiry Framework, which is considered as the model which provides insights to the dimensions of an effective online learning environment, we explored how effective the main functionalities and tools available on Moodle provided the pedagogical supports students needed online. Overall results show that students use Moodle to access notes rather than as an online learning environment where interaction between peers and instructor should have been done. The mapping results show that modules are present on Moodle to support learners in their studies. However the functionalities and tools need to be used fully to be beneficial. © 2016 IEEE.","community of inquiry framework; learning management systems; moodle; online learning","Computer aided instruction; Education; Education computing; Learning systems; Online systems; Societies and institutions; Students; Teaching; Community of inquiry; Higher education institutions; Information and Communication Technologies; Learning management system; moodle; Online learning; Online learning environment; Pedagogical supports; E-learning","Allen, I.E., Seaman, J., Changing course: Ten years of tracking online education in the United States (2013) Nurs.

And it is particularly useful as a methodological strategy in facilitating the reconciliation of data in different contexts without committing errors of interpretation. This is the case of the research that we present here, which focuses on verifying the convergence or overlap of results obtained after the application of different methods of information collection (questionnaire and interviews) on the same object of study: Ascertaining the empirical validity of the b-learning model with regard to teaching in the university context and analysing to what degree it is possible to explain the process of adoption, use and dissemination of b-learning by university teachers in their regular teaching practice and the impact of these determinants in certain individual variables, taking as a reference the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) and Rogers's innovation-decision model.

In this study, university students in first year engineering were required to collaborate and inquire in a blended course design over a semester-long course. This study investigates their approaches to inquiry and online learning technologies as they collaborated both in class and online. The results identify sub-groups within the population sample (n > 200) which reported qualitatively different experiences of how they approached inquiry and used the online learning technologies. The results also measure aspects of their collaborations which help to explain why some students were more successful than others.

As this is a new phenomenon, there are limitations and constraints on theoretical sampling to support the phenomenon. Thus, the grounded theory approach is being suggested to support the formulation of the theoretical framework of understanding the phenomenon. The main objective of this research is to propose a research framework for framing Grounded Theory Method (GT) in blended learning adoption patterns. The Grounded Theory Method (GTM) is presented as a method having both phenomenological and positivistic roots. A social constructionist version and application of grounded theory will be used.

Mobile learning is supported by various technologies such as via voice communication, learning portal on the web, short message service (SMS) and also social media. Mobile technologies are now more established, ubiquitous and interconnected. There are problems in the current learning environment that is too rigid to new generation student in the 21st century that only focused for teacher-centered learning and limit students’ potential to be flexible, creative and innovative. Mobile learning is still under research by educators and researchers in Malaysia. Mobile learning is still in new in Malaysia because the studies on it are still in the circle of establishing idea, theory, design, types of learning and activities using mobile technologies. The main objective of this study is to investigate the mobile learning readiness among undergraduate students. One local university in Malaysia is being selected as a case study. A survey questionnaire was conducted involving 302 undergraduate students from a non-IT faculty at a local university in November 2015 as a case study. A test of independent using Mann-Whitney U Test was conducted by adopting Technology Readiness Index 2.0 to test the significant different between the technology readiness index dimensions towards students’ group of experience using mobile devices and type of students’ groupings (junior/senior). The findings revealed that readiness level varies according to different dimensions of Technology Readiness Index 2.0 (TRI 2.0) and varies based on experience on using mobile devices and students’ groupings (junior/senior). The findings provide motivations for policy and guideline development associated with the implementation of mobile learning for non-IT students in the blended learning environment in Malaysia, that are customized based on experience of students using mobile devices and grouping of students (junior/senior). © 2016 American Scientific Publishers.

Furthermore, the social capital framework has scarcely been used to explain online participation in educational settings, despite its prevalence in virtual contexts. The present study aims to uncover the unique predictive value of altruism, perceived learning benefits as a measure of performance expectancy, and social capital with regard to adult learners' online participation in addition to socio-demographic variables. A questionnaire was administered and completed by 181 adult learners following a blended learning program in Flanders (Belgium). Hierarchical multiple regressions revealed that working learners, lower degree holders, and females are the keenest participants in online participation. We also found that performance expectancy outweighed altruism in explaining online participation. Only two dimensions of social capital, namely sense of belonging and norms of reciprocity, significantly predicted online participation. Based on these findings, pedagogical and research implications are discussed. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

For the purposes of this study, faculty governance was defined as formally established bodies in colleges and universities such as senates, councils, and collective bargaining organizations that are affiliated with the American Association of University Professors (AAUP). While there have been many studies on the perceptions of students, faculty, and administrators, there has been very little research on the perceptions of faculty governance leaders who hold critical positions in colleges and universities. Governance leaders are at the crux of approval processes that influence the development of curricula, faculty personnel policies, and academic programs, all of which can impact the implementation of online and blended learning initiatives. The research methodology for this study included a survey sent to a sample of governance leaders at U.S. institutions of higher education and follow-up phone interviews or email correspondence with a small number of volunteers. The sample was identified using an American Association of University Professors (AAUP) membership list. The results of this study provide important new information on the perceptions of this influential group of leaders on matters related to online and blended learning. © 2016, Sloan Consortium.

One of the main challenges of these approaches is fully integrating the traditional brick-and-mortar classes with online learning environments in an efficient and flexible way. In this paper, we present a set of requirements to be met by a computer system in order to adequately support both students and teachers in a B-Learning context.

An overview of the ways in which the concept of blended learning is interpreted in the Australian higher education is presented. This is followed by a discussion of the results of research carried out at one Australian University about teachers' conceptions on blended learning and their approaches to design and teaching in higher education. On the basis of twelve interviews with teachers, some important factors are analyzed pertaining to pedagogical, technological, interface, evaluation dimensions as well as resource support, management, ethical and institutional. Research results indicate that teachers consider their subject's learning objectives and apply the technologies and approaches that will work best for their students following the eight dimensions of blended learning environments. © 2016 by IGI Global.

This research work is oriented to measure the effectiveness of mobile learning as blended learning tool in Arab Open University-Bahrain branch, in order to review, updates and reinforcement where a self-Administered questionnaire was used to gather the data. The study explains the important factors that influence acceptance of mobile learning among university students. The population of the survey was limited to undergraduate students in Arab Open University (AOU). On line survey conducted with 130 learners, response rate was high at approximately 95%. This study investigated the impact of a number of factors on learners' attitudes towards acceptance of m-learning in AOU, the learners' perspective of future of m-learning, and the overall attitudes towards m-learning. The results show that some of the independent m-learning metrics affect learners' attitudes towards m-learning, like mobile usage in educational sector and wireless technology.

Design/methodology/approach: The presented methodology is based on the main principles of flexible and blended learning. The authors considered three main aspects: student’s background, the level of knowledge and the most suitable style of learning. At the beginning of the course, students were randomly divided into reference and test group. The test group students were continuously supported by different tools within an e-learning environment. The learning process for the reference group students was held in a traditional form. Findings: The success of the experiment presented in this paper is demonstrated by comparing the results of the test group who were taught using the new strategy with the reference group who were taught in a common way. The statistical analysis shows that the test group students had better achievements compared to the reference group. Research Limitations/implications: This presented study was carried out with non-IT first-year university students from social sciences, economics and technical faculties. Each year the number of students varied from 150 to 300. Originality/value: Based on developed methodology, the model of individualization of the educational process in an e-environment was created and implemented in the course of Informatics in Tallinn University of Technology. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Curricula; E-Learning; Teaching methods",,"Broadbent, B., (2002) ABCs of e-Learning: Reaping the Benefits and Avoiding the Pitfalls, , 1st ed., John Wiley & Sons, New York, NY; (2015) AP computer science principles, , https://advancesinap.collegeboard.org/stem/computer-science-principles, accessed, 4 May 2015; (2015) Computational thinking task force, , http://csta.acm.org/Curriculum/sub/CompThinking.html, accessed, 2 May 2015; (2015) ECDL foundation, , www.ecdl.com, accessed, 1 May 2015; Felder, R., Brent, R., Understanding students differences (2005) Journal of Engineering Education, 94 (1), pp. 57-72; Felder, R.M., Spurlin, J.E., Applications, reliability, and validity of the index of learning styles (2005) International Journal of Engineering Education, 21 (1), pp. 103-112; (2014) Project-based learning, , www.edutopia.org/project-based-learning, accessed, 24 November 2014; (2015) Khan academy, , www.khanacademy.org/, accessed, 3 May 2015; Kolb, D., (1984) Experimental Learning, , Prentice Hall, Engle Cliffs; (2015) Scratch – imagine, program, share, , http://scratch.mit.edu/, accessed, 6 May 2015; (2015) Open-source learning platform | Moodle.org, , https://moodle.org/, accessed, 6 May 2015; Palmer, S.R., The lived experience of flexible education – theory, policy and practice (2011) Journal of University Teaching & Learning Practice, 8 (3)",17415659,,,"English",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84982899283

Although this learning mode is not new in higher education, little research has been done to contextualise social presence experiences in which effects of interactions were explored for enhancing learning. A qualitative approach was adopted using the case study method to examine the instructor and students’ pedagogic interactions in the social presence of a blended synchronous learning environment. This paper reports an exploration of the blended learning with an online group of students at a remote site attending a computer-aided engineering drawing course synchronously with a face-to-face group taught by an instructor in a laboratory. The process of interaction was visually and verbally mediated by videoconference as if in an online face-to-face learning community. The findings show that the online and face-to-face groups had different social presence experiences in which interaction emerged. Emotional adaptation and practice is needed for the students and the instructor in such a complex environment. Based on the interaction patterns, a framework of interactions in the blended synchronous learning environment is conceptualised to inform course development and instructional design. Implications for further study are also discussed. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","blended synchronous learning; face-to-face teaching; interactions; online learning; social presence; virtual environment",,"Akyol, Z., Arbaugh, J.B., Cleveland-Innes, M., Garrison, D.R., Ice, P., Richardson, J.C., Swan, K., A response to the review of the community of inquiry framework (2009) Journal of Distance Education, 23 (2), pp. 123-136; Akyol, Z., Garrison, D.R., Understanding cognitive presence in an online and blended community of inquiry: Assessing outcomes and processes for deep approaches to learning (2011) British Journal of Educational Technology, 42 (2), pp. 233-250; Bassey, M., On the nature of research in education (part 2) (1990) Research Intelligence, 37 (Summer), pp. 39-44; Bianco, M.B., Carr-Chellman, A.A., Exploring qualitative methodologies in online learning environments (2007) Online learning community, pp. 299-317. , Luppicini R., (ed), Charlotte, NC: IAP; Bonk, C.J., Graham, C.R., (2006) The handbook of blended learning: Global perspectives, local designs, , San Francisco, CA: Jossey-Bass; Chen, N.-S., Ko, H.-C., Kinshuk, Lin, T., A model for synchronous learning using the Internet (2005) Innovations in Education and Teaching International, 42 (2), pp. 181-194; Cobb, S.C., Social presence and online learning: A current view from a research perspective (2009) Journal of Interactive Online Learning, 8 (3), pp. 241-254; Cohen, J., A coefficient of agreement for nominal scales (1960) Educational and Psychological Measurement, 20 (1), pp. 37-46; Garrison, D.R., Anderson, T., (2003) E-learning in the 21st century, , London: RoutedgeFalmer; Garrison, D.R., Anderson, T., Archer, W., Critical inquiry in a text-based environment: Computer conferencing in higher education (2000) The Internet and Higher Education, 2 (2-3), pp. 87-105; Garrison, D.R., Cleveland-Innes, M., Facilitating cognitive presence in online learning: Interaction is not enough (2005) The American Journal of Distance Education, 19 (3), pp. 133-148; Garrison, D.R., Vaughan, N.D., (2008) Blended learning in higher education: Framework, principles, and guidelines, , San Francisco, CA: Jossey-Bass; Gregori, E., Torras, E., Guasch, T., Cognitive attainment in online learning environments: Matching cognitive and technological presence (2012) Interactive Learning Environments, 20 (5), pp. 467-483; Gunawardena, C.N., Social presence theory and implications for interaction and collaborative learning in computer conferences (1995) International Journal of Education Telecommunications, 1 (2-3), pp. 147-166; Gunawardena, C.N., Zittle, F.J., Social presence as a predictor of satisfaction with a computer-mediated conferencing environment (1997) American Journal of Distance Education, 11, pp. 8-26; Hastie, M., Hung, I.-C., Chen, N.-S., Kinshuk, A blended synchronous learning model for educational international collaboration (2010) Innovations in Education and Teaching International, 47 (1), pp. 9-24; Kreijns, K., Kirschner, P.A., Jochems, W., Identifying the pitfalls for social interaction in computer-supported collaborative learning environments: A review of the research (2003) Computers in Human Behavior, 19 (3), pp. 335-353; Kreijns, K., Kirschner, P.A., Jochems, W., Measuring perceived social presence in distributed learning groups (2011) Education Information Technology, 16 (4), pp. 365-381; Lawson, T., Comber, C., Gage, J., Cullum-Hanshaw, A., Images of the future for education?

Dialogic learning was introduced to a unit of study taken by a final-year cohort of students in an initial teacher education degree at an urban university in Australia. Various opportunities for dialogue were designed into the unit through blended learning such as face-to-face tutorials, social networks and Viva Voce contexts. In the face of mixed opinion on their efficacy, the author profiles the use of social networks as a means of incorporating more interactive discourse through Web 2.0 platforms in higher education. The mixed-methods study reports on data collected from focus group interviews run at the end of the semester. An analytical framework based on Alexander’s principles of dialogic learning is used to interrogate the data set. The results illustrate the positive impact that dialogue employed as a pedagogic tool had on the value students perceived of their learning experience. It is recommended that designs for learning in higher education incorporate iterative exchanges across a variety of blended learning contexts to encourage productive interactions between students, peers and tutors. © 2015 Alyson Simpson.","blended learning; dialogic learning; higher education; pedagogy; social networks",,"Ahola, S., (2000) Hidden curriculum in higher education – Something to fear for or comply to?, , Paper presented at the Innovations in Higher Education conference, Helsinki, Finland:; Alexander, R., (2000) Culture and pedagogy: International comparisons of primary education, , London: Blackwell; Alexander, R., (2004) Towards dialogic teaching: Rethinking classroom talk, , 4th ed., Cambridge: Dialogos; Alexander, R., Towards a comparative pedagogy (2009) International handbook of comparative education, pp. 923-942. , Cowen R., Kazamias A.M., (eds), London: Springer; (2012) National professional standards for teachers and the initial teacher education standards and guidelines, , http://www.teacherstandards.aitsl.edu.au/OrganisationStandards/Organisation; Barnes, D., Why talk is important (2010) English Teaching: Practice and Critique, 9 (2), pp. 7-10; Barron, B., When smart groups fail (2003) Journal of the Learning Sciences, 12, pp. 307-359; Bell, F., The agency of students, teachers and learning technologists (2009) ALT-J, Research in Learning Technology, 17 (2), pp. 73-74; Christie, F., (2002) Classroom discourse analysis: A functional perspective, , London: Continuum; Deng, L., Yuen, A., Blogs in pre-service teacher education: Exploring the participation issue (2013) Technology, Pedagogy and Education, 22, pp. 339-356; Ellis, R.A., Calvo, R.A., Learning through discussions in blended environments (2004) Educational Media International, 41, pp. 263-274; Friesen, N., Lowe, S., The questionable promise of social media for education: Connective learning and the commercial imperative (2012) Journal of Computer Assisted Learning, 28, pp. 183-194; Hung, H., Yuen, S., Educational use of social networking technology in higher education (2010) Teaching in Higher Education, 15, pp. 703-714; Kirkwood, A., E-learning: You don't always get what you hope for (2009) Technology, Pedagogy and Education, 18, pp. 107-121; Kreijns, K., Kirschner, P., Jochems, W., Identifying the pitfalls for social interaction in computer-supported collaborative learning environments: A review of the research (2003) Computers in Human Behavior, 19, pp. 335-353; Larivee, B., Transforming teaching practice: Becoming the critically reflective teacher (2000) Reflective Practice, 1, pp. 293-307; Lave, J., Wenger, E., (1991) Situated learning: Legitimate peripheral participation, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Lemke, J.L., Critical analysis across media: Games, franchises, and the new cultural order (2005) Approaches to critical discourse analysis, , Postigo L., (ed), Valencia: University of Valencia, CD-ROM; Love, K., Simpson, A., Online discussions in schools: Towards a pedagogical framework (2006) International Journal of Educational Research, 43, pp. 446-463; Luke, A., Critical literacy in Australia: A matter of context and standpoint (2000) Journal of Adult and Adolescent Literacy, 43, pp. 448-461; Mercer, N., (1995) The guided construction of knowledge: Talk amongst teachers and learners, , Clevedon: Multilingual Matters; Mercer, N., (2000) Words and minds: How we use language to think together, , London: Routledge; Mercer, N., Sociocultural discourse analysis: Analysing classroom talk as a social mode of thinking (2004) Journal of Applied Linguistics, 1, pp. 137-168; Mercer, N., Littleton, K., Wegerif, R., Methods for studying the processes of interaction and collaborative activity in computer-based educational activities (2004) Technology, Pedagogy and Education, 13, pp. 195-212; Merriam, S.B., (2001) Qualitative research and case study applications in education, , San Francisco, CA: Jossey-Bass; Michell, M., Sharpe, T., Collective instructional scaffolding in English as a Second Language classrooms (2005) Prospect, 20, pp. 31-58; Noor Al-Deen, H., Hendricks, J., (2012) Social media usage and impact, , Plymouth: Lexington Books; Owen, M., Just a tool?

However, literature reviews show that many institutions mostly implement blended learning rather than evaluate the potential benefits. As blended learning continues to grow in popularity, so researchers must explore the potential and limitations of this field in depth. The aim of this paper is to present research results of effectiveness and efficiency of a hybrid learning and teaching model for developing leadership skills among graduate students. The authors focused on two important things. First, the authors investigated how to enhance benefits of blended learning for leadership training for working students and, second, the authors explored the drivers of blended learning for working students in order to achieve high quality teaching and learning experiences. Blended learning has been shown useful and beneficial when used to attract experienced teachers from abroad to university courses when they cannot come for the whole semester. Therefore, the paper analyzes theoretical aspects of employing a blended model to teach degree level as well as executive level studies in a university context, and the applicability of this model in the context of leadership courses. In order to empirically test how efficient and effective the hybrid model is for teaching and learning leadership, a qualitative case study research strategy was chosen. This strategy allowed interpretive, contextual, and authentic evaluations instead of objective, non-contextual, and inauthentic evaluations. The research results are based on the case study of recently developed leadership studies course at one Lithuanian university. During the research, it was found that blended learning provides powerful and efficient methods for course participants, however, several things need refinement. In particular, some aspects of learning design, learning material and modifications at organizational level. © The Authors, 2016.","Blended learning; Collaboration; E-learning; Effectiveness; Efficiency; Leadership studies","Education; Education computing; Efficiency; Personnel training; Students; Teaching; Blended learning; Collaboration; Effectiveness; Effectiveness and efficiencies; Institutions of higher educations; Leadership studies; Qualitative case studies; Teaching and learning; E-learning","(2016) The Blended Learning Toolkit, , https://blended.online.ucf.edu/; Archee, R., Is Blended Learning Making Us Stupid, Too?

The Malaysian Ministry of Higher Education, in the National Graduate Employability Blueprint 2012-2017, also highlighted the issue of graduates' inability to solve problems as a key factor affecting graduate employability (Ministry of Higher Education, 2012). Therefore, this study presents a blended learning environment designed with Authentic Learning strategies outlined by Herrington and Kervin (2007) as a framework to facilitate problem-solving skills among learners. The learning environment also centred on an authentic problem-based group project that students worked collaboratively to solve as part of the learning experience throughout the trimester. The group project was designed to reflect real-world cases, which would allow students to experience an authentic learning process as they take on different roles and responsibilities throughout the completion of the project. Learning was further facilitated through in-class discussions, consultations with the lecturer, by accessing learning materials that were available online 24/7, collaborating via web tools and documenting their learning process using blogs. Results show a positive response from students towards the authentic blended learning environment. Students found the group project relevant and were more engaged in their learning. The learning environment was found to encourage the acquisition of transferrable knowledge and skills, made learning a more active process, and enhanced understanding. Results therefore provide support for the design and development of learning environments that are authentic and blended as an approach to cultivate graduates with the problem solving skills they need to increase their employability.","Authentic learning; Blended learning; Problem solving; Web tools","Computer aided instruction; E-learning; Education; Learning systems; Students; Authentic learning; Blended learning; Blended learning environments; Design and Development; Learning environments; Learning experiences; Problem solving skills; Web tools; Problem solving","Abdullah, H.R., PMR and UPSR exams may go (2010) The Star, , http://www.thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2010/6/21/nation/6510666, 21 June 2010, [28 June 2015]; Awang, Z., Mohamed, R., Imperative attributes for graduate employability in manufacturing firms: Issues for internationalising Malaysia's curricula (2008) Globalization and Internationalisation of Higher Education in Malaysia, p. 248. , Sarjit Kaur, Morshidi Sirat and Norzaini Azman (ed.) , Pulau Pinang: Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia; Barrie, S.C., A research-based approach to generic graduate attributes policy (2004) Higher Education Research & Development, 23 (3), pp. 261-275; Bonk, C.J., Graham, C.R., (2012) The Handbook of Blended Learning: Global Perspectives, Local Designs, , John Wiley & Sons; Chipman, S.F., Segal, J.W., Glaser, R., (2013) Thinking and Learning Skills: Volume 2: Research and Open Questions, , Routledge; Conole, G., Designing for learning in an open world (2012) Springer Science & Business Media, 4; Graduates among 400,000 currently unemployed in Malaysia, says minister (2015) The Malaysian Insider, , http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/graduates-among-400000-currentlyunemployed-in-malaysia-says-minister, (12 May), [Online] , [23 December 2015]; Hanapi, Z., Nordin, M.S., Unemployment among Malaysia graduates: Graduates' attributes, lecturers' competency and quality of education (2014) Procedia-Social and Behavioral Sciences, 112, pp. 1056-1063; Herrington, J., Kervin, L., Authentic learning supported by technology: 10 suggestions and cases of integration in classrooms (2007) Educational Media International, 44 (3), pp. 219-236; Herrington, J., Reeves, T., Oliver, R., (2010) A Guide to Authentic Elearning, , New York: Routledge; Jonassen, D.H., (2011) Learning to Solve Problems, , New York: Routledge; Khalid, M., Yusof, R., Heng, C.T., Yunus, M.R.M., Virtual laboratory as an effective e-learning tool (2006) B3-E-Learning, Euro Southeast Asia 2006, , paper presented at the, Singapore; Kim, M.C., Hannafin, M.J., Scaffolding problem solving in technology-enhanced learning environments (TELEs): Bridging research and theory with practice (2011) Computers & Education, 56 (2), pp. 403-417; Lim, C.P., Khine, M.S., Hew, T., Wong, P., Shanti, D., Lim, B., Exploring critical aspects of information technologies integration in Singapore schools (2003) Australian Journal of Educational Technology (AJET), 19 (1), pp. 1-24; Lindsay, N., Wood, D., Facilitating creative problem solving in the entrepreneurship curriculum through authentic learning activities (2014) Activity Theory, Authentic Learning and Emerging Technologies: Towards A Transformative Higher Education Pedagogy, pp. 92-101. , Bozalek, V., Ng'ambi, D., Wood, D., Herrington, J., Hardman, J., Amory, A.

The e-courses vary in their structure, assignments, prompt examinations, interaction between students and teachers, etc. Such aspects may influence the students’ perception of usefulness of blended learning. The purpose of this paper is to identify the factors which influence that feeling and to look for possible differences in perception by different subgroups of students. Design/methodology/approach: Students in the survey evaluated 13 aspects of e-courses in which they were enrolled. From enrolment documents, additional demographic data were collected (gender, high-school grade, study programme, etc.). A multiple linear regression was used with perceived usefulness as the response variable and the 12 other e-course aspects as predictors. Further, the same regression analysis was performed on different subgroups of students based on demographical data. Findings: The empirical results showed that the general impression regarding the e-courses, their consistency with the face-to-face teaching and the teachers’ responsiveness had a significant influence on the students’ perception of the usefulness of e-courses. Further analysis based on demographic data revealed several subgroups of students where the perception of usefulness was influenced by different aspects. The teachers’ feedback and supplementing the tutorial play an important role in higher years of study, while the general impression loses its influence. Originality/value: The paper is the first to explore the importance of demographic determinants of perceived usefulness of e-learning tools in EAPAA (European Association of Public Administration Accreditation)-accredited undergraduate public administration programmes. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Blended learning; Higher education; Moodle LMS; Public administration education; Questionnaire analysis; Students’ perceived usefulness",,"Al-Adwan, A., Al-Adwan, A., Smedley, J., Exploring students’ acceptance of e-learning using technology acceptance model in Jordanian universities (2013) International Journal of Education and Development using Information and Communication Technology, 9 (2), pp. 4-18; Alexander, S., Golja, T., Using students’ experiences to derive quality in an e-learning system: an institution’s perspective (2007) Educational Technology & Society, 10 (2), pp. 17-33; Batagelj, V., Mrvar, A., (2016) Pajek: analysis and visualization of large networks, , http://mrvar.fdv.uni-lj.si/pajek/; Carvalho, A., Areal, N., Silva, J., Students’ perceptions of Blackboard and Moodle in a Portuguese university (2011) British Journal of Educational Technology, 42 (5), pp. 824-841; Dečman, M., Modeling the acceptance of e-learning in mandatory environments of higher education: the influence of previous education and gender (2015) Computers in Human Behavior, 49, pp. 272-281; Elkaseh, A.M., Wong, K.W., Fung, C.C., Perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness of social media for e-learning in Libyan Higher Education: a structural equation modeling analysis (2016) International Journal of Information and Education Technology, 6 (3), pp. 192-199; Ellis, R.A., Ginns, P., Piggot, L., E-learning in higher education: some key aspects and their relationship to approaches to study (2009) Higher Education Research & Development, 28 (3), pp. 303-318; Fructerman, T.M., Reingold, E.M., Graph drawing by force-directed placement (1991) Software: Practice and Experience, 21 (11), pp. 1129-1164; Hall, C., (2006) Lighting a fire or filling a pail?

First, the importance of a flexible, curriculum-based approach to BL is examined, based on a review of the literature. Experimentation with blended English language courses for part-time students began in 2002 and in 2005 the open-source learning platform, Moodle, was adopted due to the interactive tools available, making it possible to create learner-centered activities based on a collaborative approach. A description is given of the role BL has played in adult professional training at the university and how it provides a flexible solution for meeting the needs of degree course programs for students. With a view toward good practice, a detailed description of a currently offered blended course is given, including comparative data of the same course taught traditionally in the classroom with results indicating student performance for both courses during the period of an academic year. Moreover, a range of competencies is necessary to prepare students for the workplace, such as providing them with skills in intercultural communication and digital literacies, which can be indirect benefits from the adoption of a blended methodology. The study concludes with reflections for the future. © 2016, Italian e-Learning Association.

To conduct a quantitative comparison of the contents of all notes for effective instruction from lecturer to students to occur, the contents were mathematically compared and evaluated using two ways of summarizing the frequency of term co-occurrences. In order to evaluate visually the differences between the contents of notes taken, an adjacency matrix and Levenshtein distance metrics were employed to represent noun co-occurrence in the notes. In comparing notes between the lecturer and students, insufficient distance and additional distance are defined and measured for all participants during the course. In the results, students recorded additional nouns to replace the nouns given by the lecturer, and introduced new nouns of their own as substitutes as well. There are significant correlation relationships between the above mentioned distances and the ratios, such as between the word ratio and coverage, which have been defined in previous studies. Also, summarizing ways of co-occurrence frequency did not affect any of the relationships. Finally, possible applications for visualizing learning activities of the lecturer and students are discussed. © 2016, IGI Global.","Adjacency matrix; Blended learning; Distance; Note assessment; Term co-occurrence","Computer aided instruction; Education; Students; Teaching; Adjacency matrices; Blended learning; Distance; Note assessment; Term co-occurrence; Quality control","IGraph: Network analysis and visualization, , http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/igraph/index.html, iGraph [online] Available; Jackson, P., Moulinier, I., (2002) Natural Language Processing for Online Applications -Text Retrieval, Extraction and Categorization, , Amsterdam, Netherlands: John Benjamins Publishing; Jin, M., (2009) Tekisuto Deta No Tokei Kagaku Nyumon, , Tokyo, Japan: Iwanami Shoten; Kiewra, K.A., Students' note-taking behaviors and the efficacy of providing the instructor's notes for review (1985) Contemporary Educational Psychology, 10 (4), pp. 378-386; Kiewra, K.A., A review of note-taking: The encoding-storage paradigm and beyond (1989) Educational Psychology Review, 1 (2), pp. 147-172; Kiewra, K.A., Benton, S.L., Kim, S.-I., Risch, N., Christensen, M., Effects of note-taking format and study technique on recall and relational performance (1995) Contemporary Educational Psychology, 20 (2), pp. 172-187; Kobayashi, K., What limits the encoding effect of note-taking?

The framework also identified key strategy, structure, and support issues universities may address at each stage. In this paper, the authors applied that framework as well as Rogers' (2003) diffusion of innovations theory to determine the degree to which institutional strategy, structure, and support measures facilitate or impede BL adoption among higher education faculty. In addition, the authors explored whether higher education faculty's innovation adoption category affects which measures facilitate or impede BL adoption. To achieve these objectives, the authors surveyed 214 faculty and interviewed 39 faculty at a school in the adoption/early implementation stage of BL adoption. The authors published the survey results in a prior article.

To gain knowledge about the ways in which the tutors experienced the phenomenon, a phenomenographic methodological framework was employed. Identified were four different ways of conceiving the online course as: A) a one-way street of communication: to provide students with extra materials to practice individually and for asynchronous communication, B) an add-on to on-campus classes; C) a distant relationship between students and online tutors; and D) an opportunity for tutor's professional development and team communication. The phenomenographic approach allowed to reveal variations of tutors' perceptions of teaching online with a view of enhancing the university curriculum. The findings may have implications for university teachers and educational designers.

The model development is based on survey data collected from representative teachers and students studying in higher education institutions in Turkey. To develop the model, the study investigated the attitudes of the representative key stakeholders in the relevant higher education institutions towards e-learning by administrating questionnaires and interviews with teachers and students. The responses of the teachers and students were then compared. Based on the results, a model was proposed with a multidimensional approach to e-learning. The model ips electrical engineering to make sure that the students review, discuss, and explore course content before and after class. The proposed model encourages students to start with e-learning, to continue with the face-to-face learning setting on campus, and then to come back to e- learning for evaluating their learning in the classroom. Using this model, students can study at home and assess their learning before and after their attendance to campus lectures and enhance their learning with various types of learning, namely self-directed learning, self-assessment, teacher-directed learning, teacher assessment, computer-directed learning, and computer assessment. Similarly, model evaluation was conducted at the relevant higher education institutions. To evaluate the applicability of the model, a case-control study was conducted to determine whether the model had the intended effect on the participating students of the relevant institutions. As a result of the case-control study, the effects of e-learning, blended learning, and traditional learning were verified by teaching the use of MATLAB software. The overall scores indicated that e-learning and blended learning were more effective as compared to traditional learning. The results of our study indicated that the knowledge increase in e-learners seemed to be gradual because they tended to study daily by completing each activity on time. © 2016 TÜBİTAK.","E-learning; E-learning readiness; Educational game; Electricity; Higher education","Curricula; E-learning; Education; Education computing; Electricity; MATLAB; Societies and institutions; Students; Surveys; Teaching; E-learning readiness; Educational game; Face-to-face learning; Higher education; Higher education institutions; Multi-dimensional approach; Self-directed learning; Traditional learning; Engineering education","Martín-Rodríguez, O., Fernández-Molina, J.S., Montero-Alonso, M.A., González-Gómez, F., The main components of satisfaction with e-learning (2014) J Technol Pedagog Educ, 23, pp. 1-11; Laurillard, D., Technology, pedagogy and education: Concluding comments (2007) J Technol Pedagog Educ, 16, pp. 357-360; Hughes, G., Using blended learning to increase learner support and improve retention (2007) J Teac High Educ, 12, pp. 349-363; Zappe, S., Leicht, R., Messner, J., Litzinger, T., Lee, H.W., 'Flipping' the classroom to explore active learning in a large undergraduate course (2009) ASEE 2009 American Society for Engineering Education Annual Conference & Exhibition, pp. 1-21. , 14-17 June; Austin, Texas, USA; Lage, J.M., Platt, J.G., Treglia, M., Inverting the classroom: A gateway to creating an inclusive learning environment (2000) J Econ Educ, 31, pp. 30-43; Akaslan, D., Law, E.L.C., Measuring teachers' readiness for e-learning in higher education institutions associated with the subject of electricity in Turkey (2011) IEEE 2011 Global Engineering Education Conference, pp. 481-490. , 4-6 April; Amman, Jordan.

It examines the effectiveness of the application of interactive and collaborative resources to improve reading and writing in English. Based on the overall evaluation of the blended course, most students believe that online glossary, online questionnaire, wiki and forum are good tools to improve their written skills. They are strongly aware of the necessity of improving these skills, and consider that the activities designed through these technological tools have allowed them to foster effective written communication in a variety of situations. Students also emphasize the potential of collaborative tools to communicate and develop collaborative learning. However, some students consider that there is a lack of privacy and fluency in communication, and believe that interactions are impersonal and disorganized, so they have had problems to do the activities and communicate suitably.","Adult Learning; Blended Learning; Collaborative Learning; Hypermedia Modular Model; Second Language; Written Skills",,"Arnal, J., Rinco, D., Latorre, A., (1994) Investigación Educativa.

This vision encompassed far more than just societal and economic growth in a global world; it also included educational strategies and an e-learning action plan. For example, in 2011, the European Commission mentioned the following as a key policy issue (Communication 2011): to ""better exploit the potential of ICTs to enable more effective and personalised learning experiences, teaching and research methods (e.g. [sic] eLearning and blended learning) and increase the use of virtual learning platforms."" In accordance with this roadmap, higher education institutions are called on to reflect and re-engineer their educational systems, adapt them to current and future technological and didactical demands and address new generations of teachers and students. New concepts like connectivism (Siemens 2004) and the recognition of non-formal and informal learning (OECD 2016) enhance traditional formal learning settings and lead far beyond the provision of mere learning content management systems. New e-learning and blended learning arrangements like MOOCs (Cormier & Siemens 2010), collaborative learning in the virtual classroom (Tawileh, Bukvova & Schoop 2013) and flipped classroom approaches (Hussey, Fleck & Richmond 2014) are evolving and must be explored, evaluated and then strategically implemented into everyday teaching and learning processes. A comprehensive e-learning strategy should therefore address four fields: didactics, technology, organisation and economy and culture (Seufert & Euler 2004). Besides orientation on the actual trends, the strategy development should also recognise and integrate practical local experiences of early adopters and actors of e-learning in the field. Therefore, a community of knowledge experts in e-learning application has been involved in the strategy development. Design/methodology/approach - Best practice report of a comprehensive quality initiative for the sustainable improvement of everyday teaching and learning processes at a large university. The challenges of current and future trends in formal and informal learning, collaboration in virtual classrooms and internationalisation of research and teaching processes are analysed and addressed by the strategy implementation plan and a regular evaluation and improvement concept is presented and discussed. Originality/value - The e-learning strategy presented was developed, discussed and adopted in 2015. Its implementation plan is currently at the final discussion stage, having been due for adoption in January 2016. Practical implications - The e-learning strategy's implementation plan lists targets and sub-targets, underlined by concrete measures, tools and methods, responsible institutions and persons and financial sources. Regular evaluations and improvements will give elearning providers a set of proven instruments to further improve their activities and provide the broad range of students and teachers with a set of best practices to follow, enabling them to discover the benefits of e-learning for their everyday processes. © 2016 TUD press.","Dissemination; e-learning; Higher education; Implementation; Strategy",,"(2014) Arbeitskreis E-Learning der Landesrektorenkonferenz Sachsen.

Design/methodology/approach: To support teaching with technology at the Cape Peninsula University of Technology (CPUT), a pilot project was conducted in 2014 using tablet technology to train IL to a group of 20 ECP Environmental Management students in the Applied Sciences Faculty. All modules were adapted for this purpose meaning that students used the tablet throughout the training sessions. Findings: Good collaboration between librarians and faculty, as well as interaction between students increased. Some of the challenges faced were unstable internet connection; many Web applications identified by the trainers to use during the training were not compatible with the Nexus 7 Tablet. Overall, the training went well. In the end, the librarians were successful in achieving learning to take place among students. Originality/value: Currently CPUT Libraries promotes the Information Literacy (IL) Certificate Programme to first year students, integrating IL into the curriculum of faculty. It is hoped that this paper will give insight for academic librarians wishing to incorporate mobile technologies into their IL training programmes. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Blended learning; e-learning; Information literacy; Online learning environment; Student experience; Tablet technology",,"Aharony, N., Librarians’ attitudes towards mobile services (2013) Aslib Proceedings, 65 (4), pp. 358-375; Anderson, K., May, F., Does the method of instruction matter?

Computer science has a tradition of face-to-face programming huts where students taking programming courses can explore important programming concepts with instant feedback from human facilitators. In contemporary blended learning where more and more of teaching and learning sessions are given by distance there is a need for online alternatives for self-learning. At the department where this study was conducted about half of the students fail to complete their introductory programming courses and many other universities face the same problem. Without facilitation, online or face-to-face, and appropriate alternatives for self-learning the fail rates would be even higher. The N-generation or the Digital Natives that now are entering university programmes are the first generation that has used computers, Internet and online systems since early childhood. Their digital prerequisites are better than earlier generations but at the same time they have higher demands for interaction in online environments. In this study two different online learning environments for self-learning were analysed and discussed to find answers to: ""What are the most important factors in the design of virtual learning environments for self-learning of fundamental programming skills and knowledge?"" The overall research strategy is the case study approach where students' attitudes on the use of online learning systems have been investigated in two programming courses. Data has been collected by interviews, evaluation questionnaires and group discussions. The explored online learning environments in this study are Pearson educations' MyProgrammingLab and Codecademy. Findings indicate that online systems have to be carefully designed if they should attract the digital natives generation. Some important design factors for self-learning systems found in this study are: unambiguous exercises, clear and well-formulated feedback, user-friendliness, GUI design, multi-modality, gamification and curriculum alignment. Interesting extension of user-friendliness is if the programming exercises have multi-lingual descriptions and if the online systems might be adapted for students with different learning styles. © The Authors, 2016.","Codecademy; Myprogramminglab; Online learning systems; Programming education; Self-learning","Computer aided instruction; Computer programming; Curricula; Education; Learning systems; Online systems; Students; Surveys; Teaching; Codecademy; Myprogramminglab; On-line learning systems; Programming education; Self-learning; E-learning","Allwood, J., Multimodal corpora (2008) Corpus linguistics: An international handbook, 1, pp. 207-224; Ball, J., (2010) Enhancing learning of children from diverse language backgrounds: Mother tongue-based bilingual or multilingual education in early childhood and early primary school years, , Victoria, Canada: Early Childhood Development Intercultural Partnerships, University of Victoria; Boistrup, L.B., Selander, S., COORDINATING MULTIMODAL SOCIAL SEMIOTICS AND AN INSTITUTIONAL PERSPECTIVE IN STUDYING ASSESSMENT ACTIONS IN MATHEMATICS CLASSROOMS, p. 1565. , CERME 6-WORKING GROUP 9; Brekke, M., Early Testing of e-Exams in Calculus at University Level (2013) EDEN 2013 Annual Conference, pp. 625-632. , University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway, 12-15 June 2013.

It seems that Wikis form a ""promising"" environment in Secondary Education and particularly in the obligator course of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) course. While the concept of Wikis is part of the curriculum in ICT courses in high school (gymnasium), it can also be used as a complementary e-tool which supports the class teacher/facilitator. Here is an implementation of a ""blended"" strategy combining face-to-face learning with web-based and distance learning. As of 2011, the ICT course is an obligatory, two hour course each week in Greek Pilot Gymnasium curricula among experimental schools and is mainly a project-based. This course focuses on, ""ICT literacy,"" which describes the students' ability to solve problems and participate in our society of modern knowledge with the use of digital technologies, to use communication tools and network services for access, management, embedding, evaluation and information communication. Our rearch focuses on the exploitation of Wikis in the ICT course. During the last three years, Wikis are used in the context of ICT course in the Experimental School of Aristotle University, Thessaloniki, Greece. Students of 13-15 years old participate in the Wiki of the class with their personal account and share material, collaborate, discuss, communicate with classmates and teacher. The ICT course is based on four issues: a) ICT as a scientific technological tool, b) ICT as a cognitive tool, c) ICT as a method to solve problems and d) ICT as a social phenomenon. Our empirical research has been implemented through observations, questionnaires and interviews in order to triangulate our results. The results have showed that Wikis give students the opportunities to develop skills and abilities related to ICT course curriculum and teacher's ""blended"" strategy engages them in their learning process. Since teaching of ICT literacy in high school is a clear laboratory educational process, each student's active participation can be considered as feasible. Interaction and collaboration between students, teachers and educational material are continually ecouraged. The Wiki of the class and the school computer-laboratory are the places where students can study, research, actively participate and collaborate in such a way that the exploratory and research approach of knowledge, interactive and collaborative learning and creativity are favoured and encouraged. © The Authors, 2016.","Blended learning; Collaborative learning; ICT course; Interaction; Secondary education; Wiki","Curricula; Distance education; E-learning; Education; Engineering education; Gymnasiums; Information management; Students; Surveys; Blended learning; Collaborative learning; ICT course; Interaction; Wiki; Teaching","Alyousef, H.S., Picard, M.Y., Cooperative or collaborative literacy practices: Mapping metadiscourse in a business students' Wiki group project (2011) Australasian Journal of Educational Technology, 27, pp. 463-480; Anderson, K.M., Tips for teaching: Differentiating instruction to include all students (2007) Preventing School Failure, 51 (3), pp. 49-54; Chu, S.K.W., Tavares, N.J., Chu, D., Yee, H.S., Chow, K., Siu, F., Wong, M., (2012) Developing upper primary students' 21 century skills: inquiry learning through collaborative teaching and Web 2.0 technology, , Hong Kong: Centre for Information Technology in Education, Faculty of Education, The University of Hong Kong; Cohen, L., Manion, L., (1994) Research Methods in Education, , 4th Ed.

A major constraint in providing high quality laboratory resources in some universities and in economically challenged countries is high costs, training personnel, training time and maintenance-related issues. Virtual and remote labs complement the real laboratory resources with virtually defined techniques including simulations, animations, remote triggering of the actual equipment and videos that facilitate user interactions. Our goal was to analyze the effectiveness of biotechnology virtual labs in integrating learning process among school and university students of ages 12-15 years and 17-24 years respectively within India. These labs were developed as part of a National mission on Education through ICT. We also focused on the use of virtual and remote labs as a new pedagogy for distance and mobile learning courses and the context of usage outside scheduled classroom timings. The evaluation of biotechnology virtual labs was performed via surveys, including online and manual feedback reports for analyzing the learning process of various student groups. Studies amongst students of different age groups suggested that virtualization helped their active learning in a traditional classroom scenario. Feedback from student users also indicated virtual and remote labs aided, mobile learning by improving their academic performance, after using virtual and remote labs (post usage) as education platform. Feedback statistics showed 90% of students used biotechnology virtual lab techniques and that helped them to get an actual feel of the experiment. All participants scored more than 70% in the post-test, improving the class average from the pre-test scenario. 91% of teachers who participated in the workshops indicated that they could use virtual and remote labs in their daily teaching process as teaching material thereby reducing their lecture preparation time. Feedback analysis also indicated improved student performance enhancing laboratory education. © 2015 IEEE.","Biotechnology; Education; Mobile and distance learning; Remote labs; Virtual labs","Artificial intelligence; Biotechnology; E-learning; Education; Engineering education; Laboratories; Learning systems; Mobile telecommunication systems; Personnel training; Students; Teaching; Academic performance; Computer technology; Internet connectivity; Laboratory education; Remote labs; University education; Virtual and remote labs; Virtual lab; Distance education","Nair, B., Krishnan, R., Nizar, N., Radhamani, R., Rajan, K., Yoosef, A., Sujatha, G., Diwakar, S., Role of ict-enabled visualization-oriented virtual laboratories in universities for enhancing biotechnology education -value initiative: Case study and impacts (2012) Forma Mente; Nedic, Z., Machotka, J., Nafalski, A., Remote laboratory netlab for effective interaction with real equipment over the internet (2008) 2008 Conference on Human System Interaction, HSI 2008, pp. 846-851; Radhamani, R., Sasidharakurup, H., Sujatha, G., Nair, B., Achuthan, K., Diwakar, S., Virtual labs improve student ' s performance in a classroom (2014) 1st International Conference on e-Learning e-Education and Online Training; Raman, R., Achuthan, K., Nedungadi, P., Diwakar, S., Bose, R., The vlab oer experience: Modeling potential-Adopter student acceptance (2014) IEEE Transactions on Education; Bijlani, K., Shivsubramani, K., Venkat, R., Ranga, V., A-view : Context-Aware mobile e-learning mobile technologies in developing nations -A potential (2012) Mobile Wireless Middleware, Operating Systems, and Applications, pp. 1-14; Mitra, S., Dangwal, R., Limits to self-organising systems of learning -The kalikuppam experiment (2010) Br.

For this reason, a new approach has been considered in Aerospace Engineering at Technical University of Valencia (UPV) which, in addition to master classes, includes assignments specially designed to achieve mathematical competencies in the first year. These assignments reinforce the learning process of students and increase their competencies before each assessment test. On the other hand PoliformaT, an educational platform developed by UPV, and based on the Sakai project, has facilitated to develop a flipped teaching methodology in the one hour lab sessions in the first year of Aerospace Engineering. Thus a blended learning methodology, a combination of computer technologies and face-to-face classes, has provided very good learning outcomes results for Spanish standards. We present some results concerning our first year Mathematics course in Aerospace Engineering and the opinion of the students about this blended learning methodology. © 2015 IEEE.","Assessment and Evaluation Strategies/Approaches Laboratory Experiences; Blended learning; First and Second Year Program; Mathematics in Engineering Education; Teaching & Learning Experiences in Engineering Education","Aerospace engineering; Learning systems; Students; Blended learning; Digital technologies; Educational platforms; First and Second Year Program; Laboratory experiences; Learning experiences; Teaching methodologies; Technical universities; Engineering education","Croisier, D., Purser, L., Smidt, H., Trends V: Universities shaping the european higher education area (2007) EUA Report; Edwards, M., Sánchez Ruiz, L.M., Sánchez Díaz, C., Achieving competence-based curriculum in engineering education in Spain (2009) Proceedings of the IEEE, 97 (10), pp. 1727-1736; (2015), http://www.upv.es/titulaciones/GIA/menu_812584i.html, Bachelor's Degree in Aerospace Engineering, Last accessed March; (2015), https://www.sakaiproject.org, Sakai, Last Accessed March; (2015), http://turnitin.com/es, Turnintin, Last Accessed 15 March; Bergmann, J., Sams, A., Before you flip, consider this (2012) Phi Delta Kappan, 94 (2), p. 25; Bergmann, J., Overmyer, J., Wilie, B., The flipped class: What it is and what it is not (2015) The Daily Riff, , http://www.thedailyriff.com/articles/the-flipped-class-conversation-689.php, July 2013. , Last accessed 13 March; Kim, M.K., Kim, S.M., Khera, O., Getman, J., The experience of three flipped classrooms in an urban university: An exploration of design principles (2014) Internet and Higher Education, 22, pp. 37-50; Hughes, H., Introduction to flipping the college classroom Proceedings of World Conference on Educational Multimedia, Hypermedia and Telecommunications, pp. 2434-2438. , Chesapeake, April 2012; 7 things you need to know about flipping the classroom (2015) A White Paper from Information Technology Services at Penn State, , http://newfacultysupport.csulb.wikispaces.net/file/view/2011-Flippingthe-Classroom.pdf, The Pennsylvania State University, Last Accessed 15 March; Roselló, M.D., Transformación de Joukowski, , http://riunet.upv.es/handle/10251/16813, Last Accessed 15 March 2015; Moraño, J.A., (2015) Gráficas 2D.

They are reflections of the progressive change in higher education over the last few decades towards more student-and learning centred pedagogies and practices, which are made possible through new technologies and more delivery of online and blended (combination of face-to-face and online components) courses. The increasing personalising and flexibility of learning in higher education requires equal attention spent to assessment practices to ensure a cohesive learning experience. This paper provides the findings and conclusions of a study about a flipped classroom, which also included flexible assessment components. The study showed that students enjoy and are more engaged in a flipped classroom, prefer a blended learning to a fully online learning approach, want and require clear structure and guidelines, and strongly value flexible assessment through more choices and control. The main concern of higher education teachers is the time commitment and lack of institutional support for flipping classrooms and providing flexible assessment. It is argued that personalising learning requires more personalising of assessment, and that it is mainly the responsibility of teachers and institutions to develop 'flexible students'. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Flexible assessment; Flexible learning; Flipped classroom; Higher education; Personalised learning","E-learning; Education; Social networking (online); Students; Flexible assessments; Flexible Learning; Flipped classroom; Higher education; Personalised learning; Teaching","Allen, I.E., Seaman, J., (2013) Changing Course: Ten Years of Tracking Online Education in the United States, , http://sloanconsortium.org/publications/survey/changing_course_2012, Accessed 12.02.14; Biggs, J., (2003) Teaching for Quality Learning at University, , 2nd ed.

Generally speaking, there are always pros and cons when elearning is considered. Students have access to all teaching materials, tasks and direct communication with the teacher at all times. On the other hand, if there are problems, it is hard for the teacher to distinguish the exact cause. Students may encounter problems in understanding the materials or in the use of instruments and computer applications; without direct contact, it is virtually impossible for the teacher to motivate them to continue working despite the difficulties. Another challenge for the teacher is detecting which parts of the subject are most interesting to the students and which parts demand more attention and maybe different methodologies. Using blended learning, combining the advantages of both e-learning and person to person teaching / learning, it is possible to achieve a better effect for the mutual benefit.

Mining of LMS users' data, involving artificial intelligence and incertitude modeling, e.g., via fuzzy logic, is a fundamental challenge. This study addresses the hypothesis that the structural characteristics of a Fuzzy Cognitive Map (FCM) can efficiently model the way LMS users interact with it, by estimating their Quality of Interaction (QoI) within a b-learning context. This study introduces the FCM-QoI model (combined with a model visualizer) consisting of 14 input-one output concepts, dependences and trends, considering one academic year of the LMS use from 75 professors and 1037 students at a HEI. The experimental findings have shown that the proposed FCM-QoI model can provide concepts interconnection and causal dependencies representation of Moodle LMS users' QoI, revealing perspectives of its evolution both at a micro and macro analysis level. Moreover, the FCM-QoI model significantly adds to the evaluation and analysis of the QoI influential concepts' contribution to self-sustained cycles (static analysis) and their alterations, when the time period of the LMS use is considered (dynamic analysis), showing potential to increase the flexibility and adaptivity of the QoI modeling and feedback approaches. Clearly, based on the FCM-QoI model, pedagogical instructors and decision-makers of HEIs could be assisted to holistically visualize, understand and assess OLEs stakeholders' needs within the teaching and learning practices. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Despite the existing benefits of using e-learning, some higher education institutions have not utilized e-learning to its full potential and yet there are limited studies that offer a comprehensive framework for effectively using e-learning systems. It is therefore imperative that learning technologists understand the factors that influence the effectiveness of blended e-learning. An expert survey was conducted to establish which factors are important for evaluating the effectiveness of e-learning systems.

Started in 2008 and gathering momentum over the past two years, now an online phenomenon, MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses) reunite different perspectives over a globalized online learning. The paper analyses the use of OER and MOOCs in different study cases in Romanian universities. Several OER initiatives resulted from the over 1000 academia involved in the DidaTec lifelong learning and training for higher education teachers in the technical sciences and engineering field as a training course for university professors in 12 universities, within the aim of improving the use of ICT in higher education. Four universities from Romania started a Romanian MOOC environment, the UniCampus, which provides free access to valuable education in Romanian language, presented by well-known professors. The evaluation and quality assurance challenges of the Unicampus are mainly due to the restrictive educational setting in Romania. Two study cases on blending MOOCs in traditional higher education courses at undergraduate and Master level are also analysed from the impact on students' motivation. Integrating MOOCs in blended learning empower students with new abilities and requires a new and open teacher model. © 2014 IEEE.","Higher Education; LMS; MOOCs; OER","Blending; Education computing; Personnel training; Quality assurance; Students; Teaching; Educational settings; Engineering fields; Higher education; Life long learning; Massive open online course; MOOCs; Open educational resources; Romanian universities; E-learning","Tuomi, I., Open educational resources and the transformation of education (2013) European Journal of Education, 48 (1), pp. 58-78; Siemens, G., Connectivism: A learning theory for the digital age (2005) International Journal of Instructional Technology and Distance Learning, 2 (1), pp. 3-10; (2013), http://ocw.mit.edu/ans7870/global/05_Prog_Eval_Report_Final.pdf, MITOCW Evaluation Report, MIT; McAuley, A., Stewart, B., Siemens, G., Cormier, D., (2010) The MOOC Model for Digital Practice., , https://oerknowledgecloud.org/sites/oerknowledgecloud.org/files/MOOC_Final_0.pdf; Bean, M., (2013) Interview for FutureLearn, , http://about.futurelearn.com/feature/interview-withmartin-bean-vice-chancellor-open-university/, (accessed 15 May 2014); UNESCO, (2002) Forum on the Impact of Open Courseware for Higher Education in Developing Countries-Final Report, , http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0012/001285/128515e.pdf; Conole, G., (2012) Designing for Learning in An Open World., 4. , Springer; Holotescu, C., Grosseck, G., Cretu, V., Danciu, E., The power of the three words and one acronym: OER vs OER.

The focus of the project is on the practice of blended learning using the dialogic shamrock framework which combines the concepts of learner centric, socio cultural and dialogic perspectives on collaborative learning and technology, in meeting the needs of learners in the 21st Century. In this context blended learning is defined as the use of technology to supplement campus based learning with a view to enhancing the learning and teaching experience. The methodologies implemented by the facilitator during a series of workshops to enable teachers to lead and embed change for the successful adoption of blended learning solutions in collaborative learning is presented with a discussion of the effectiveness of these methodologies. Teachers were invited to attend a presentation and participate in one of a series of workshops. Participants at the workshop were from different disciplines from across UABC and teachers from local institutions with experience of a range of technological and pedagogical practices and school cultures. Examples of blended learning solutions using the dialogic shamrock framework were presented to the teachers. They were invited to work in interdisciplinary groups during the workshop and to design a blended learning solution to support collaborative learning for implementation within their own practice. Furthermore, teachers were encouraged to engage in a blended learning knowledge exchange activity where participants were invited to highlight the knowledge and support needed and offer knowledge and support to colleagues. The effectiveness of the workshop methodologies is supported by outcomes from the workshops in the form of examples of blended learning solutions designed by the teachers. Furthermore photographs and other artefact produced during the workshops present visual confirmation of the blended learning design processes adopted by the teachers. Moreover, there are some interesting findings from the blended learning knowledge exchange activity which provides valuable insights into the teachers existing knowledge and skills. Also the necessary training for teachers wanting to embed blended learning solutions into their practice is presented, as well as the technologies that they use and the technological and pedagogical support necessary to implement blended learning solutions with a view to, enhancing the learning and teaching experience.","Blended learning; Change; Collaborative learning; Dialogic shamrock; Pedagogy; Technology enhanced learning","E-learning; Education; Engineering education; Knowledge management; Teaching; Blended learning; Change; Collaborative learning; Dialogic shamrock; Pedagogy; Technology enhanced learning; Personnel training","Ashworth, P.D., The variety of qualitative research (1997) Nurse Education Today, 17, pp. 215-224; Dillenbourg, P., What do you mean by collaborative learning?

Through a confirmatory factor analysis, the OIRBSwas validated infive constructs: course designerandorganizer (CDO), discussion facilitator (DF), social supporter (SS), technology facilitator (TF), and assessment designer (AD). The results showthat thefive factor structures remained invariant across the blended learning and online learning. Both students in blended learning environments and students in online learning environments exhibited the greatest weight in the CDO dimension, followed by the TF and DF dimensions. In addition, students in the online learning environments scored higher in the DF dimension than did those in the blended learning environments. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Many universities are embracingthe rapid changes stemming from the combined forces of information and communication technology (ICT), globalizationand internationalization of higher education. The University of Botswana (UB), like many other academic institutions in theworld, is undergoing transformative changes in response to internal and external influences on higher education. One suchchange is exemplified in the attempts to integrate ICT into the entire education process in order to enhance the educationalexperience of students. UB, like many other institutions of higher learning, views the use of ICT in teaching and learning asan important tool in facilitating reforms in the education system. The purpose of this paper is to discuss blended learning (aLearning Management System (LMS)) as one of the technological changes that took place at UB. It has been widely arguedin the literature that incorporation of the blended learning approach into teaching practice offers conveniences andefficiencies, freedom for students to express thoughts, and ask questions without limitations at the same time meeting theirdifferent needs and learning styles. This paper presents reflections on the progress of the infusion of blended learning withina developing world context and highlights some of the critical success strategies in implementing blended learning programsin tertiary institutions. Based on the literature review, the paper identifies the following factors as determinants for thesuccessful implementation of blended learning: users' training, organization commitment, management support, attitude ofusers, consultation, manpower and support from other departments, infrastructure, clarity on the strategic imperatives fortechnology use and, monitoring and evaluation. The paper is informed by the researcher's PhD research thesis titled ""Theinfluence of technological change on organizational commitment: the case of academics at the University of Botswana"". Thepaper contributes to the literature on institutions of higher learning in Botswana. More broadly, the paper will contribute tothe literature in developing economies and addresses the gap identified by several researchers, that studies of educationalsettings have been concentrated in the western world.","Academics; Blackboard; Blended learning; Success factors; University of Botswana","Developing countries; E-learning; Education; Fire tube boilers; Management science; Societies and institutions; Students; Academics; Blackboard; Blended learning; Success factors; University of Botswana; Engineering education","Alhomod, S., Shafi, M.M., Success Factors of E-Learning Projects: A Technical Perspective (2013) TOJET: The Turkish Online Journal of Educational Technology, 12 (2), pp. 247-253; Caravias, V., Literature Review in Conceptions and Approaches to Teaching using Blended Learning (2014) International Journal of Innovation in the Digital Economy, 6 (3), pp. 46-73; Chai, G., Yen, P.N., E-Learning in Malaysia: Success Factors in Implementing E-Learning Program (2008) International Journal of Teaching and Learning in Higher Education, 20 (2), pp. 1-30; Islam, A.K.M., Investigating E-learning System Usage Outcomes in the University Context (2013) Computers & Education, 69 (1), pp. 387-399; Masalela, R.K., Potential Benefits and Complexities of Blended Learning in Higher Education: The Case of the University of Botswana (2009) Turkish Online Journal of Distance Education, 10 (2), pp. 66-82; Masalela, R.K., Twists and Turns of Climbing the E-learning Curve: The story of Masters in Project Management at the University of Botswana (2010), Paper read at The Fifth Conference of Learning International Networks Consortium (LINC), Massachusetts, USA, May; Molelu, G.B., Uys, P.M., Development of eLearning at the University of Botswana: Challenges, achievements, and pointers to the future (2003) E-learning Initiative at the University of Botswana: Challenges and Opportunities, 19 (3), pp. 99-109. , Paper read at ELearning Conference, MORUO Communications, Johannesburg, South Africa, August.Mutula, M.S.

However, the adoption of BL practices continues at a low pace due to academics' low digital fluency, various views and BL definitions, and limited standards-based tools to guide academic practice. To address these issues, this paper introduces a BL framework, based on one definition and with criteria and standards of practice to support the evaluation and advancement of BL in higher education. The framework is theoretically underpinned by the extant literature and supported by focus group discussions. The evidence supporting the criteria and standards are discussed with suggestions for how they can be used to guide course design, academic practice, and professional development. © 2015 N.

Following the design research approach, we propose a framework for creating university courses that support content and language integrated learning (CLIL) within a virtual learning environment (VLE). The framework was developed on the basis of our experience and a survey conducted among students of Cracow University of Economics, Poland, who study in a non-native language. It incorporates a blended-learning model. All course materials are prepared in Polish and English and are available for multilingual student population in a bilingual VLE course. The framework might be useful for other transition economies where a political and economic transformation has brought similar shifts in language skill requirements. © 2015 Commonwealth Secretariat.","blended learning; CLIL; design research; e-learning; Poland; transition economy; VLE",,"Amiel, T., Reeves, T.C., Design-based research and educational technology: Rethinking technology and the research agenda (2008) Educational Technology & Society, 11 (4), pp. 29-40; Anderson, T., Shattuck, J., Design-based research: A decade of progress in education research?

While the performance of students is obtained by marking their quantitative output on the busineß game or case exercise, their learning experience is measured through an analysis of the course evaluations filled out by these students. Diversity among the test population is guaranteed by testing our experiments on a sample of students with a different background, ranging from university students with or without a strong quantitative background but no practical experience, to MBA students at busineß schools and PM profeßionals participating in a PM training.","Blended Learning; Communication; Integration; Project Management","Communication; E-learning; Education; Integration; Project management; Teaching; Blended learning; Case-studies; Course evaluations; Learning experiences; Practical experience; Project management experience; Student performance; University students; Students","Batselier, J., Vanhoucke, M., Construction and evaluation framework for a real-life project database (2015) International Journal of Project Management, 33, pp. 697-710; Elving, W., The role of communication in organizational change.

While much research is available on the effectiveness of individual apps and educational approaches and despite that many higher education institutions introduced special mobile learning apps, relatively little is known about the rationale of scaling up mobile learning in higher education institutions. It reports on a case study, in which a mobile app solution has been integrated into a lecture at a major Swiss university. The study analyses the student’s use of mobile media and the use of a smart-phone app in a mobile blended learning setting. The results indicate that today’s students live in a multi device environment and are likely to use mobile apps in new contexts and settings if this is supported by an app. They also show that mobiles will not replace other delivery modes or technologies. Instead, the findings indicate that students used the mobile learning solution for extending and enriching their learning environment. Therefore, this study suggests that mobile learning needs to blend into rich learning environments, in which they co-exist with paper books, classroom experiences, laptops, and tablets. The insights define new requirements for both, mobile apps and virtual learning environments, in order to meet the future challenges of TEL in higher education. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.","Blended learning; Case-study; Device ecologies; Device usage; Educational design; Evaluation; Higher education; Mobile learning; Seamless learning","Computer aided instruction; Education; Engineering education; Online systems; Smartphones; Students; Teaching; Blended learning; Device usage; Evaluation; Higher education; Mobile Learning; Seamless learning; E-learning","Our Mobile Planet, , http://think.withgoogle.com/mobileplanet/en; Glahn, C., (2013) Mobile Learning in Security and Defense: Foundations, Technologies, Approaches and Challenges, , https://lo-f.at/glahn/2015/03/30/REPORT_MLearning_v14%20-%20final%20-%20with%20CC%20%281%29.pdf, Report; Center for security studies.

The methodology has been based on the results of experiments with students from social sciences, economics and technical faculties. Numerous tests were carried out to find out the level of prior knowledge and the preferred learning styles of each student. According to the results, students were divided into separate groups within an e-learning environment. The authors considered three main aspects: student's background, the level of knowledge and the most suitable style of learning. The success of the experiment presented in this paper is demonstrated by comparing the academic results of the test group who was taught using the new strategy with the reference group, taught in a common way.","E-Learning; Felder-Silverman model; Flexible learning","E-learning; Education; Students; Teaching; Blended learning; E-learning environment; Flexible Learning; Informatics; Learning Style; Prior knowledge; Reference group; University students; Computer aided instruction","Broadbent, B., (2002) ABCs of E-Learning: Reaping the Benefits and Avoiding the Pitfalls, , 1st ed.

Following current trends in education and technology development we focused on supporting active learning (AL) paradigm by Virtual Learning Environment (VLE). First, over the course of a pilot survey conducted among Polish and UK lectures, we examined the current usage of ICT in teaching, incorporation of AL methods, and teachers' needs associated with developing university courses that support AL. The survey results indicate that the majority of lecturers rarely used AL methods and they are unaware which VLE tools could support this model of instruction. On the basis of our experience and survey results we propose a university course framework in which selected VLE tools and external VLE integrated applications support AL. The framework includes also suggestions for knowledge and technical teachers' skills assistance that could help them to implement AL methods. The results of the research might be useful for practitioners who would like to incorporate innovative methods of learning into an educational process and benefit from ICT.","Active learning; Blended-learning; Education enhancement; ICT application; Virtual learning environment","Aluminum; Artificial intelligence; Computer aided instruction; Curricula; Education; Engineering education; Information science; Surveys; Teaching; Active Learning; Blended learning; Educational process; Information and Communication Technologies; Information society; Integrated applications; Technology development; Virtual learning environments; E-learning","Allen, I.E., Seaman, J., (2014) Grade Change.

While this is a commendable move, it is a known fact that the mere provision of access to higher education is no guarantee to success. It is also common knowledge that the use of technology in teaching and learning in higher education institutions is no longer a debate but has become a fundamental principle. In an attempt to support students and to enhance learning, in 2004 e-learning was introduced as one of the university's teaching and learning strategies. The latter has been applied in various learning programmes across the institution. As part of blended learning, digital storytelling was piloted as a teaching and learning tool in some of the Extended Curricular Programmes (ECP) with the view to address gaps in students' academic skills. Simply put, the term blended learning refers to the fusion of face-to-face teaching and learning with online content and other media while digital storytelling, an e-learning tool, is a modern expression of the ancient art of storytelling that requires the use of digital multimedia in narrating a particular story. First year students taking the Lifestyle Management course were exposed to digital storytelling and were asked to create their own digital stories. Evaluation was subsequently conducted to assess the effectiveness of this technique. The objective of this paper is three-fold:1) to share students' experiences of using digital storytelling, 2) to demonstrate how the practice can be utilized to advance learning in higher education, 3) to reflect on the effectiveness of digital storytelling as a teaching and learning tool. The application of digital storytelling as a teaching and learning tool revealed that although initially challenging and time consuming, digital storytelling can be an exciting and effective teaching and learning tool. Students felt that it was an exciting and empowering tool. Although some challenges were experienced, it can be concluded that the practice is highly effective for academics in catering for different learning styles when teaching, and it advances a multitude of digital literacies, a prerequisite for graduates in the 21st century.","Blended learning; Digital immigrants; Digital natives; Digital storytelling; Higher education; Reflective practice; Teaching and Larning","Education; Students; Teaching; Blended learning; Digital immigrants; Digital natives; Digital storytelling; Higher education; Reflective practices; E-learning","Digital storytelling (2008) Digital Photography and Video Guide, , https://www._2008_adobe_Systems_Incorporated_Digital_Storytelling; Brown, J., Bryan, J., Brown, T., Twenty-first century literacy and technology in k-8 classrooms (2005) Innovate Journal of Online Education, 1 (3). , http://www.innovateonline.info/index.php?view=article&id=17; Dreon, O., Kerper, R.M., Landis, J., Digital storytelling: A tool for teaching and learning in the youtube generation (2011) Middle School Journal, 42 (5), pp. 4-9. , http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ934075.pdf; (2007) Educause Learning Initiative, , http://net.educause.edu/ir/library/pdf/ELI7021.pdf, 7 Things you Should Know About Digital Story Telling; Frand, J.L., The information-age mindset: Changes in students and implications for higher education (2000) Educause Review, 35 (5), pp. 14-26. , https://net.educause.edu/apps/er/erm00/articles005/erm0051.pdf; Gunter, G., Kenny, R., Digital booktalk: Digital media for reluctant readers (2008) Contemporary Issues in Technology and Teacher Education, 8 (1), pp. 84-99; Jones, C., Ramanau, R., Cross, S., Healing, G., Net generation or digital natives: Is there a distinct new generation entering university?"", [ (2010) Computers and Education, 54 (3), pp. 722-732. , oro.open.ac.uk; Kahn, P., Young, R., Grace, S., Pilkington, R., Rush, L., Tomkinson, B., Willis, I., Theory and legitimacy in professional education: A practitioner review of reflective processes within programmes for new academic staff (2008) International Journal for Academic Development, 13 (3), pp. 161-173. , http://www.informaworld.com; Kennedy, G.E., Judd, T.S., Churchward, A., Gray, K., Krause, K.L., First year students'experiences with technology: Are they really digital natives?

The concept has been developed for coordinate metrology as a discipline with an important contribution to innovation related to modern manufacturing and its impact in national's economies. In this implementation, a combination of face-to-face training and practical experience is used as well as online learning for theory transfer using Internet's possibilities. This approach can be used to support certificated education and lifelong learning, largely independent on the learner's geographical location and the infrastructures available. This work has been developed according to the case study approach methodology and grounded on the eLearning tutorial model designed for ""CMTrain Training for Coordinate Metrology"". This is a certified education, with three levels that are oriented to several personal profiles such as manufacturing companies staff, research and development professionals as well as university students at different levels, focused on experiencing engineering and promoting a formal self-learning in a flexible way, using different media channels to achieve the contents and interact with the tutors. The paper will be grounded on the collaboration's experience of the Interstate University of Applied Sciences of Technology (NTB) and the Technological Centre for the Metal Working Industry (CATIM). Based on this experience as well on the feedback from participants, the further procedure for development of the training concept is discussed. New developments of the learning concept are pointed out with innovative ideas such as the use of new media channels for the distribution of learning and the use of new ways to present the learning material in a user-centred way. To do so, the needs of the participants using the approach of mobile learning were discussed. First results and feedback of a new way to perform workshops on the basis of remote access to devices are being presented.","Blended learning; Coordinate measurement training; Elearning; Remote training; Vocational training","Education; Education computing; Engineering education; Industrial research; Manufacture; Metal working; Teaching; Units of measurement; Blended learning; Coordinate measurements; Geographical locations; Manufacturing companies; Remote training; Research and development; University of applied science; Vocational training; E-learning","(2007) Open Source Course Management System for Online Learning, , Free Moodle-A; (1995) Geometrical Product Specification (GPS)-Masterplan, , ISO/TR 14638:1995-12, Beuth: Berlin; Keferstein, C., (2004) EUKOM-European Training for Coordinate Metrology, pp. 351-358. , VDI BERICHTE; Keferstein, C.P., Marxer, M., Weckenmann, A., Beetz, S., (2005) Ein Europäisch Abgestimmtes, Auf ELearning Basierendes, Neues Ausbildungskonzept für Die Koordinatenmesstechnik; Innovative Entwicklungen im Fokus des Anwenders, , EUKOM Tagung Braunschweig 15. und 16.

One possible approach to explore the quality of online learning is to adopt the perspective of the decision-makers, the higher educational institutions and their staff. Another approach is to investigate what are the different dimensions of quality online learning experience from the perspective of students. This article presents a study of students' opinions and attitudes about the quality of different elements in the pedagogical design of blended courses. The majority of the students involved in the research have had no or little experience in online learning. The authors try to find out whether there is a relation between the students' previous experience in e-learning and their judgements about different aspects of its quality.

What course content is essential in the course, where can more information be found and which assignments are mandatory? Research has stated that learner control (Chou & Liu, 2005) and motivation (Keller & Suzuki, 2004) are crucial issues for successful online education. This paper presents and discusses visualisation as a channel to improve learner control, and gamification as a way to increase study motivation in virtual learning environments. Data has been collected by evaluation questionnaires and group discussions in two courses partly given in the Moodle virtual learning environment. One course is on Game based learning for Bachelor's programmes, the other is a course on e-learning for university teachers. Both the courses have used progress bars to visualise students' study paths and digital badges for gamification. Results have also been discussed with teachers and pedagogues at a department for computer and systems sciences. Findings indicate that visualisation by progress bars is a good way to improve course participants' overview in online environments with rich and multifaceted content. To what degree the visualisation facilitates the course completion is hard to estimate, and like students have different learning styles, they also seem to have different visualisation needs. Gamification by digital badges seems to have various motivational impacts in different study groups and in traditional university programmes the traditional grades seem to be the main carrots.","Blended learning; E-learning; Gamification; Virtual learning environments; Visualisation","Computer aided instruction; Curricula; Distance education; Education; Motivation; Social networking (online); Surveys; Teaching; Visualization; Blended learning; Game-based Learning; Gamification; Group discussions; Online environments; Traditional universities; University teachers; Virtual learning environments; E-learning","Bíró, G.I., Didactics 2.0: A pedagogical analysis of gamification theory from a comparative perspective with a special view to the components of learning (2014) Proceedings of Social and Behavioral Sciences, 141, pp. 148-151. , http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S187704281403451X, 25 August 2014; Brown, K.M., The role of internal and external factors in the discontinuation of off-campus students (1996) Distance Education, 17, pp. 44-71; Chou, S.W., Liu, C.H., Learning effectiveness in a web-based virtual learning environment: A learner control perspective (2005) Journal of Computer Assisted Learning, 21 (1), pp. 65-76; Creswell, J.W., (2009) Research Design: Qualitative, Quantitative, and Mixed Methods Approaches (3rd Ed.), , SAGE ...

The recommended framework is a result of lessons learned during this project in Ghana and as such, it is shaped by the need to be responsive to the local cultural and contextual contingencies. The article offers practical recommendations on the implementation of a mobile learning project in a cross-cultural setting, and provides a discussion of the salient cultural factors and the corresponding culturally-sensitive adaptations needed in the design research process.

In China, new higher education (HE) teachers often lack teaching experience because there are limited teaching opportunities during their postgraduate studies. This status quo may compromise the quality of teaching and learning in higher education institutions. In 2013, Shanghai Municipal Education Commission initiated a professional development program for new teachers from all local higher education institutions. This article examines their ICT professional development through the lens of Kirkpatrick's evaluation model. Data were collected from online surveys both immediately after an ICT module and 6 months later. The results showed that participants intended to integrate ICT in teaching and had an above-average level of Technological Pedagogical and Content Knowledge (TPACK). Participants and their department heads also confirmed distinctive teaching performance of these new teachers and better learning behavior of their students. The study revealed that demographic variables of new HE teachers may also affect their perception of ICT and TPACK. This study suggests that ICT professional development can have positive impacts on new HE teachers' perception of ICT, their TPACK competence, and ICT-related teaching practice and student learning. © SAGE Publications.","blended learning; information and communication technology; Kirkpatrick; technological pedagogical and content knowledge; technology acceptance model",,"Anderson, A., Barham, N., Northcote, M., Using the TPACK framework to unite disciplines in online learning (2013) Australasian Journal of Educational Technology, 29 (4), pp. 549-565; Arthur, W., Jr., Tubre, T.C., Paul, D.S., Edens, P.S., Teaching effectiveness: The relationship between reaction and learning criteria (2003) Educational Psychology, 23, pp. 275-285; Bagozzi, R.P., The legacy of the technology acceptance model and a proposal for a paradigm shift (2007) Journal of the Association for Information Systems, 8 (4), pp. 244-254; Benson, S.N.K., Ward, C.L., Teaching with technology: Using TPACK to understand teaching expertise in online higher education (2013) Journal of Educational Computing Research, 48 (2), pp. 153-172; Chai, C.S., Koh, J.H.L., Tsai, C.C., Facilitating preservice teachers' development of technological, pedagogical, and content knowledge (TPACK) (2010) Educational Technology and Society, 13 (4), pp. 63-73; Chai, C.S., Koh, J.H.L., Tsai, C.C., A review of technological pedagogical content knowledge (2013) Educational Technology & Society, 16 (2), pp. 31-51; Chai, C.S., Ng, E.M.W., Li, W.H., Hong, H.Y., Koh, J.H.L., Validating and modelling technological pedagogical content knowledge framework among Asian preservice teachers (2013) Australasian Journal of Educational Technology, 29 (1), pp. 41-53; Chang, C.Y., Chien, Y.T., Chang, Y.H., Lin, C.Y., Magdaire: A model to foster pre-service teachers' ability in integrating ICT and teaching in Taiwan (2012) Australasian Journal of Educational Technology, 28 (6), pp. 983-999; Chen, R.J., Investigating models for preservice teachers' use of technology to support student-centered learning (2010) Computers & Education, 55 (1), pp. 32-42; Cole, K., Simkins, M., Penuel, W.R., Learning to teach with technology: Strategies for inservice professional development (2002) Journal of Technology and Teacher Education, 10 (3), pp. 431-455; Collins, A., Brown, J.S., Newman, S.E., Cognitive apprenticeship: Teaching the crafts of reading, writing, and mathematics (1989) Knowing, Learning, and Instruction: Essays in Honor of Robert Glaser, 18, pp. 32-42; Cullen, T.A., Greene, B.A., Preservice teachers' beliefs, attitudes, and motivation about technology integration (2011) Journal of Educational Computing Research, 45 (1), pp. 29-47; Davis, F.D., Perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and user acceptance of information technology (1989) MIS Quarterly, 13 (3), pp. 319-340; Deci, E.L., Ryan, R.M., Self-determination theory and the facilitation of intrinsic motivation, social development, and well-being (2000) American Psychologist, 55, pp. 68-78; Desimone, L.M., Improving impact studies of teachers' professional development: Toward better conceptualizations and measures (2009) Educational Researcher, 38 (3), pp. 181-199; Divaharan, S., Koh, J.H.L., Learning as students to become better teachers: Pre-service teachers' IWB learning experience (2010) Australasian Journal of Educational Technology, 26 (4), pp. 553-570; Ebert-May, D., Derting, T.L., Hodder, J., Momsen, J.L., Long, T.M., Jardeleza, S.E., What we say is not what we do: Effective evaluation of faculty professional development programs (2011) Bioscience, 61 (7), pp. 550-558; Garrison, D.R., Vaughan, N.D., (2011) Blended Learning in Higher Education, , San Francisco, CA: Jossey-Bass; Gitterman, A., Germain, C.B., (2008) The Life Model of Social Work Practice: Advances in Theory and Practice, , 3rd ed.

This methodological study investigates the impact of the provision of lecture choice (online or f2f) on overall student achievement and course engagement. This research uses a within-group design to obtain baseline data on a single set of physics students (n=168), and investigates the impact of providing a lecture viewing choice (online, f2f) mid-semester on student achievement (tests, homework, and standardized conceptual evaluation scores), and course engagement (student lecture viewing, homework submissions, bonus project submissions, and note taking behaviors). The study reveals that the type of lecture does not serve to significantly impact overall student achievement or engagement. However, although recorded and f2f lectures demonstrate an overall educationally equivalent impact, students who elect a high level of recorded lecture use were significantly lower performing and less engaged before the option to watch recorded lectures was introduced and largely continued to be so after the option was introduced, but there was evidence of a reduction in achievement and engagement differences after the option is introduced. Therefore, results of this study suggest weaker performing students self-select higher levels of recorded lecture use, and the use of these video lectures may assist this specific group of students in closing the gap between themselves and students who were initially higher performing and more engaged. © 2015 Sloan Consortium.

In addition, as the Number 1 University in the UK for Social Innovation as evidenced through our 2013 designation as the first AshokaU Changemaker Campus in the UK, all areas within the University were tasked with embedding social innovation at the heart of student experience. These two imperatives converged with the birth of Employability Plus (E+), our new extracurricular employability offer that delivers a blended, personalised, student-centric approach to the development of student employability. Employability Plus was developed by the University Centre for Employability and Engagement (UCEE) under their remit to improve graduate employability. The service was delivered through the adoption and adaptation of a strategy known as CAIeRO (Creating Aligned Interactive educational Resource Opportunities), widely used in curriculum (re-)design at Northampton; combined with the iterative design-centred approach typified in the Spiral of Social Innovation. Employability Plus seeks to deliver long-term scalability and sustainability, incentivises engagement through the allocation of E+ points and feeds directly into Section 6.1 of the Higher Education Achievement Report (HEAR) detailing a student's extra-curricular university achievements. It intentionally draws on blended learning design cycles through ensuring active student engagement with tasks that make sense of employability-related content, working individually or collaboratively and discussing with their peers and E+ advisors either online or face-to-face. Students undertake regular online audits of their employability skills and are directed to events/interventions designed to encourage deeper engagement with and individual responsibility for their own employability development. Less than six months after launching, E+ had seen over 8,500 students engaged for more than 45 minutes with online activities, or through workshop attendance - a 10-fold increase on the previous year. More than 2,000 students had completed the initial self-assessment and over 1,800 had participated in a 1:1 session. More than 1,000 were participating in voluntary community action and social learning. Subsequent development of E+ is taking a number of directions. Most importantly, the service is part of a project to embed employability into the curriculum. Blending curricular and extracurricular employability skills development in this way allows students to demonstrate their growth and employability potential to future employers by drawing on experiences gained from across the full breadth of their life experiences. This paper offers an empirical evaluation of the redesign approach adopted for this development, specifically considering: how effective this dual approach was at delivering a unified service that would be blended, relevant and scalable; and whether it is appropriate to use the language of higher education (learning outcomes, learning activities and assessment) in the context of extracurricular employability development. The paper also considers the importance of the student voice in the curriculum design process and presents some wider issues for consideration by course designers to ensure students can act as co-creators of curricular and blended learning, thereby improving student engagement and attainment. It is, however, too early to evaluate the effectiveness of the redesigned service in improving professional-level employability for Northampton graduates.","Co-curricular; E-learning design; Employability; Social innovation; Student voice","Blending; Curricula; Design; E-learning; Education; Innovation; E-learning design; Educational resource; Empirical evaluations; Employability; Employability skills; Professional levels; Social innovations; Student experiences; Students","Alden Rivers, B., Armellini, A., Nie, M., 'Embedding social innovation and social impact across the disciplines: Identifying ""Changemaker"" attributes', Higher Education Skills and Work Based Learning., , in press; Armellini, A., Jones, S., Carpe Diem: Seizing each day to foster change in e-learning design.

Not all secondary school graduates are equally prepared to meet the demands of an engineering programme; different school types and mathematics curricula lead to broad differences in basic knowledge. As a remedy, universities offer pre-courses or bridging courses in mathematics, more and more frequently employing e-learning or blended learning programmes. The paper describes the development of an online course for study preparation in mathematics. The design process is accompanied by a research project that analyses both quality of the learning material and performance of the participants. In a multiphase research design repeated evaluations of test results, questionnaire data and statistical information are used to revise and successively improve the programme. The overall goal is to build a precourse that meets the demands of the group of prospective engineering students. The main research interest is to build a consistent data model that relates students' personal and demographic backgrounds, prior knowledge in mathematics, and learning outcomes in the pre-course. In the first design phase, or pre-study, the most relevant issues that should be addressed in the further course of the project were identified, applying qualitative methods to question (or confirm) quantitative outcomes. Based on these results, learning material and quantitative tools were modified, and re-evaluated. The final data model for the main study is based on three quantitative sources: pre- and posttest performance, persona questionnaire, and evaluation questionnaire. The results so far reveal a highly heterogenic learner group regarding cognitive and metacognitive variables. While many students are able to close minor gaps via self-study, others lack the ability to selfregulate and need support structuring and monitoring the learning process. Thus different learning scenarios, from self-study to blended learning to online tutoring, were provided and evaluated in 2014. In the article examples for the use of learning analytics in the developmental design process and the latest version of the programme are given. The pre-posttest design's reliability was increased based on statistical analyses of students' test results. Test results then could be related to known predictors of mathematics performance, e.g. school grades, or attitude towards mathematics. Analytics were also made accessible for students by relating individual results to the peer group's overall score. Finally, pretest results were used to cluster students with similar results and assign them to matching learner groups. In the further course of the project the data collected in the pre-course will be related to external datasets, like first year exams in mathematics, and overall study success. It will be investigated if and how these correlate with learning progress in the pre-course and predictive variables like prior knowledge, type of secondary school, or attitude towards mathematics. Findings are incorporated into a joint research project funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (www.optes.de).","Design based research; E-assessment; Mathematics; Self-study; STEM","Curricula; Design; Education; Education computing; Mathematical techniques; Students; Surveys; Teaching; Design-based research; E assessments; German Federal Ministry of Education and Research; Mathematics curricula; Predictive variables; Self-study; Statistical information; Successive refinement; E-learning","Akey, T.M., School context, student attitudes and behaviour, academic achievement.

This paper evaluates the concept of digital literacy through the transformation of a first year module from a traditionally delivered university lecture/seminar approach to a technology enhanced discursive approach that aspires to transform the way students learn, in order to lead them to higher level digital skills. Digital skills from the user perspective focus on their effective use of digital resources and the skills in the use of online technologies. In this module, students are guided to evaluate and assess the tools and information they use online and consider the privacy of their identity. We posit that an understanding of such digital skills and advanced online behaviour will support future employability and that such a digital skillset is a core graduate attribute that will be expected by employers. This paper shares the process of redesigning the curriculum to embed experiential digital skills and the insight to online behaviour. The redesign of the curriculum works to enhance and support the first year experience, building in more personalisation and individual attention than can be achieved in the traditional version. Based upon Salmon et al (2008) curriculum design process, and using JISC's (2014) seven elements of Digital Literacy model, this research will share how the redesign was undertaken by the module team working collaboratively with a learning designer and former students to support, develop and enhance digital literacy skills throughout. We will consider the pedagogy of business education in terms of graduate attributes and employability and how to embed digital employability skills within a blended learning design for first year students in higher education.","Curriculum design; Digital literacy; Employability; First year experience","Curricula; Design; E-learning; Education; Education computing; International trade; Business educations; Curriculum designs; Digital literacies; Employability; Employability skills; First year students; First-year experience; University graduates; Students","Ala-Mutka, K., Punie, Y., Redecker, C., Digital Competance for Lifelong Learning (2008) Policy Brief, , ftp://ftp.jrc.es/pub/EURdoc/EURdoc/JRC48708.TN.pdf, European Commission.[online] [Accessed on: 10/06/15]; Barrie, C., A research-based approach to generic graduate attributes policy (2004) Higher Education Research & Development., 23 (3), pp. 261-275; Besser, H., The Next Digital Divides (2001) The Digital Divide, 1, p. 2. , http://tcla.gseis.ucla.edu/divide/politics/besser.html, Accessed 23/2/13; Blades, R., Fauth, B., Gibb, J., (2012) Measuring Employability Skills.

In higher education, it completely or partially substitutes the classical teaching methods. It provides richer resources than the traditional classroom and overcomes its limitations (time and space). In some cases, it has proved to be very effective. Some authors, however, also point out that e-learning requires highly self-regulated and independent students or their e-learning performance may be low. The purpose of the paper is to analyse how introduction of the e-learning system Moodle as part of the teaching process is related with students' performance, i.e. the average grade and the average number of admissions to the exams. We also examined the same relationship among different groups of students (based on selected individual socio-demographic factors). The study included a member of the University of Ljubljana (Faculty of Administration) with public administration programmes as our sample in the period from 2008 till 2014. The results of the analysis (using a t-test) show a significant improvement in performance (a higher average grade and lower average number of admissions) at the different (faculty-, student- and course-) levels after introducing the Moodle e-learning platform. The data show that the greatest improvement is seen among students with lower high school grades. The results can serve as important guidelines for university management when further investigating how to enhance students' performance on different levels when employing modern ICT solutions in the teaching process.","Blended learning; E-learning; Higher education; Moodle; Public administration programme; Students' performance","E-learning; Education; Information use; Learning systems; Public administration; Students; Teaching; Blended learning; E-learning platforms; Higher education; Information and Communication Technologies; Moodle; Socio-demographic factors; Teaching and learning; Teaching methods; Engineering education","Ally, M., Foundations of educational theory for online learning (2004) Theory and Practice of Online Learning, pp. 3-31. , Anderson, T. and Elloumi (Eds.), Athabasca University; Aristovnik, A., The impact of ICT on educational performance and its efficiency in selected EU and OECD countries: A non-parametric analysis (2012) The Turkish Online Journal of Educational Technology, 11 (3), pp. 144-152; Berge, Z., Huang, Y., A model for sustainable student retention: A holistic perspective on the student dropout problem with special attention to e-learning (2004) DEOSNEWS, 13 (5). , http://www.ed.psu.edu/acsde/deos/deosnews/deosnews13_5.pdf, Retrieved 23.2.2015; Carr, S., As distance education comes of age, the challenge is keeping the students (2000) The Chronicle of Higher Education, 23. , http://chronicle.com/free/v46/i23/23a00101.htm, Retrieved 23.2.2015; Chien, T.C., Computer self-efficacy and factors influencing e-learning effectiveness (2012) European Journal of Training and Development, 36 (7), pp. 670-686; Liao, C.-W., Perspectives of university students on cooperative learning by Moodle (2011) International Journal of Digital Content Technology and Its Applications, 5 (6). , http://www.aicit.org/jdcta/ppl/22_%20JDCTA_June-26.pdf, Retrieved 23.2.2015; Cole, R.A., (2000) Issues in Web-based Pedagogy: A Critical Primer, , Westport, CT: Greenwood Press; Dagger, D., Wade, V.P., (2004) Evaluation of Adaptive Course Construction Toolkit (ACCT), , http://wwwis.win.tue.nl/~acristea/AAAEH05/papers/6-a3eh_daggerdIOS_format_v1.1.pdf, Retrieved 2.3.2015; Diaz, D.P., Online drop rates revisited (2002) The Technology Source, , http://technologysource.org/article/online_drop_rates_revisited/, May-June.

The Digital natives or the Net-generation are now enrolling university programmes and they are the first generation that has used computers and online tools since childhood. Programming education has a tradition of programming huts, where students in introductory programming courses get exercises to explore fundamental programming concepts with instant feedback. To provide quality feedback in the traditional form requires experienced facilitators and costly venues for today's large course batches. At the department where this study has been conducted there exists a tradition of a weekly lab hut for general Computer science but an online environment with 24/7 access would be an enhancement. This study has explored the potential of an online environment for programming exercises in the Python programming language named MyProgrammingLab. The aim of the study is to describe and discuss how an online programming laboratory might support the learning of programming concepts in introductory university courses. The research strategy has been a case study where data has been collected by an evaluation questionnaire, informal discussions and an analysis of students' study patterns in the virtual learning environment. Findings indicate that students have different learning styles and that some students have worked thoroughly with most of the material in MyProgrammingLab, but that the majority only have used the environment for the initial exercises on fundamental programming concepts. Some learners also mention that they got stuck in the online environment and that they lack the feedback that they can get in tradition face-to-face sessions. Conclusions are that the evaluated online environment can be a valuable extra tool for self-learning, but to reach a larger part of the course participants with their various learning styles there is a need for a closer alignment to the course content which would need a different course outline.","Blended learning; E-learning; Online learning environment; Programming education; Technology enhanced learning","Computer aided instruction; Computer programming; Curricula; Education; Engineering education; Online systems; Students; Blended learning; Introductory programming course; Learning-of-programming; Online learning environment; Programming education; Python programming language; Technology enhanced learning; Virtual learning environments; E-learning","Brekke, M., Early Testing of e-Exams in Calculus at University Level, In EDEN 2013 Annual Conference, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway, 12-15 June 2013 (2013), pp. 625-632. , European Distance and E-Learning Network; (2015), http://www.codecademy.com/, Learn to Code, (accessed 18/05/2015); Creswell, J.W., Research Design, Qualitative, Quantitative and Mixed Methods Approaches (2009), Sage Publications Inc; Denscombe, M., The good research guide: for small-scale social projects (2003), Open University, Maidenhead; Dunn, R., Understanding the Dunn and Dunn learning styles model and the need for individual diagnosis and prescription (1990) Reading, Writing and Learning Disabilities, 6, pp. 223-247; Eckerdal, A., Novice Programming Students' Learning of Concepts and Practise (2009), http://www.avhandlingar.se/avhandling/6809751ebf/, PhD Thesis Uppsala University, available at; Feldgen, M., Clua, O., Games as a motivation for freshman students learn programming (2004), 3 (34), pp. 11-16. , Frontiers in Education; Guzdial, M., Soloway, E., Log on education: teaching the Nintendo generation to program (2002) Communications of the ACM, 45 (4), pp. 17-21; Hu, M., Winikoff, M., Cranefield, S., Teaching novice programming using goals and plans in a visual notation (2012) Proceedings of the Fourteenth Australasian Computing Education Conference, 123, pp. 43-52. , Australian Computer Society, Inc; Lahtinen, E., Ala-Mutka, K., Jarvinen, H., A Study of Difficulties of Novice Programmers (2005) Innovation and Technology in Computer Science Education 2005, pp. 14-18; Larkin, T.L., Feldgen, M., Clua, O., A Global Approach to learning styles (2002) Frontiers in Education, FIE 2002. 32nd Annual (Vol., 2, pp. F1F-9. , IEEE; (2015), https://moodle.org/, Open-source learning platform (accessed 15/05/2015); (2015), http://www.pearsonmylabandmastering.com/global/, Pearson Higher Education, (accessed 12/05/2015) via; (2015), http://www.pearsonmylabandmastering.com/northamerica/myprogramminglab/, Pearson Higher Education, (accessed 14/01/2015) via; Prensky, M., Digital natives, digital immigrants part 1 (2001) On the horizon, 9 (5), pp. 1-6; Spires, H.A., 21st century skills and serious games: Preparing the N generation, Serious educational games, 13-23 (2008); (2015), https://teamtreehouse.com/, Learn with us, (accessed 18/05/2015); Yin, R.K., Case study research: Design and Methods (1989), Thousand Oaks: Sage",20488637,9781910810712; 9781910810729,,"English",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84977083869

The use of wireless, mobile, portable and handheld devices is gradually increasing and diversifying across every sector of education in both the developed and developing worlds. The mobile learning currently exploits both handheld computers and mobile (smart) telephones and other devices that work on the same set of functionalities. The use of handheld computers is obviously relatively immature in terms of both its technologies and its pedagogies, but it is developing rapidly. This study focuses on the use of mobile devices within teaching/learning English for specific purposes (ESP) in technical (bachelor) and engineering (master) higher education in Informatics and Management-related study programmes. Mobile devices were understood to be very small items which users carry anytime anywhere without the electrical supply been required. The research was conducted at the Faculty of Informatics and Management (FIM), University of Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic, monitoring what mobile devices students use for personal and education purposes. Running more than 250 online courses in LMS Blackboard in 2013/14 at FIM, since 2013/14 the Blackboard Mobile Learn™ version 4.0 for Apple and Android devices has been available and piloted. Totally in 21 ESP courses mobile-assisted language learning (MALL) principles were applied. The full versions of courses run traditionally within the LMS, and they were available on mobile devices in the limited extent as well. In other words, the blended learning model is applied which combines the distance form of study in online courses and personalized approach through mobile devices which satisfies the individual time/place preferences and bridges formal and informal learning. Three research questions were set to be researched. Are students sufficiently equipped with mobile devices? What purposes do students use the mobile devices? What is the studentś feedback after the MALL? These questions resulted from the background of the FRAME (Framework for the Rational Analysis of Mobile Education) model by Marguerite L. Koole. The model can/should be used to design a more efficient mobile learning process, as it takes into consideration the technical characteristics of mobile devices as well as social and personal aspects of learning and it places more emphasis on constructivism.","E-learning; Engineering education; Language education; M-learning; Mobile devices","Computational linguistics; Education; Education computing; Engineering education; Hand held computers; Information science; Mobile devices; Students; Teaching; Electrical supply; English for specific purpose; Language education; M-Learning; Mobileassisted language learning (MALL); Research questions; Teaching/learning; Technological development; E-learning","Abdullah, M.R.T.L., M-learning scaffolding model for undergraduate English language learning: Bridging formal and informal learning (2013) TOJET: The Turkish online journal of educational technolog, 12 (2), pp. 217-233; Golonka, E.M., Bowles, A.R., Frank, V.M., Richardson, D.L., Freynik, S., Technologies for foreign language learning (2014) Computer-assisted language learning, 27, p. 1; Hsu, L.W., English as a foreign language learnerśperception of mobile assisted language learning: a cross-national study (2013) Computer assisted language learning, 26 (3), pp. 197-213; Chang, C.K., Hsu, C.K., A mobile assisted synchronously collaborative translation-annotation system for English as a foreign language (EFL) reading comprehension (2011) Computer assisted language learning, 24, p. 2; Chen, X.B., Tablets for informal language learning: student usage and attitudes (2013) Language learning and technology, 17 (1), pp. 20-37; Cheng, C., Hwang, W.Y., Wu, S.Y., Shadiev, R., Xie, C.H., A mobile device and online system with contextual familiarity and its effects on English learning on campus (2010) Educational technology and society, 13, p. 3; Kearney, M., Schuck, S., Burden, K., Aubusson, P., Viewing mobile learning from a pedagogical perspective (2012) Research in Learning Technology, 20, pp. 1-17; Koole, M.L., A Model for Framing Mobile Learning (2009) In Mobile Learning.

The course is intended to overcome the insecurity and perceived lack of knowledge about data management which prevents library staff from proactively providing support to research staff with the management, storage and sharing of their research data. The course objectives are: 1) to transfer and exchange knowledge about data management, and 2) to provide participants with the skills required to advise researchers or research groups on efficient and effective ways of adding value to their data. The course is an additional service provided by 3TU.Datacentrum44 a digital repository for research data set up by the research libraries of the three Dutch Universities of Technology (3TU): Delft University of Technology, Eindhoven University of Technology, and the University of Twente. The paper describes the process of creating the course, the methodology, and the results of the two courses in 2012. There were three phases to creating the course: 1) an investigation of the training needs, 2) the design of the course and 3) the development of the training materials. The training needs could be divided into hard skills (such as data management basics, data citation and knowledge of the data browser interface) and soft skills (such as acquisition skills, advisory skills and a reflective attitude towards their profession). This has led to a course with a competency-based modular design, consisting of four modules. The project team consisted of 3TU.Datacentrum staff. The team designed a blended learning course, composed of a didactical mix of group meetings, online study and homework assignments, including the website Data Intelligence45 that provides online reference material. By using a modern collaboration environment and social media, the course meets the needs of the modern scientific community. The training methodology proved effective in creating a solid base for digital preservation and a network of starting data librarians. In the first half of 2012, 14 librarians participated in the pilot course and provided feedback. The feedback has been used to improve the next cycle of the course, which started in September 2012. In February 2013 the third cycle starts. This paper demonstrates the choices made during the design process. Finally, future plans are discussed. They include expanding the course to make the materials also suitable to researchers and other data repositories in cooperation with organisations from The Netherlands.","3TU.Datacentrum; DataIntelligence; Verbeeldingskr8","Design; Digital libraries; Digital storage; Human resource management; Information management; Knowledge management; Libraries; Personnel training; Social networking (online); 3TU.Datacentrum; Collaboration environments; DataIntelligence; Delft University of Technology; Eindhoven University of Technology; Homework assignments; University of Twente; Verbeeldingskr8; E-learning","Grim, R., Heijden Der M.Van, De Smaele, M., Verbakel, E., (2011) Witboek Dataprofessionals in Nederland [White Paper Data Professionals in the Netherlands], , http://www.surf.nl/nl/publicaties/pages/witboekdataprofessionals.aspx, [report]; Lyon, L., (2007) Dealing with Data: Roles, Rights, Responsibilities and Relationships: UKOLN, , http://www.jisc.ac.uk/media/documents/programmes/digitalrepositories/dealing_with_data_report-final.pdf, [report]; Macdonald, S., Donnelly, A., Rice, R., (2012) JISC Managing Research Data: Liaison Librarian Training, , http://www.slideshare.net/edinadocumentationofficer/jiscmanaging-research-data-liaison-librarian-training, [slideshow]",16130073,,,"English",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84922294253

However, in the real world, the strategy in primary schools seems to be to lock out media usage altogether in order to avoid trouble. The educational techniques behind media literacy, especially in respect to feature films, are very often reduced to providing an interpretational understanding of the story or knowledge about the production process. We argue that even for younger pupils, the reflection of design components and aesthetical structures is also relevant. In a more and more media driven society, processes of identity formation are increasingly attached to individual's media consumption and his or her social embedding. As Mikos (2000) points out, this process creates the phenomenon that the social relationships of younger generations depend to a high degree on aesthetic criteria. Therefore, aesthetic competence is an important requirement for one's ability to reflect on individual lifestyles. Gamification and Interactive Storytelling as a Pedagogical Concept: s aesthetic reflection is a highly subjective matter, the pedagogical methodology has to focus on creating individual experiences. In order to foster the perception of formal structures and raise awareness of different design qualities, we consider a pragmatic approach for the general structure, which encourages experimental exploration and creative activities (Joas 1988, Kerres/Witt 2002). Additionally, we pursue a gamification concept in the sense of meaningful gamification, as described by Nicholson. He focuses on an understanding of gamification which enables playful participation and is based on the freedom of exploration. This creates the possibility of making meaningful decisions enabled by an informational context, which engages people through social interactions. It is assumed that a playful activity involving film design components as variable structures can enhance an aesthetic and therefore more abstract perception of the presented film plots (see Sutton-Smith 1972, Ohler 1994, Friess 2011). Conceptual Approach for an Interactive Media Environment: The core concept behind the educational application is built upon an interactive storytelling tool, which allows the creation of different variations of the same story. In order to set up a situational context that confronts the pupils with a design problem, we introduce a narrative framework with two children arguing about the way they can design a short film. The narrative context is used to give the pupils the necessary information on design possibilities, allowing them to make decisions in the later experimental part. The application should be embedded in a blended learning situation. This means that a teacher introduces the informational portion, and more importantly, that the pupils can show and discuss their final versions of the short film within the class community. The project is realised at Furtwangen University and supported by the Institute for Media and Communication of Baden-Württemberg. The prototype will be evaluated with primary-school pupils in summer 2015.","Aesthetic education; Film design; Gamification; Interactive storytelling; Pragmatic didactics","Design; Motion pictures; Teaching; Conceptual approaches; Educational Applications; Film design; Gamification; Individual lifestyles; Interactive storytelling; Pragmatic didactics; Social relationships; Education","Branigan, E., Narrative Comprehension and Film, , Routledge, London/New York; Friess, R., (2010) Narrative versus spielerische Rezeption?

Integration of face-to-face and online learning with blending learning can enhance the learning experience and optimize seat time. In this chapter, the authors present the teaching of an Algorithm and Programming course in Computer Engineering Education via an artificial intelligencesupported blended learning approach. Since 2011, Computer Engineering education in Suleyman Demirel University Computer Engineering Department is taught with a blended learning method. Blended learning is achieved through a Learning Management System (LMS) by using distance education technology. The LMS is comprised of course materials supported with flash animations, student records, user roles, and evaluation systems such as surveys and quizzes that meet SCORM standards. In this chapter, the related education process has been supported with an intelligent program, which is based on teaching C programming language. In this way, it has been aimed to improve educational processes within the related course and the education approach in the department. The blended learning approach has been evaluated by the authors, and the obtained results show that the introduced artificial intelligencesupported blended learning education program enables both teachers and students to experience better educational processes. © 2015 by IGI Global.

Applications from games to augmented reality are thriving in research settings, and in some cases schools and universities, but relatively little is known about how such devices may be used for effective learning. This article discusses the selection and potential use of electronic games, simulations and augmented reality in mobile learning supported by an operational model called AIDLET. After analyzing the different approaches to the use of digital technology and games in education, and discussing their benefits and shortcomings, a framework was developed to facilitate the selection, repurposing, design and implementation of games, simulations and augmented reality, with focus on the practical aspects of the processes used in mobile learning. It is apparent that these devices for learning are valued by students and teachers alike, and that they may be used as personalized devices for amplifying learning, specifically through amplifying access to information, social networks, and ability to participate in the world. Furthermore, whereas traditional learning is based on knowledge memorization and the completion of carefully graded assignments, today, games, simulations and virtual environments turn out to be safe platforms for trial and error experimentation, i.e. learning by doing or playing. In this context, the AIDLET model was set out and verified against a taxonomy representing the main categories and genres of games, and the article concludes with implications for how teachers, instructional designers and technologists might best capitalize on the affordances of mobile devices when designing for blended learning and e-learning courses. © 2014, IGI Global.",,"Augmented reality; E-learning; Education computing; Mobile telecommunication systems; Smartphones; Teaching; Virtual reality; Design and implementations; Digital technologies; E-learning course; Effective learning; Graded assignments; Instructional designer; Operational model; Traditional learning; Education","Anderson, T., Teaching in an online learning context (2008) Theory and practice of online learning, pp. 343-366. , T.

Additional research is needed to guide institutions of higher education in strategically adopting and implementing blended learning on campus. The authors conducted a prior study in which they proposed a framework for institutional BL adoption (Graham, Woodfield, & Harrison, 2012), identifying three stages: (1) awareness/exploration, (2) adoption/early implementation, and (3) mature implementation/growth. The framework also identified key strategy, structure, and support issues universities may address at each stage. The current study applies this adoption framework to 11 U. S. institutions participating in a Next Generation Learning Challenge (NGLC) grant and attempting to transition from an awareness/ exploration of BL to the adoption/early implementation phase. The study also compares U.S. institutional strategy, structure, and support approaches to BL adoption and identifies patterns and distinctions. © 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Distance education and telelearning; Post-secondary education; Teaching/learning strategies","Adoption framework; Blended learning; Distance education and tele-learning; Higher education; Institutional strategy; Institutions of higher educations; Postsecondary education; Teaching/learning strategy; Distance education; Societies and institutions","Al-Sarrani, N., (2010) Concerns and Professional Development Needs of Science Faculty at Taibah University in Adopting Blended Learning, , (Doctoral dissertation).

One of the strategies is to implement the asynchronous type of interaction. An online activity in blended learning using e-learning models is known as a Learning Management System (LMS). Currently LMS has been widely applied in the educational process in higher education institutions. To assess the results of the application of the LMS, we need a quality model that can be referenced by developers of LMS. This study developed a model for the application of quality in an asynchronous blended learning system The model allows an LMS can be evaluated by a party who is not an expert in the field of software technology, especially for the users, who is usually not involved in the system development phase directly. This model is expected to be a reference for both by the developers and users. In this study, the quality of the application the model is applied based on ISO/IEC 9126. This model supports the evaluation of two primary requirements, the needs of virtual communication and the delivery of educational activities, which has seven features, namely: discussion boards, e-mail, blogs, lectures, assignments, quizzes and grades. The quality characteristics in this model, among others are the suitability of implementation, ease of procedures, flexibility (interaction, tests and learner control), user security permissions, as well as response time, availability, reliability and completeness of the system. So the quality factor is proposed functionality (suitability, accurateness, security), reliability (maturity), usability (learnability) and efficiency (time behavior). The proposed model was validated with a case study of LMS in the Politeknik Caltex Riau (LMS PCR). The results have shown that the model could offer a quality evaluation of LMS PCR. The model has been able to demonstrate that the LMS PCR was conformed to the requirements of an asynchrononous blended learning system. © 2014 IEEE.","asynchronous; blended learning; ISO/IEC 9126; learning management system","Application programs; Cost effectiveness; E-learning; Education; Education computing; Mobile security; Quality control; Social networking (online); Software engineering; Teaching; asynchronous; Blended learning; Educational activities; Higher education institutions; ISO/IEC 9126; Learning management system; Quality characteristic; Virtual communication; Learning systems","Marshall, S., Mitchell, G., An E-learning maturity model?

In this paper we highlight the need for targeted research into blended learning in mathematics at more than an individual unit scale, particularly in the context of the flipped classroom. The literature on the flipped classroom in mathematics is limited to reports from enthusiastic individuals who have flipped their units with more or less success, with no reports on the sustainability of these implementations. We take the perspective of a discipline that already faces certain challenges with respect to student preparedness and special needs to facilitate online learning. From the literature, we extract research questions that need to be addressed urgently, and that may in the future be used to form a discipline-specific framework for introducing blended learning.","Blended; Discipline specific challenges; Flipped classroom; Mathematics education","Education; Teaching; Blended; Blended learning; Discipline specific challenges; Flipped classroom; Mathematics education; Online learning; Research questions; Special needs; Education computing","(2014) Australian Mathematical Sciences Institute: Discipline Profile of the Mathematical Sciences, , http://www.amsi.org.au/images/stories/downloads/pdfs/general-outreach/discipline-profile-2014.pdf, AMSI.

In previous years, many researchers put forward blended learning, the mixture of e-learning and face-to-face learning, taking advantages of both learning modes. Now blended learning has grown rapidly in education, but it is at the preliminary stage of exploration, and there is a lack of studies that have examined the satisfaction with blended learning. Objective: To evaluate medical students' satisfaction and attitudes toward blended learning compared with previous traditional learning in medical education. Methods: The randomized controlled trial course lasted two weeks and included three parts: 1) slides, videos, further reading and discussion forum on Moodle interactive platform for e-learning; 2) contact session with local tutors, including questions answering and works on protocol; 3) face-to-face lectures and comments on protocol from a professor. A total of 27 medical students from Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science & Technology voluntarily took full participation in the course. After the course, questionnaire survey on satisfaction and attitudes was conducted via e-mail. Results: The response rate was 96.3% (26/27). Of all the respondents, 92.3% (24/26) were satisfied with the blended learning mode. Compared with previous traditional learning experience, 100% of the respondents believed that blended learning is more helpful and that they had better access to the learning materials and greater independence in study, 84.6% (22/26) thought their motivation was improved, 92.3% (24/26) believed their involvement with the course was increased, 73.1% (19/26) felt more in control of their learning, 88.5% (23/26) thought learning was more efficient. Moreover, 65.4% (17/26) were happy with the current mixture of e-learning and face-to-face contact time. Conclusions: Our results suggest that most of the medical students are satisfied with blended learning and that blended learning is better and more helpful than both traditional face-to-face learning and e-learning. Blended learning is promising and worthwhile for further application in medical education in China.","Attitudes; Blended learning; Medical education; Satisfaction; Students","E-learning; Education; Medical education; Mixtures; Surveys; Teaching; Attitudes; Blended learning; Face-to-face learning; Interactive platform; Questionnaire surveys; Randomized controlled trial; Satisfaction; Students' satisfaction; Students","Arbaugh, J.B., Virtual Classroom Characteristics And Student Satisfaction With Internet-Based Mba Courses (2000) Journal Of Management Education, 24, pp. 32-54; Arbaugh, J.B., Managing The On-Line Classroom (2002) Journal Of High Technology Management Research, 13, pp. 203-223; Bediang, G., Stoll, B., Geissbuhler, A., Klohn, A.M., Stuckelberger, A., Nko'o, S., Chastonay, P., Computer Literacy And E-Learning Perception In Cameroon: The Case Of Yaounde Faculty Of Medicine And Biomedical Sciences (2013) Bmc Med Educ, 13, p. 57; Choules, A.P., The Use Of Elearning In Medical Education: A Review Of The Current Situation (2007) Postgrad Med J, 83, pp. 212-216; Ellaway, R., Masters, K., Amee Guide 32: E-Learning In Medical Education Part 1: Learning, Teaching And Assessment (2008) Med Teach, 30, pp. 455-473; Graham, C.R., Emerging Practice And Research In Blended Learning (2013) Handbook Of Distance Education, pp. 333-350; Hara, N., Student Distress In A Web-Based Distance Education Course (2000) Information, Communication & Society, 3, pp. 557-579; Hong, K.-S., Relationships Between Students' And Instructional Variables With Satisfaction And Learning From A Web-Based Course (2002) The Internet And Higher Education, 5, pp. 267-281; Hong, K.S., Lai, K.W., Holton, D., Students' Satisfaction And Perceived Learning With A Web-Based Course (2003) Educational Technology & Society, 6, pp. 116-124; Kirkpatrick, D.L., (1975) Evaluating Training Programs, , Tata Mcgraw-Hill Education; Mcfarlin, B.K., Hybrid Lecture-Online Format Increases Student Grades In An Undergraduate Exercise Physiology Course At A Large Urban University (2008) Adv Physiol Educ, 32, pp. 86-91; Peng, Y., Wu, X., Atkins, S., Zwarentein, M., Zhu, M., Zhan, X.X., Zhang, F., Yan, W.R., Internet-Based Health Education In China: A Content Analysis Of Websites (2014) Bmc Med Educ, 14, p. 16; Pereira, J.A., Pleguezuelos, E., Meri, A., Molina-Ros, A., Molina-Tomas, M.C., Masdeu, C., Effectiveness Of Using Blended Learning Strategies For Teaching And Learning Human Anatomy (2007) Med Educ, 41, pp. 189-195; Piccoli, G., Ahmad, R., Ives, B., Web-Based Virtual Learning Environments: A Research Framework And A Preliminary Assessment Of Effectiveness In Basic It Skills Training (2001) Mis Quarterly, 25, pp. 401-426; Santhanam, R., Using Self-Regulatory Learning To Enhance E-Learning-Based Information Technology Training (2008) Information Systems Research, 19, pp. 26-47; So, H.J., Is Blended Learning A Viable Option In Public Health Education?

It illustrates how all of these components form part of an integrated system, in which change needs to be managed as a whole. The experience to date has shown the need to notice and deal with the concerns of academic teaching staff, and to be clear about which measurements of progress are meaningful and relevant. The specific context of this university has determined how the various blended learning initiatives have been prioritized. Although other university contexts will differ, the overall framework could be applied in any institution to help align institutional initiatives to adopt blended and mobile learning, and to develop appropriate evaluation.","Blended learning evaluation; Institutional blended learning strategy; Mobile learning strategy","E-learning; Education; Societies and institutions; Blended learning; Integrated systems; Measurements of; Mobile Learning; Teaching staff; University context; Learning systems","Creswell, J.W., Plano-Clark, V.L., (2011) Designing and Conducting Mixed Methods Research, , (2nd ed.

A new e-learning approach has emerged out of globalized digital technologies that is transnational blended learning. Parallel to these developments, two adverse factors are threatening the education of generations: instable failing world economies and the masses of new students who are attending college each year. These conflicting uncertainties are risking the professional preparation of millions of young people due to economic shortages to finance both new colleges and the costs of students' education. Hence, an urgent well thought methodology deems necessary to neutralize the above negative consequences. This is called here a ""transnational collaborative neo-blended learning"" (TCnBL). ""TCnBL"" is mainly conceptualized upon the system design framework. Practically, It necessitates the work of three fundamental factors: The clinical academic and counseling resource teacher, the student initiator, and the educational connected resource room. In reality however, ""TCnBL"" is implemented through seven consequent systemic clinical steps. For managing students' education, the proposed paradigm is adopting a principle of ""guided open in- open out learning"" that allows students individually and as small groups, mostly online, to initiate learning and progress in achievement tasks without apparent external barriers. Thus, individual students are able to proceed in leaning at anytime, anywhere, by any available means without the constraints of conventional schooling facilities, schedules, equipments, manpowers and rigid examinations. Nonetheless, what is essentially required for the new paradigm to thrive is to transform the traditional services, infrastructures and ""mass"" educational methodology of schools and universities into non-directive counseling, organizing, sharing and open supporting learning resource centers.","Growth needs; Neo-blended learning; Responsive sources; Tcnbl exchange theory; Tcnbl paradigm; Transnational collaboration","E-learning; Education; Engineering education; Societies and institutions; Teaching; Blended learning; Digital technologies; E-learning approach; Educational methodologies; Tcnbl exchange theory; Tcnbl paradigm; Traditional services; Transnational collaboration; Students","(2011) Classical and Operant Conditioning, , http://allpsych.com/psychology101/; (2014), http://www.ascd.org/professional-development/, ASCD PD Online; Seven Skills Students Need for Their Future (2014), http://asiasociety.org/, After Dr. Tony Wagner's book, The Global Achievement Gap; Barr, R.B., Tagg, J., From Teaching to Learning - A New Paradigm for Undergraduate Education (2004), http://critical.tamucc.edu/; Blau, P., (1964) Exchange and power in social life, , http://books.google.jo/, New York: Wiley; Bolkan, J., (2014) Survey: Most Mobile Device Deployments Are Not 1:1.

UTM believes that e-learning is able to increase and enhance opportunities for campus-based students. However, UTM has no intention to conduct solely online learning. As a tertiary institution, UTM aims at becoming a university with online environment and yet maintaining traditional campus-based learning. As teaching a blended course should start with a re-examination of the intended learning outcomes of the course, the teacher needs to design specific online and classroom activities. This research describes the evaluation studies of the computer subject (authoring language) module that was taught in three (3) consecutive semesters. Several blended strategies were suggested and considered as effective interventions to further improve the teacher’s teaching techniques and the students’ learning skills working in a blended mode. The suggestions could also be used as guidelines to plan effective teaching and learning strategies in blended learning. © 2014 American Scientific Publishers.

The pedagogical planning within the blended learning environment with the users' quality of interaction (QoI) with the Learning Management System (LMS) is explored here. The required QoI (both for professors and students) is estimated by adopting a fuzzy logic-based modeling approach, namely FuzzyQoI, applied to LMS Moodle data from two undergraduate courses (i.e., Ergonomics and Psychomotor Rehabilitation) offered by a public higher education institution. In order to facilitate the understanding of the learning context and curricula organization of the both courses, the MindMup tool from the i-Treasures Pedagogical Planner (www.i-treasures.eu) is employed. The results presented can inspire LMS administrators to include the measure of QoI and reflect upon issues like system-quality, system-use and user-satisfaction into their current evaluation techniques of LMS based b-learning systems efficiency. © 2014 Springer International Publishing.","Blended-Learning Scenarios; Ergonomics and Psychomotor Rehabilitation courses; Fuzzy Logic-Based modelling; Human-Computer Interaction; i-Treasures; LMS Moodle; Pedagogical Planning; Quality of Interaction","Computer aided instruction; Curricula; Ergonomics; Fuzzy logic; Students; Teaching; Blended learning environments; Blended-Learning Scenarios; Higher education institutions; i-Treasures; Learning management system; LMS Moodle; Quality of interaction; Undergraduate Courses; Human computer interaction","Myers, B., Hollan, J., Cruz, I., Bryson, S., Bulterman, D., Catarci, T., Citrin, W., Wittenburg, K., Strategic directions in human-computer interaction (1996) ACM Computing Surveys (CSUR), 28 (4), pp. 794-809; Redecker, C., Ala-Mutka, K., Bacigalupo, M., Ferrari, A., Punie, Y., (2009) Learning 2.0: The Impact of Web 2.0 Innovations on Education and Training in Europe, , http://is.jrc.ec.europa.eu/pages/Learning-2.0.html; Pirani, Z., Sasikumar, M., Accessibility Issues in Learning Management Systems for Learning Disabled: A Survey (2014) AISC, 235, pp. 253-264. , Thampi, S.M., Abraham, A., Pal, S.K., Rodriguez, J.M.C.

This paper reports on an investigation into the use of a blended learning approach to teaching and learning of programming in a class of more than 200 students. A course and learning environment was designed by integrating constructivist learning models of Constructive Alignment, Conversational Framework and the Three-Stage Learning Model. Design science research is used for the course redesign and development of the learning environment, and action research is integrated to undertake participatory evaluation of the intervention. The action research involved the Students' Approach to Learning survey, a comparative analysis of students' performance, and qualitative data analysis of data gathered from various sources. The paper makes a theoretical contribution in presenting a design of a blended learning solution for large class teaching of programming grounded in constructivist learning theory and use of free and open source technologies. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","blended learning; constructivist learning; large class teaching; programming",,"Apple, D.K., Nelson, D., Identification of non-success factors in a large introductory computer science course and constructive interventions for increasing student success (2002) 32nd Annual Frontiers in Education, 2002.

In this study the BL approach to EFL teaching was defined as a combination of in-class and outside-of-class learning tasks and materials integrated in a single learning environment by a www-based courseware, ATR CALL BRIX (http://www.atr-lt.jp/products/brix/index.html). The use of the courseware outside of class was intended not only to help improve students' TOEIC scores, but also to nurture self-regulated learning (SRL). A student self-evaluation system was implemented in this project. On the basis of the findings of pre- and post-learning questionnaires and interviews with students, it was concluded that the self-evaluation system encouraged students to engage in SRL. Furthermore, pre- and post-TOEIC testing revealed that the students in the project improved their TOEIC scores (p < .01; r = .49). © 2014 Springer International Publishing.","Blended learning; E-mentoring; English as a foreign language (EFL); Self-evaluation system; Self-regulated learning","Computer aided instruction; E-learning; Education; Human computer interaction; Linguistics; Students; Surveys; Teaching; Blended learning; E-Mentoring; English-as-a-Foreign-Language; Self evaluation; Self-regulated learning; Engineering education","Osguthorpe, R.T., Graham, C.R., Blended Learning Environments: Definitions and Directions (2003) The Quarterly Review of Distance Education, 4 (3), pp. 227-233; Motteram, G., Sharma, P., Blending Learning in a Web 2.0 World (2009) International Journal of Emerging Technologies & Society, 7 (2), pp. 83-96; Zimmerman, B.J., Investigating Self-Regulation and Motivation: Historical Background, Methodological Developments, and Future Prospects (2008) American Educational Research Journal, 45, pp. 166-183; Nicol, D.J., Macfarlane-Dick, D., Formative Assessment and Self-Regulated Learning: A Model and Seven Principles of Good Feedback Practice (2006) Studies in Higher Education, 31 (2), pp. 199-218; Butler, D.L., Winne, P.H., Feedback and Self-Regulated Learning: A Theoretical Synthesis (1995) Review of Educational Research, 65 (3), pp. 245-281; Sadler, D.R., Formative Assessment and the Design of Instructional Systems (1989) Instructional Science, 18, pp. 119-144; Andrade, M.S., Bunker, E.L., A Model for Self-Regulated Distance Language Learning (2009) Distance Education, 30 (1), pp. 47-61; Miltiadou, M., Savenye, W.C., Applying Social Cognitive Constructs of Motivation to Enhance Student Success in Online Distance Education (2003) Educational Technology Review, 11 (1), pp. 1-28; Goda, Y., Formative Assessment and Support for Students' Self-Regulated Learning in E-learning (2012) Symposium Summary, 7, pp. 85-92; Wolters, C.A., Pintrich, P.R., Karabenic, S.A., Assessing Academic Self-Regulated Learning The Conference on Indicators of Positive Development: Definitions, Measures, and Prospective Validity (2003); Ng, C., Seeshing Yeung, A., Yuk Hung Hon, R., Does Online Language Learning Diminish Interaction between Student and Teacher?

Learning design for higher education can be challenging, especially in subjects with great quantities of theoretical material and where students have difficulties in linking theory with practice. This paper reports a case study in the nurse bachelor education, in which the subject studied is ""Organization, administration and management"". Former evaluations indicate great student dissatisfaction. The ways of teaching in this subject was dominated by lectures from one teacher and oral student presentations. Many students felt excluded and frustrated after class and could not relate the subject content to the hospital context. In this design we carry out experiments with Flipped Learning integrating Otto Scharmer's Theory U as a motivational pedagogical model to ensure quality and a meta perspective in linking theory into internship. The research design is inspired by action science research experiment and is ontologically embedded with practice as it employs participatory observation, focus group interviews as instruments to collect data. The learning experiment is based on blended learning theory and explores ways of creating motivational learning designs to enhance transfer. In a blended learning environment the teacher must create a community of inquiry and consider factors such as social, teaching and cognitive presence. This paper is an account of an investigation into how online activities combined with the principles of Flipped Learning can create and enhance motivation.","Blended learning; Collaboration; Flipped learning; Higher education; Inclusion; Motivation; Participation; Pedagogic; Theory u; Transfer","Computer aided instruction; Design; E-learning; Education; Education computing; Inclusions; Motivation; Nursing; Teaching; Blended learning; Collaboration; Flipped learning; Higher education; Participation; Pedagogic; Transfer; Students","Biesta, G., Et opgør med nyttetænkningen (2013) Unges motivation og læring : 12 eksperter om motivationskrisen i uddannelsessystemet, p. 268. , In N.U.

While TEL can provide many benefits for learners, many staff struggle to develop the skills and understanding necessary to design, develop and deliver high quality learning in these environments. Peer review of teaching and learning is acknowledged as a powerful professional learning tool for online and blended learning environments that can be utilised to assist staff to develop their skills in relation to teaching and learning. Peer review can be particularly powerful in recognising and addressing specific areas for professional learning about one's teaching practice. However, staff can find such approaches judgmental and focused on metrics and show reluctance to participate in such activities. There is also a view that once a development task such as peer review becomes formalised, the meaning of development is changed lessening the benefits of engagement in the process. This paper reports on a work in progress relating to a funded Australian Government Office of Learning and Teaching (OLT) project in two universities that piloted a reciprocal 'learning conversation' approach to peer review. This approach encourages the development of an ongoing dialogue around teaching and learning that goes beyond an exchange of facts and ideas and creates an opportunity for mutual and reciprocal learning - a collaborative as opposed to a developmental model of peer learning. The paper provides a definition of peer learning, examines the literature in relation to peer review of online teaching, and provides a rational for exploring ""learning conversations"" as an approach to peer review. It outlines the project features, processes, and progress to date.

Therefore, educational programs that offer alternative class meeting times and other flexible options are attractive to the nontraditional student. The purpose of this paper is to describe and demonstrate a model for a graduate program delivered by a hybrid, or blended, format. The model will be a master's degree program in exercise and nutrition science where the program is deli'mered through blending both face to face classroom learning and e-learning teaching methodologies. Challenges of development, lessons learned, and future recommendations will also be presented. This hybrid model is interdisciplinary and can be adapted and utilized across a variety of disciplines.","And blended learning; Hybrid; Technology","Blending; E-learning; Education; Education computing; Teaching; Technology; Blended learning; Classroom learning; E-learning teaching; Educational program; Graduate program; Hybrid; Non-traditional students; Program development; Students","Banergee, G., Blended environments: Learning effectiveness and student satisfaction at a small college in transition (2011) Journal of Asynchronous Learning Networks, 15 (1), pp. 8-19; Bonakdarian, E., Whittaker, T., Yang, Y., Mixing it up: Experiments in hybrid learning (2010) Journal of Computing Sciences in Colleges, 25 (4), pp. 97-103; Kenney, J., Newcornbe, E., Adopting a blended learning approach: Challenges encountered and lessons learned in an action research study (2011) Journal of Asynchronous Learning Networks, 15 (1), pp. 45-57; Kim, K., Bonk, C., (2006) The Future of Online Teaching and Learning in Higher Education: The Survey Says EDUCA USE Quarterly, 4, pp. 22-30; Lee, R., Dashew, B., Designed learner interactions in blended course delivery (2011) Journal of Asynchronous Learning Networks, 15 (1), pp. 68-76. , Feb; Liu, Y., Tourtellott, M., Blending at small colleges: Challenges and solutions (2011) Journal of Asynchronous Learning Networks, 15 (1), pp. 58-67. , Feb; Napier, N., Dekhane, S., Smith, S., Transitioning to blended learning: Understanding student and faculty perceptions (2011) Journal of Asynchronous Learning Networks, 15 (1), pp. 20-32; Vaughan, N., Perspectives on blended learning in higher education (2007) International Journal on ELearning, , http://www.thefreelibrarv.com//print/PrintArticle.aspx?id-l59594390",,9781941763063,,"English",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84923272455

However, many university teachers are having difficulties in designing effective learning instructions or activities for a flipped course. Aiming to explore the validity of the flipped learning concept in a higher education context, an innovative flipped course was designed and implemented using an advanced learning platform to create a holistic flipped classroom environment. A survey, an interview, and computer system logs were used to evaluate the effectiveness of such a pedagogical method. It was found that the 'Holistic Flipped Classroom' approach was effective: students reported that they were satisfied with the course, their attendance improved, and their study efforts increased. It was also found that the transactional distance changed during the learning process: highly motivated students performed much better comparatively than less motivated ones. Although this approach has shown positive results, some students retained their former passive learning habits, and this became the main obstruction to full adoption. Finally, for the practitioner, case examples and suggestions are provided to address the design, implementation and adoption issues. © 2014 IEEE.","Blended learning; holistic flipped classroom; transactional distance","Curricula; Design; Students; Blended learning; Classroom environment; Design and evaluations; Effective learning; holistic flipped classroom; Pedagogical method; Transactional distance; University teachers; Teaching","Ash, K., Educators view 'flipped' mode with a more critical eye (2012) Education Week, , Aug. 29; Bergmann, J., Sams, A., Flip your classroom: Reach every student in every class every day (2012) Internal Society for Technology in Education, pp. 7-17; Bonwell, C.C., Eison, J.A., Active Learning: Creating excitement in the classroom (1991) Higher Education Reports; Caulfield, J., (2011) How to Design and Teach A Hybrid Course, pp. 19-26. , Stylus Publishing; Chen, N.-S., Ko, H.-C., Kinshuk, Lin, T., A model for synchronous learning using the Internet (2005) Innovations in Education and Teaching International, 42 (2), pp. 181-194. , May; Chen, N.-S., Wang, Y., Testing principles of language learning in a cyber face-to-face environment (2008) Educational Technology & Society, 11 (3), pp. 97-113; Chen, N.-S., Tsai, C.-C., Knowledge infrastructure of the future (2009) Educational Technology & Society, 12 (1), pp. 1-4; Chen, N.-S., Ko, L., An online synchronous test for professional interpreters (2010) Educational Technology & Society, 13 (2), pp. 153-165; Hamdan, N., McKnigh, P., McKnight, K., Arfstrom, K., The flipped learning model: A white paper based on the leterature review (2013) Flipped Learning Network; Hamdan, N., McKnight, P., McKnight, K., Arfstrom, K., A review of flipped learning, george mason university, pearson's center for educator effectiveness (2013) Flipped Learning Network; Hastie, M., Chen, N.-S., Kuo, Y.-H., Instructional designfor best practice in the synchronous cyber classroom (2007) Educational Technology & Society, 10 (4), pp. 281-294; Hastie, M., Hung, I.-C., Chen, N.-S., Kinshuk, A blended synchronous learning model for educational international collaborations (2010) Innovations in Education and Teaching International, 47 (1), pp. 9-24. , February; Kaleta, R., Garnham, C., Hybrid I: UW system hybrid course project-overview, faculty development, student resources (2001) Proceedings of the 17th Annual Conference on Distance Teaching and Learning, , University of Wisconsin-Madison; Moore, M.G., Kearsley, G., (1996) Research on Effectiveness, Distance Education: A Systems Review, , Belmont, CA: Wadsworth; Pintrich, P., Schunk, D., (1996) Motivation in education: Theory, research and applications, , Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice Hall; Staker, H., Horn, M., (2012) Classifying K-12 Blended Learning, , Innosight Institute; Teng, E.D.-C., Chen, N.-S., Kinshuk, L.T., Exploring students' learning experience in an international online research seminar in the Synchronous Cyber Classroom (2012) Computers & Education, 58, pp. 918-930; Tucker, B., The flipped classroom (2012) Education Next, (WINTER); Wang, Y., Chen, N.-S., Levy, M., Teacher training in a synchronous cyber face-to-face classroom: Characterizing and supporting the online teachers' learning process (2010) Computer Assisted Language Learning, 23 (4), pp. 277-293. , October; Wang, Y., Chen, N.-S., Levy, M., The design and implementation of a holistic training model for language teacher education in a cyber face-to-face learning environment (2010) Computers and Education, 55 (2), pp. 777-788; Wang, Y., Chen, N.-S., The collaborative language learning attributes of cyber face-to-face interaction: The perspectives of the learner (2012) Interactive Learning Environments, 20 (4), pp. 311-330",,9781479940387,,"English",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84910058637

In the field of pre-service teacher education, a rising challenge is to equip the ""21st century teacher"" with the necessary toolset of skills and competencies to grapple with the idiosyncrasies of the new generation of ""millenials"". To this purpose, what still remains an open issue is the degree of innovation afforded by specific e-learning designs, in a field where traditional teacher training pedagogies co-exist with e-learning-specific ones. This article proposes a synthesis of two models, the Community of Inquiry (COI) model, based on the Practical Inquiry model introduced by Garrison, Anderson, & Archer (2000) and the Learning by Design framework (LbyD), based on the conceptualization of 'New Learning', articulated by Kalantzis & Cope (2012). Both models were invented with new learning styles and circumstances in mind. The proposed synthesis guided the design of the six-month introductory course in Technology Enhanced Learning by the School of Pedagogical and Technological Education (ASPETE) research team (located in Athens) and implemented with 18 pre service student-teachers at the Higher Education Technological Institute (TEI) of Lamia, located in another geographical area of Greece. In this context, elements of the COI framework were employed as tools both for designing and for evaluating the contents, structure and activities of the e-learning course. Two elements of the framework, teaching and cognitive presence were the axes supporting the course structure, whilst the kinds of activities most promoted were discussion, collaboration and reflection. The LbyD framework functioned as an awareness enhancement mechanism for trainee teachers to formulate, collaboratively negotiate and finally articulate and support pedagogical scenarios integrating the meaningful use of technology. The discussion of this experience is supported by a dataset including students' answers to a COI-based survey, free-text student feedback and asynchronous discussion transcripts, providing evidence about the potential of the approach and pointing out issues that need to be improved. © ACPIL.","Blended learning; Community of inquiry; Course design; Learning design; Online teacher training",,"Abbit, J., Ophus, J., What we know about the Impacts of Web-Quests: A review of research (2008) AACE Journal, 16 (4), pp. 441-456; Anderson, T., Rourke, L., Garrison, D.R., Archer, W., Assessing teaching presence in a computer conference context (2001) Journal of Asynchronous Learning Networks, 5. , http://www.sloanc.org/publications/jaln/v5n2/pdf/v5n2_anderson.pdf, available at: last access: 13/5/2013; Barnett, M., Issues and trends concerning electronic networking technologies for teacher professional development: A critical review of the literature (2002), paper presented at the annual meeting of American Educational Research Association, New Orleans; Bates, A., Computer-assisted learning or communications: Which way for information technology in distance education?

Design/methodology/approach – This paper employs a quantitative and qualitative approach where data were sourced from a third year finance unit across one semester using a survey instrument. SPSS v20 was used to perform basic descriptive analysis. Findings – The study revealed that by providing an online learning community through the use of Blackboard Collaborate! significantly enhances transactional engagement beyond the classroom. In particular the use of Blackboard Collaborate! allowed the teacher to be more accessible, supportive, expect and support high standards and provide challenging activities that generated rich and meaningful interactions and promoted higher order thinking skills. Research limitations/implications – The positive results emanating from this study may encourage other educators and their institutions to adopt a synchronous online learning community to enhance student’s engagement levels and increase the quality of student learning and their university experience. This study was conducted at only one university so it may not be feasible to form generalisations resulting from the findings. Originality/value – This study adds new insights towards the scarce amount of literature on engagement in a blended learning environment. In particular the study adds a student perspective to the student engagement literature and to what constitutes quality in higher education and/or improved student experience. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Blackboard Collaborate!; Online learning community; Synchronous e-learning; Transactional engagement",,"Bryson, C., Hand, L., The role of engagement in inspiring teaching and learning (2007) Innovations in Education and Teaching International, 44 (4), pp. 349-362; Calder, A., Peer interaction in the transition process (2004) Journal of the Australian and New Zealand Student Services Association, 23, pp. 4-16; Chang, V., Fisher, D., The validation and application of a new learning environment instrument to evaluate online learning in higher education (2001) Australian Association for <Checkcomponent>Research in Education Conference</Checkcomponent>, , www.aare.edu.au/, 2 May, Fremantle, WA, accessed 18 January 2014; Chen, P., Lambert, A., Guidry, K., Engaging online learners: The impact of web-based learning technology on college student engagement (2010) Computer &Amp; Education, 54 (4), pp. 1222-1232; Chin, G., Carroll, J., Articulating collaboration in a learning community (2000) Behaviourand Information Technology, 19 (4), pp. 233-245; Coates, H., A model of online and general campus-based student engagement (2007) Assessment and Evaluation in Higher Education, 33 (2), pp. 121-141; Coates, H., Hillman, K., Jackson, D., Tan, L., Daws, A., Rainsford, D., Murphy, M., (2008) Attracting, Engaging and Retaining: New Conversations about Learning.

With this research-in-progress, we therefore propose a conceptual framework for a blended learning flipped classroom to redesign large-scale IS lectures, recognize the important role of peers in the student journey, and improve interaction. We therefore derive requirements from the theory of interaction for flipped classrooms. These requirements are addressed by design principles for flipped classrooms and implemented in a large-scale IS lecture. With the implementation, we are able to overcome large-scale lecture related limitations, and, as a practical contribution, help IS lecturers to face the according challenges. As a theoretical contribution, we enrich the body of large-scale learning-teaching-environments by considering explicitly the role of peers. The study is currently running in order to evaluate the concept.","Collaborative learning; Flipped classroom; Interaction; Large-scale lectures; Learning success; Peer assessment; Peer creation; Peer learning","Information systems; Students; Collaborative learning; Flipped classroom; Interaction; Large-scale lectures; Learning success; Peer assessment; Peer creation; Peer learning; Teaching","Alavi, M., Marakas, G.M., Yoo, Y., A comparative study of distributed learning environments on learning outcomes (2002) Information Systems Research, 13 (4), pp. 404-415; Alonso, F., Manrique, D., Viñes, J.M., A moderate constructivist e-learning instructional model evaluated on computer specialists (2009) Computers & Education, 53 (1), pp. 57-65; Arbaugh, J.B., How instructor immediacy behaviors affect student satisfaction and learning in web-based courses (2001) Business Communication Quarterly, 64 (4), pp. 42-54; Arbaugh, J.B., (2010) Online and Blended Business Education for the 21st Century: Current Research and Future Directions, , Woodhead Publishing; Bischof, L., (2013) Die Digitale (R) Evolution?

Using Rogers theory of perceived attributes, this paper provides a research framework that identifies the attributes for BL adoption in a social group comprising of (N=246) potential adopter undergraduate engineering students. Using Bass model the study also accounts for the interinfluence of related group of potential adopter faculties who are likely to exert positive influence on students. The results revealed that acceptance of BL as an innovation and its learning outcomes are strongly associated with innovation attributes like Relative Advantage, Compatibility, Ease of Use, Department and Faculty support. Learning outcomes are very positive under BL when compared to PL, though within BL, ordering of PL and VL was not significant. For certain innovation attributes gender differences were significant. Overall students expressed much more positive attitude to adopt BL model for learning than using only PL. © Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering 2014.","Blended learning; Engineering; Experiments; Innovation diffusion; Interinfluence; Virtual labs","Developing countries; Engineering; Engineering education; Laboratories; Students; Blended learning; Innovation attributes; Innovation diffusion; Interinfluence; Research frameworks; Science experiments; Undergraduate engineering students; Virtual lab; Experiments","Mikropoulos, T.A., Natsis, A., Educational virtual environments: A ten-year review of empirical research (1999-2009) (2011) Comput.

Over the recent years the school equipped with 100 personal computers and 28 iPads has become one of the leading e-learning schools in Austria. iPads show their advantages in the context of blended learning sequences: the devices are instantly ready to use and allow pure haptic interaction with the content. The iPad appeals with its simple interface and very stable operating system. It encourages teachers to implement e-learning with the usage of ebooks into their lessons. Significant differences between ebooks as pdf format, epub format and ibook format are evident in the integration of interactive elements: only ibooks support the integration of various interactive objects beside basic functionalities like the use of dictionaries and tagging tools. This format of ibooks meets the demands of teachers and pupils in ebooks in almost every point with the disadvantage that they are available only for iPads. The creation of ebooks goes smoothly with the use of the software pages available for Mac OS and iOS, which is appropriate for the epub format, the production of interactive ibooks succeeds with the software iBooks Author available only for Mac OS. The evaluation of this paper was done with the feedback tools of the learning platform Moodle asking students about their views. Through two e-lectures with teachers and a presentation at the national conference called ""Tablet User Days 2013"" at the Pedagogical University in Melk, a validation of this work was accomplished. © 2014 IADIS.","Competence- based science teaching; E-learning; Ebooks; Mobile - learning; Tablets","E-learning; Education; Electronic publishing; Personal computers; E-books; Haptic interactions; Interactive elements; Interactive objects; Learning platform; Mobile Learning; Science teaching; Tablets; Teaching","Bönsch, (2010) Kompetenzorientierter Unterricht.

Key challenges faced by this work are how best to support educational and social interactions, how to deliver personalised tuition, and how to enable effective feedback, all in a way which is potentially scalable to thousands of users. A case study is described involving one to one and group music lessons in an on-campus, face to face, higher education context that were observed and analysed in terms of the actions carried out by the participants. The actions are described and it is shown how they can be formalised into a flowchart which represents the social interactions and activities within a lesson. Through this analysis, specific scenarios emerged where the feedback being given might not be effective, e.g. the recipient not understanding the feedback or the provision of feedback which is not specific enough. In answer to these scenarios of ineffective feedback, the requirements for a technological intervention which aims to make the feedback more effective are proposed. With this in mind, we are then able to describe a novel technological platform which has been developed as part of a large-scale European research project and which aims to support effective feedback. The platform is based around focused discussion of time based media, embedded within existing teaching activities at a research led higher education institution in the UK. We outline how it is being used in a blended learning model to support the teaching and learning of music. We reflect on the experience of developing techniques and systems for enabling communities of elearning and describe our evaluation methodology which involves several, ongoing case studies and approximately 400 users in its current phase.

The findings are based on a learner corpus (299 postings within 8 discussion threads) compiled from two discussion tasks which were a part of a blended learning EFL course. The participants were Czech university students in the EFL course. Their proficiency in English was slightly below the fully developed CEFR A2 level. Conversation analysis (CA) was conducted on the corpus. The inductive and emic nature of CA made it possible to uncover some specific mechanisms underlying the learners' interaction on the forum. The results presented in this paper are related to non-verbal aspects of the learners' interaction on the forum, particularly to the use of ellipsis marks (i.e. multiple dots). It was discovered that ellipsis marks were used for listing, transition, personal evaluation, referring to the previous posting and asking for response when taking leave, thus ranging from non-interactive uses functioning on a sentence level to highly interactive uses which co-constructed exchanges on the forum. One of the most interesting findings is that when used at the end of a posting which included (explicitly or implicitly) a question or a request for answer, the posting was always replied to. On the other hand, when ellipsis marks were used at the end of a posting presenting one's opinion, the posting was never replied to. We interpret the latter use of ellipsis marks as completing the evaluation. The findings are related to other research findings and it is concluded that interaction on a discussion forum presents a specific platform, differing from speech or writing. The relevance of the paper to foreign language teaching and ICT in education lies in the outcomes of the analysis, i.e. the description of different uses of ellipsis marks in online interaction. The findings cast light on the nature of learner-learner interaction in a foreign language and on the ways of their utilizing ellipsis marks to express a wide range of meanings. More generally, this paper discusses how ellipsis marks helped the learners' reach mutual understanding, i.e. intersubjectivity. Thus the paper contributes to the theoretical grasp of online learner-learner interaction in English as a foreign language.","Computer-mediated communication; Conversation analysis; Discussion forum; Ellipsis marks; English as a foreign language; Interaction","Computational linguistics; E-learning; Social networking (online); Computer mediated communication; Conversation analysis; Discussion forum; Ellipsis marks; English-as-a-Foreign-Language; Interaction; Teaching","(2001) Common European framework of reference for languages: Learning, teaching, assessment, , Council of Europe; Crystal, D., (2011) Internet linguistics: A student guide, , Routledge, Oxon; Dresner, E., Herring, S.C., Functions of the nonverbal in CMC: Emoticons and illocutionary force (2010) Communication Theory, 20 (3), pp. 249-268; Drew, P., Heritage, J., Analyzing talk at work: An introduction (1992) Talk at work.

This very system requires qualitative enhancements and changes regarding education, research and evaluation. In order to support the teacher in his pedagogic and scientific activities, the Ministry of Higher Education has initiated the Distance Learning National Project (DLNP) which aims at integrating Information and Communication Technologies in Education (ICTE) through both videoconference and e-learning. Substantial investments have enabled universities to acquire highperformance hardware. As for the human support, technical and pedagogic trainings have been provided, the context in which we have benefited from several trainings in e-learning. Insofar as the integration of ICTE is an iterative process, in perpetual development, that gets better according to its evolution, a decade after launching this DLNP, what about the practice? Was there any generalization of e-learning in the universities? Were the teachers ready for this change? Is this change adapted and adaptable to the socio-economic environment of the Algerian university? How to generalize its practice to adapt it to our specific needs? It is to these questions that we will attempt to give answers in this paper using data from an experiment about an e-learning training on information management. We followed the principle of iterative and incremental development approach which is based on the evolution of the training design in stages (pre-project study, contents design, educational scenarios development, tests and evaluation of the training). The experimentation has underlined strong points (tutorial system, courses structuring and presenting, activities, adequacy between the training content and its objective) as well as weak ones (lack of learning autonomy for learners and bad time management, bureaucratic and technical problems). A critical analysis of this experimentation led us to make some concrete proposals for a better integration of ICTE. As for the potential human resource (especially students, teachers and administrative managers), it's necessary to make them aware, to inform and train them yet always by assisting them. From the technical standpoint, many initiatives are already under way (fit out all the classrooms with video projectors, some classrooms have computers for each student), whereas training teachers, especially for the collaborative work, is the main aspect to take into account.

Online SN work in close association with offline SN to form a blended social environment that greatly enables and enhances students' learning. Some Schools of Architecture have struggled or failed to engage in the potential of SN or their respective University's online Learning Management Systems (LMS). Despite efforts to facilitate blended learning environments or to engage students in problem-based learning activities architectural education often fails to tap into the rich resources that online social learning environments offers through their collective and social intelligence of its users. This paper proposes a framework for SN architectural education that provides opportunities for linking the academic LMS with private or professional SN such that it enhances the learning experience and deepens the knowledge of the students. The paper proposes ways of utilising SN supported learning environments in other areas of the curriculum and concludes with directions of how this framework can be employed in professional settings.","Architectural curriculum; Social learning; Social networks",,"Alexander, B., Web 2.0: A new wave of innovation for teaching and learning?

Currently, thanks to the advances in communication and computer networks and the evolution of programming languages, new eLearning tools have emerged that enable the usage of learning methodologies such as blended learning and distance learning. One of them is the remote Web laboratory. A remote Web laboratory is an application which allows students to work with real hardware or instruments. To do this, students only need a computer with an Internet connection. However, emerging technologies and other hardware such as mobile devices, cloud computing and the Internet of Things, require the design of different models to support innovative learning experiences. For this reason, remote labs are being reconsidered to smart device paradigm. Physically, the considered smart device is made of the junction of a controller (computer server) connected to physical equipment on the one hand, and to the Internet on the other hand.

As a significant percentage of students do not have sufficient mathematical skills, universities often utilise blended learning courses to increase these skills prior to the start of studies. Due to the diversity of students and their educational backgrounds, individual strategies are needed to achieve the necessary competence for successfully managing their studies. This paper describes our approach at the University of Applied Sciences Ruhr West, where we are using personalized blended learning concepts based on the measurement of individual mathematical competences at the beginning of a coaching process. This is used to gain a better matching between the individual learner level and the adapted learning concepts. We combine individual presence learning groups and a personalized e-learning environment. This environment is adapted based on mathematical skills of each student. It uses individual learning advices, short-term optical feedback and up to date e-learning material in a Moodle-based LMS (learning management system). The coaching concept is approved by the results of summative and formative evaluations.","Blended Learning; Bridging Courses; Mathematical Coaching; Personalization","Blended learning; Bridging course; Formative evaluation; Learning management system; Mathematical Coaching; Personalizations; Personalized e-learning; University of applied science; Computer aided instruction; E-learning; Feedback; Students","Ayad Khaled, A.A., (2010) The Role of Edutainment in E-learning - An Empirical Study, , PhD Thesis, De Montfort University; Bhattacharya, M., Hartnett, M., Addressing diversity in design of online courses (2008) BCcampus and Common Wealth of Learning; CharAt (Version 1.0)[Computer Software], , http://www.charamel.com/, Cologne, Germany: Charamel GmbH.

Applications from games to augmented reality are thriving in research settings, and in some cases schools and universities, but relatively little is known about how such devices may be used for effective learning. This article discusses the selection and potential use of electronic games, simulations and augmented reality in mobile learning supported by an operational model called AIDLET. After analyzing the different approaches to the use of digital technology and games in education, and discussing their benefits and shortcomings, a framework was developed to facilitate the selection, repurposing, design and implementation of games, simulations and augmented reality, with focus on the practical aspects of the processes used in mobile learning. It is apparent that these devices for learning are valued by students and teachers alike, and that they may be used as personalized devices for amplifying learning, specifically through amplifying access to information, social networks, and ability to participate in the world. Furthermore, whereas traditional learning is based on knowledge memorization and the completion of carefully graded assignments, today, games, simulations and virtual environments turn out to be safe platforms for trial and error experimentation, i.e. learning by doing or playing. In this context, the AIDLET model was set out and verified against a taxonomy representing the main categories and genres of games, and the article concludes with implications for how teachers, instructional designers and technologists might best capitalize on the affordances of mobile devices when designing for blended learning and e-learning courses. © 2013, IGI Global.","AIDLET Model; Augmented Reality; e-Learning; Games; Mobile Learning; Simulations",,"Anderson, T., Teaching in an online learning context (2008) Theory and Practice of Online Learning, pp. 343-366. , In T.

The first benefit would be the access to educational resources, independent of location and time. With the wide spread of mobile technologies, from mobile phones and tablets that support content distribution, social media communication and collaboration, to teaching methods and technologies, teaching and learning must be adapted to these new challenges in online higher education. Therefore, courses must be redesigned and structured in order to be accessible to individual study. The paper is focused on developing a template for online courses, starting from designing the main learning objects as resources and activities, including teaching materials, online assessments, questionnaires and communication-interaction tools such as webinars, forums and chat. As a good practice example, we present the results from the application of a course evaluation questionnaire, in terms of structure, content, interaction between participants. Based on these results a comparative analysis is made between online and blended learning, regarding the fact that there are a lot of constraints that affect the way blended courses are developed, which can compromise their quality. In conclusion, we present the main benefits of using this method of learning. As future work, we make some remarks about improvements regarding the system and methods. © 2013 IEEE.","blended learning; course template; e-learning","Blended learning; Comparative analysis; Content distribution; course template; Educational resource; Implementation models; On-line assessment; Teaching and learning; Communication; Curricula; Electrical engineering; Engineering education; Quality control; Surveys; Teaching; Virtual reality; E-learning","Lewis, D., Chen, E., Factors Leading to a Quality E-Learning Experience (2010) Online Education and Adult Learning: New Frontiers for Teaching Practice, , T.

Reliable and robust infrastructure must be in place to support students and faculty. Continuous evaluation can effectively track the impact of blended learning on students, faculty, and the institution. These data are used to inform stakeholders and impact policy to improve faculty development and other support structures necessary for success. This iterative loop of continuous quality improvement is augmented by faculty scholarship of teaching and learning research. The evolution of blended learning at the University of Central Florida is used as a model and research collected over sixteen years illustrates that with proper support and planning, blended learning can result in positive institutional transformation. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.","Blended learning; Institutional support; Student agency; Student rating of instruction; Student success","Societies and institutions; Students; Teaching; Blended learning; Continuous quality improvement; Faculty development; Institutional support; Institutional transformation; Scholarship of teaching and learning; Student success; University of Central Florida; Education","Allen, E., Seaman, J., Going the distance: Online education in the United States, 2011 (2011) The Sloan Consortium, , Sloan-C Needham, MA; Ambient Insight, 2011 learning and performance technology research taxonomy (2011), Ambient Insight Monroe, WA; Blended Learning Toolkit, (2012), http://blended.online.ucf.edu/, Retrieved March 20, 2012 from; Bonk, C.J., Olson, T.M., Wisher, R.A., Orvis, K.L., Learning from focus groups: An examination of blended learning (2002) Journal of Distance Education, 17 (3), pp. 97-118; Breiman, L., Friedman, J.H., Olshen, R.A., Stone, C.J., Classification and regression trees (1984), Wadsworth Blemont, CA; Center for Distributed Learning Awards, (2012), http://cdl.ucf.edu/home/awards-page/, Retrieved March 20, 2012 from; Chang, L., Dziuban, C.D., Hynes, M.C., Olson, A.H., Does a standard reflect minimal competency of examinees or judge competency?

MAgAdI is an adaptive web environment devoted to supporting the learning processes in overall contexts, in which several knowledge fields, courses and teachers are involved. So far, a three-year cyclical evaluation-improvement process has been developed on several subjects and participants (n = 80) of a Computer Science degree programme. This process embraced formative and summative evaluation phases with the aim of: discovering the implications of the blended-learning loop on the satisfaction of teachers and motivation of students confirming improvements in student learning; and testing the usability of the Student Workspace. Experimental data were collected by means of a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods. Results of this study detect improvements in the students' acquisition of knowledge in the three phases where it was evaluated (Wilcoxon-test, p = 0.02, p = 0.048, p = 0.044), which may be attributable to the use of MAgAdI. In addition, increments in student's motivation and teacher's satisfaction were also perceived. Thus, these results agree with previous findings of related works. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Integrating face-to-face and online learning, blending can enhance learning and optimize seat time. This paper describes the use of the blended e-learning model in a course ""Data Structures and Algorithms"" given at the Afyon Kocatepe University, Turkey. This model is realized as a combination of a face-to-face environment and online learning, using the University's Learning Management System (LMS) named @KU-UZEM. The LMS consists of many applications in accordance with SCORM standards, such as, student records, user roles, courses, exams security applications, student affairs, counseling services, internal communication, director processes and evaluation. It provides whole software infrastructure by a virtual academic institution and is currently used in Afyon Kocatepe University. This paper describes both the technology for course design and programme redesign adopted a blended learning approach with both face-to-face and online learning aimed at enhancing the students' control over their own learning. According to the obtained results with the performed experimental evaluation, the realized blended learning model provided more effective and efficient educational experience rather than traditional, face-to-face learning. A survey conducted at the end of the course also showed that students were satisfied with the pedagogical approach, and their academic achievements were also better than expected. Particularly important is that the dropout rate was greatly diminished, which could be related to students' satisfaction with the support they received from the teacher and the system. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","blended learning; e-learning; educational technology; learning management system (LMS); web-based education system","Blended learning; Educational experiences; Experimental evaluation; Internal communications; Learning management system; Software infrastructure; Students' satisfaction; Web-based education systems; Blending; Computer programming; Curricula; Data structures; Education computing; Educational technology; Engineering education; Students; Teaching; E-learning","McCormack, C., Jones, D., (1997) Building A Web-based Education System, , Wiley, New York; Hoic-Bozic, N., Vornar, V., Boticki, I., A blended learning approach to course design and implementation (2009) IEEE Trans Educ, 52, pp. 19-30; Greenberg, G., Distance education technologies: Best practices for K-12 settings (1998) IEEE Technol Soc Mag, 17, pp. 36-40; Passerini, K., Granger, M.J., A developmental model for distance learning using the Internet (2000) Comput Educ, 34, pp. 1-15; Keegan, D., (2004) Foundations of Distance Education, , Routledge, New York; Kaya, Z., (2002) Distance Education, , PegemA, Ankara; Akkoyunlu, B., Soylu, M., A study on students' views on blended learning environment (2006) Turk Online J Dist Educ, 7, pp. 43-56; Clark, R.T., Mayer, R.E., (2003) E-learning and the Science of Instruction, , Pfeiffer, San Francisco; (2007) Communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament: The E-Learning Action Plan, , http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/site/en/com/2001/com2001_0172en01.pdf, European Commission, (Mar. 2001), Nov; Berge, Z.L., Yi-Ping, H., (2004) A Model for Sustainable Student Retention: A Holistic Perspective on the Student Dropout Problem with Special Attention to E-learning, , http://www.ed.psu.edu/acsde/deos/deosnews/deosnews13_5.pdf, DEOSNEWS, 13, no. 5, May; Developing on-line collaboration (2000) Web-based Learning and Teaching Technologies - Opportunities and Challenges, pp. 226-244. , E.

The present article reports the development and testing of a novel questionnaire on 'approaches to e-teaching', which may be employed to investigate the experience of teaching when e-learning is involved. Results showed suitable reliability and validity. Also, when exploring associations between the novel questionnaire scales and those of the well-known 'approaches to teaching' inventory (Prosser and Trigwell, 2006), results from correlation and cluster analyses suggest that student-focused approaches to teaching are needed for significant use of digital technology to emerge. For practice, this relevant outcome implies that teaching needs to be considered holistically when supporting teachers to incorporate e-learning in their practice: because it seems they approach online teaching coherently with the face-to-face side of the blended experience. © 2013 Vilnius University.","Approaches to teaching; E-learning; E-teaching; Higher education.",,"Biggs, J., Kember, D., Leung, D.Y.P., The revised two-factor study process questionnaire: R-SPQ-2F (2001) British Journal of Educational Psychology, 71, pp. 133-149; Bliuc, A.M., Ellis, R., Goodyear, P., Piggott, L., Learning through face-to-face and online discussions: associations between students' conceptions, approaches and academic performance in political science (2010) British Journal of Educational Technology, 41 (3), pp. 512-524; Bliuc, A.M., Ellis, R.A., Goodyear, P., Piggott, L., A blended learning approach to teaching foreign policy: student experiences of learning through face-to-face and online discussion and their relationship to academic performance (2011) Computers and Education, 56 (3), pp. 856-864; Bowden, J.A., Walsh, E., (2000) Phenomenography, , Melbourne, RMIT University Press; DeVellis, R.F., (2003) Scale Development: Theory and Applications 2nd edn, , Thousand Oaks, Calif., Sage Publications, Inc; Ellis, R., Ginns, P., Piggott, L., E-learning in higher education: some key aspects and their relationship to approaches to study (2009) Higher Education Research and Development, 28 (3), pp. 303-318; Ellis, R., Goodyear, P., (2010) Students' Experiences of E-Learning in Higher Education.

The authors describe how blended learning can form an attractive and helpful framework for assisting Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing (D-HH) students to learn and communicate. The described blended learning experiment integrates face-to-face, synchronous, and asynchronous e-learning, bilingual teaching (oral language and Sign Language) in the mainstream class, teaching in parallel classes, and personalized access to distributed databases of educational material. At the core of PELE, the authors use Multimedu, a web-based tailored made tool for disabled students. This experimental tool includes applications of a traditional Learning Management System (LMS), supporting a multilingual dictionary of terms, multimedia management and social networking.

We present the outcomes of an experimental study carried out during the academic years 2007/2008 and 2008/2009 with engineering students at the University of Salamanca (Spain). In the present research, as we have done in previous ones, we have selected a subject which is common to the four degrees under consideration: Computer Science. This study explores in greater depth the validity of experimental designs coming from educational research and the impact of innovative teaching methodologies. The hypothesis that impulses this research is formulated to ascertain that the learning level and the satisfaction of students will be higher after the implementation of new teaching methodologies (based on constructive learning, collaborative work, and blended learning resources), than in more traditional teaching contexts. The obtained results partially confirm this hypothesis. The ultimate purpose of this work is that of providing evidence that contributes to the improvement of education and teaching methods for a better performance of students in engineering. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The expectations are quite basic ones, although may depend on the educational level: support to content sharing and production, communication, assessment and team working are at the top of rank; much less relevant appear to be items like: support to socialization, process design and personalization. Very similar results have been obtained also from a survey among schools' teachers, novices for TEE, attending a Master in ""e-learning: methods, techniques and applications"". The survey was conducted after the conclusion of the first part of the master carried on according to a very traditional distance learning process: content download, self-evaluation tests, tutor assistance upon request. However, after the participation to the second part of the Master, organized as a collaborative, design inspired P3BL (problem, project and process based learning) experience, their opinions on TEE changed in a considerable manner. This indicates how necessary a dissemination action on a large scale among educators with regard to both TEE potentialities and design literacy would be. © 2013 by IGI Global.

The process of the course design improvement is described; the current model is presented in detail, underlining the advantages of blended approach for CLIL: parallels between effective CLIL didactics and blended learning tools are discussed, methodological approach to course design is explained. The aim of this case study is to discuss the possibilities of blended learning for CLIL teacher training, offering the students' perspective based on complex feedback survey. The paper aims especially at teacher-training course designers and CLIL practitioners. CLIL refers to situations where ""subjects, or parts of subjects, are taught through a foreign language with dual-focused aims, namely the learning of content, and the simultaneous acquisition of a foreign language"" (Marsh and Langé 1999). For an effective CLIL class, teacher qualification is essential. The design of our course stems from current research on CLIL teacher-training, national methodological handbook for e-learning in higher education, and the syllabi of regular Didactics of Mathematics courses. We conclude that the CLIL teacher training course needs to expand the teachers' didactic skills palette by teaching compensation strategies, focusing on multimodality, and incorporating language-teaching strategies in Mathematics lessons. The course design is continuously developing based on latest experience; it has also become a compulsory subject for Mathematics teacher trainees. The blended model of the course allows the teachers to cater to the language aspect of CLIL more effectively, and especially to illustrate CLIL methodology on two levels: as the content of the course and also via the methods employed to teach this content. Blended learning seems to suit both Czech students and Erasmus students who take part in the course.","Blended learning course; CLIL; Content and language integrated learning; Course design; Course development; Teacher training","Curricula; Design; E-learning; Mathematical techniques; Personnel training; Students; Blended learning; CLIL; Course design; Course development; Integrated learning; Teacher training; Teaching","Dlouhá, J., Braniš, M., Dlouhý, J., Jančaříková, K., Jančařík, A., Šauer, P., Metodika tvorby textů v otevřeném internetovém prostoru pro vysokoškolské vzdělávání formou e-learningu, Centrum pro otázky životního prostředí (2010), Univerzity Karlovy v Praze, Praha; Jančařík, A., Jančaříková, K., Wiki Tools in the Preparation and Support of e-Learning Courses (2010) Electronic Journal of e-Learning, 8 (2), pp. 123-132; Kupetz, R., Ziegenmeyer, B., Blended learning in a teacher training course: Integrated interactive e-learning and contact learning (2005) ReCALL, 17, pp. 179-196; Marsh, D., Lange, G., Implementing Content and Language Integrated Learning (1999), Continuing Education Centre/TIECLIL, Finland; Marsh, D., Mehisto, P., Wolff, D., Frigols Martín, M.J., The European Framework for CLIL Teacher Education (2010), http://clil-cd.ecml.at/Portals/24/flashfiles/index3.html, [online]; Milne, E.D., Llinares, A., Morton, T., CLIL across Contexts: A Scaffolding Framework for CLIL Teacher Education (2010) Current Research on CLIL, 3 (12), pp. 12-20; Novotná, J., Hadj-Moussová, Z., Hofmannová, M., Teacher training for CLIL - competences of a CLIL teacher (2001) Proceedings SEMT 01, pp. 122-126. , in M.

This becomes particularly significant during the introductory phase of highly mathematical degree programs such as engineering sciences. Thus, based on the example of a fundamentals of electrical engineering course, the authors developed a blended learning scenario which facilitates imparting mathematical expertise within the situated context of this specialist subject. A critical element of this approach is the abundant use of interactive web application-based 3D visualizations. This allows for clarifying complex mathematical problem statements within comparably short periods of time. In this paper, the technical implementation of the web applications using JavaScript and WebGL with their corresponding advantages are described. Additionally, their utilization is discussed with regard to didactic considerations. A questionnaire-based evaluation with respect to students' acceptance of the visualizations and its influence on examination performance was carried out and concluding results are presented. © 2013 IEEE.","blended learning; e-learning; electrical engineering; JavaScript; Situated learning; visualization of mathematics; web applications; WebGL","Applications; E-learning; Electrical engineering; High level languages; Information technology; Students; Three dimensional; Visualization; World Wide Web; Blended learning; Javascript; Situated learning; WEB application; WebGL; Three dimensional computer graphics","Biehler, R., Fischer, P.R., Hochmuth, R., Wassong, T., Remedial scenarios for online and blended learning bridging courses (2012) Proc. of the 7th Congress of the European Society for Research in Mathematics Education; Lawson, D., Croft, A., Carpenter, S., Mathematics support real, virtual and mobile (2008) The International Journal for Technology in Mathematics Education, 15 (2), pp. 73-78; Clark, R.C., Mayer, R.E., (2011) E-learning and the Science of Instruction: Proven Guidelines for Consumers and Designers of Multimedia Learning, , 3rd ed.

Hence from the very beginning eLearning was introduced also virtual lessons were a part of the curriculum. In the first years the handling of the virtual lessons was purely manual resulting in a huge amount of administrative efforts for the teachers and the staff. Since 2008 we consecutively introduced software and interfaces between the learning management system and our central administration system in order to automatize virtual lessons as much as possible and significantly reduce the administrative efforts from the teachers. With the introduction of version 2 of this interface called MOMOS we have now also a good usability for the administration staff. In this paper we describe how we applied our infrastructure managing virtual lessons in medical education to our modular based curriculum.

Moreover, today's students, often described as ""Gen-Z"", have grown up in a world of lifelong use of technology, such as mobile phones, MP3 players, the Internet and the World Wide Web, YouTube, Google etc. Motivating somebody who ""has literally seen it all in in terms of methodology is one of the most challenging tasks for an educator"" (Sluneckova, 2011). The sole use of technology itself cannot provide the desired result of motivating students and engaging them more actively in their own education, technology is no longer a motivating factor, and it is a must. This paper describes the implementation of e-learning strategies to move e-learning beyond learning management systems and engage students in the active use of e-technologies for their self-directed, problem-based and collaborative learning. The main focus is on specific e-learning activities to meet the needs of intermediate to upper-intermediate students of English as a Foreign Language at the University of Defence.

While increasing and innovative use of interactive digital technologies has been a hallmark of recent changes to higher education practice, the integration of traditional and innovative digital techniques in learning and teaching design and practice remains a crucial issue for university educators. There has been a tendency for new technologies to be added to existing curriculum design and learning and teaching practice in an ad hoc, isolated manner, rather than as part of an overarching learning design which incorporates both new technologies and traditional techniques and understanding of pedagogic principles and practice.

More and more higher education institutions are integrating e-learning into their standard pedagogy. Course Management System (CMS) is a kind of e-learning system which is adopted to facilitate instructors and students to deliver course materials, submit assignments and tests, create learning activities, and share documents. Our Institute has started to use Moodle as our CMS for two years. In this paper, we will present preliminary findings from a small scale study exploring the students' experiences on using our Moodle system. The data are obtained from group interviews with students. The preliminary findings indicate that students only utilize Moodle system for performing limited learning tasks. Students prefer using social networking to using our Moodle system for discussing assignments and sharing learning materials with classmates. As CMS is under-utilized, we believe that if students are more inclined to use CMS cooperated with popular social networking services, it may effectively promote online community and enhance collaborative learning amongst students. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.","CMS; collaboration learning; community building; Course Management System; e-learning; Moodle","E-learning; Online systems; Social networking (online); Teaching; CMS; collaboration learning; Community buildings; Course management systems; Moodle; Students","Bergen, P.F., (2013) The State of the Learning Management System, , https://itservices.uchicago.edu/connect/article/statelearning-management-system-university-chicago-and-beyond, at The University of Chicago and Beyond, The University of Chicago, (retrieved April 17, 2013); (2012) Campus Computing Project, , http://www.campuscomputing.net/sites/urlwww.campuscomputing.net/files, (retrieved April 27, 2013); (2013) Moodle site, , https://moodle.cuhk.edu.hk/, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, CUHK; (2013) Moodle site, , http://moodle.cihe.edu.hk/, The Caritas Institute of Higher Education, CIHE; (2003) Course Management Systems, , http://www.educause.edu/ir/library/pdf/DEC0302.pdf, EDUCAUSE Evolving Technologies Committee, CMS, (retrieved April 25, 2013); (2013) Moodle site, , http://webtl.hkbu.edu.hk/, The Hong Kong Baptist University, HKBU; (2013) Moodle site, , https://moodle.ied.edu.hk, The Hong Kong Institute of Education, HKIEd; (2013) Moodle site, , http://moodle.hku.hk, The Hong Kong University, HKU; (2013) Moodle site, , http://www.ln.edu.hk/moodle, LingnanUniversity, LU; Muñoz, C.L., Towner, T.L., Opening Facebook: How to Use Facebook in the College Classroom (2009) Society For Information Technology & Teacher Education International Conference, , In: Gibson, I., Weber, R., McFerrin, K., Carlsen, R., Willis, D.A.

The study will move away from the traditional definitions of diversity and explore the different characteristics of diverse learners in a modern-day setting using up-to-date technology. It will attempt to highlight factors that affect the experiences of online students and to offer practical guidelines for educators who are concerned with technology enhanced learning spaces in Higher Education (HE), and extends to adult education, training providers and further education. The findings could also impact on and benefit diverse learners by proposing strategies that facilitate individualised, needs tailored learning, particularly on blended learning programmes. A mixed methods study will evolve through two distinct phases: Phase 1 will draw on narratives using semi-structured interviews and a full review of the literature, publications and journal articles. This will serve not only to explore the many characteristics of diverse students but also investigate current and emerging pedagogies in the field of educational research; Phase 2 will build on the findings from Phase 1. The findings will be restructured to generate a conceptual framework. A full evaluation will take place to test the reliability and validity of the framework with other diverse student groups and teachers by administering an online questionnaire survey. The focus of this paper is to outline the background, current literature, objectives and methodology of the research and to discuss the next steps. At the time of writing, a Pilot Study has been completed and the primary research is at the early stages of data collection. The Pilot Study resulted in a need to re-word and re-order the interview questions to gain richer data from the sample which is now being implemented in the interview process. It is anticipated that Phase 1 analysis will be completed by October 2013.","Digital inclusion; Diverse students; Technology enhanced learning (TEL)","E-learning; Research; Teaching; Conceptual frameworks; Digital inclusion; Educational research; Online questionnaire; Practical guidelines; Reliability and validity; Semi structured interviews; Technology enhanced learning; Students","Alexander, B., Web 2.0 A New Wave of Innovation for Teaching and Learning?

In the field of pre-service teacher education, a rising challenge is to equip the ""21st century teacher"" with the necessary toolset of skills, competencies and mindsets to grapple with the idiosyncrasies of the new generation of ""millenials"". To this purpose, what still remains an open issue is the degree of innovation afforded by specific eLearning designs, in a field where traditional teacher training pedagogies co-exist with eLearning-specific ones. This article proposes a synthesis of two eLearning-specific models, the Community of Inquiry (COI) Model, based on the Practical Inquiry Model introduced by Garrison, Anderson, &amp; Archer (2000) and the Learning by Design framework (LbyD), based on the conceptualization of 'New Learning', as articulated by Kalantzis &amp; Cope (2012). Both models were invented with new and learning styles and circumstances in mind. The six-month introductory course on ""Pedagogical designs with ICT"" was offered by the School of Pedagogical and Technological Education (ASPETE) and implemented with 20 trainee teachers at the Higher Education Technological Institute (TEI) of Lamia, located in another geographical area of Greece. In this context, elements of the COI framework were employed as tools both for designing and for evaluating the contents, structure and activities of the eLearning course. Two elements of the framework, teaching and cognitive presence were the axes supporting the course structure, whilst the kinds of activities we aimed at promoting the most were discussion, collaboration and reflection. The LbyD framework served as an awareness enhancement mechanism for trainee teachers to formulate, collaboratively negotiate and finally express pedagogical scenarios integrating the meaningful use of technology. The discussion of this experience is supported by a preliminary analysis on the basis of COI-based questionnaires distributed to students, written free-text student feedback, asynchronous discussion transcripts and final students' products in the form of learning scenarios integrating the use of technology.","Blended learning; Community of inquiry; Course design; Learning design; Teacher training","Curricula; E-learning; Structural design; Students; Surveys; Teaching; Technology; Tools; Blended learning; Community of inquiry; Course design; Learning designs; Teacher training; Personnel training","Abbit, J., Ophus, J., What we know about the Impacts of Web-Quests: A review of research (2008) AACE Journal, 16 (4), pp. 441-456; Anderson, T., Rourke, L., Garrison, D.R., Archer, W., Assessing teaching presence in a computer conference context (2001) Journal of Asynchronous Learning Networks, 5. , http://www.sloanc.org/publications/jaln/v5n2/pdf/v5n2_anderson.pdf, available at, last access: 13/5/2013; Barnett, M., Issues and trends concerning electronic networking technologies for teacher professional development: A critical review of the literature (2002), paper presented at the annual meeting of American Educational Research Association, New Orleans; Bates, A., Computer-assisted learning or communications: which way for information technology in distance education?

E-learning has provided data related to students' activities, such as frequency of access and time/duration of each activity, which are not obtained through conventional educational processes. In many classes, the students' level of understanding has been measured only through term-end examinations. It has, therefore, been difficult to give students with low levels of understanding appropriate educational support from the early phase of courses. However, e-learning possibly provides data that enable us to identify students who require support early on in a course. In this study, we hypothesized that students who show infrequent access to e-learning and low achievement on e-learning tasks tend to obtain low grades on term-end examinations. We evaluated the relationship between frequency/achievement on compulsory and voluntary e-learning tasks and term-end examination grades to test the hypothesis and to give potential poor performers effective support early on. In 2011 and 2012, the Dermatology and Cardiology courses utilized e-learning for uploading of class materials, quizzes and class evaluations. In Dermatology, quiz assignments were compulsory tasks, while viewing of materials and class evaluations were voluntary tasks. In Cardiology, quizzes and class evaluations were compulsory tasks, while viewing of materials was a voluntary task. We examined the correlation between term-end examination grades and achievement on compulsory tasks, including quizzes in Dermatology and Cardiology, and class evaluations in Cardiology. Also, we examined the correlation between term-end examination grades and achievement on voluntary tasks, including view rates of class materials in Dermatology and Cardiology, and class evaluations in Dermatology. Compulsory quizzes in Dermatology/Cardiology and compulsory class evaluations in Cardiology showed no correlation with term-end examination grades. In contrast, voluntary access to uploaded class materials in Dermatology/Cardiology showed a positive correlation with term-end examination grades, suggesting that students with lower access to voluntary tasks tend to obtain lower grades on term-end examinations. With regard to class evaluations in Dermatology, the submission rate showed a correlation with term-end examination grades. In addition, students' degree of understanding, one of the questions on the class evaluation questionnaire, demonstrated a positive correlation with the examination grades. These findings suggest that data from voluntary class evaluations may also provide information that identifies potential poor performers. E-learning provides numerous data that may improve educational efficacy. In this study, data from compulsory tasks showed no difference between task achievement and termend examination grades. Data from voluntary tasks, however, showed a positive correlation with term-end examination grades. Therefore, data from voluntary e-learning tasks may be useful to identify potential poor performers in the early phases of courses, thus enabling teachers to more efficiently and effectively provide educational support.","Blended learning; e-learning; Medical education; Moodle; Poor performers","Cardiology; Dermatology; E-learning; Medical education; Teaching; Blended learning; Communication tools; E-learning systems; Educational process; Moodle; Open-source learning; Poor performers; Positive correlations; Students","Arianne, M., A blended approach to active learning in a physiology laboratory-based subject facilitated by an elearning component (2008) Adv Phsiol Educ, 32, pp. 65-75; Delialioglu, O., Investigation of source of motivation in a hybrid course (2004), http://www.eric.ed.gov/PDFS/ED485032.pdf, (on-line); Kitsantas, A., Chow, A., College students' perceived threat and preference for seeking help in traditional, distributed, and distance learning environments (2007) Comp Educ, 48, pp. 383-395; Ozuah, P.O., Undergraduate medical education: Thoughts on future challenges (2002), BMC Medical Education; Rowe, M., Physiotherapy students' use of online technology as part of their learning practices: a case study (2012) S Afr J Physiother, 68 (1), pp. 29-34; Ruiz, J.G., The impact of e-learning in medical education (2006) Acad Med, 81 (3), pp. 207-212; Rusnakova, V., Integration of the e-learning into the medical university curricula (2012) Bratisl Med J, 113 (5), pp. 324-330; Shih, C.C., Gamon, J., Web-based learning: relationship among student motivation attitudes, learning styles, and achievement (2001) J Agricultural Educ, 42, pp. 12-20",20488637,9781629933191,,"English",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84899507769

The primary goal of Project Management subject is to expose students to professional project management practices. The objectives typically include not only teaching theory, terms, definitions and new concepts related to the subject but also the transfer of new technical skills in using and applying specialized software as well as managerial skills dealing with people (interpersonal communications theory, dialogue, critical thinking and analysis skills, leadership theory, organizational theory, and team building). The CHAOS Report in 1995 providing the results of a survey which gathered data on reasons for Information Technology project failures. While a number of researchers have expressed questions on the methodology (Glass, 2006) used in creating the report, there have been indications from other researchers that the use of professional project managementpractices improves the chances of project success. Therefore the essence of delivering Project Management becomes crucial nowadays to ensure all students meet the required learning outcomes. In additionto classroom-based activities that regularly delivered every semester, INTI International University has introduced more innovative way of learning that combine classroom-based activity with onlinebaseddelivery known as Blended Learning (BL) methodology. Blended learning refers to course or subject that combine face to face classroom with online learning and reduced classroom contact hours. By having two methodologies at one time provides opportunity for students to have more flexible learning time exploring their understanding beyond the classrooms. Applying BL methodology for Project Management subject is challenging in a way that methods of delivery has to ensure the conceptual integration between classroom-based mode and online-based mode without less estimation to the importance of team work for both. This research therefore aims to develop a quality framework in making Project Management effective by identifying components of framework, investigating issues and factors that should be considered in learning with BL mode. The suggested components are based on the literature that identifies suggested best practices and experience presenting various subjects online. Further, a qualitative measurement was introduced to measure and compare student's perception on learning Project Management with BL and Traditional Learning as a progressive quality control towards the proposed framework.","Blended learning; eLearning; Project management; Quality framework; Quality online delivery","Analysis skills; Blended learning; Critical thinking; E-learning materials; Face to face; Higher education; Information technology projects; Inter-personal communications; Leadership theory; Learning outcome; Learning time; Malaysia; Managerial skills; Online delivery; Online learning; Organizational theory; Project management practices; Project success; Qualitative measurements; Specialized software; Team building; Team work; Technical skills; Traditional learning; Communication; E-learning; Government data processing; Information technology; Research; Students; Teaching; Project management","Anuwar, A., Issues & challenges in implementing eLearning in Malaysia (2011) The International Medical University Seminar, , Malaysia; Anderson, J., Mccormic, R., Ten Pedagogic Principles for ELearning (2005) Oinsight Observatory for New Technologies and Education, , http://www.itslearning.net, available at, Accessed January 19,2012; Campbell, C., (2004) Remote piano lessons, in real time, , New York Times, March 11, 2004; Cresswell, J.W., Research Design Qualitative (2009) Quantitative, and Mixed Methods Approaches, SAGE Inc., , USA; Digital Software Magazine (2011) Soft Magazine and King Content Co, , http://softwaremag.com, Available at, Accessed November 25, 2011; Dziuban, C., Hartman, J.L., Moskal, P.D., (2004) Research Buletin Volume 2004, (7), pp. 1-5. , University of Central Florida; Geist, D.B., Myers, M.E., Pedagogy and Project Management: Should You Practice What You Preach?

However, there is not such a model fully explains the interrelationships of the students, the teachers, and the external dimensions of factors affecting students and teachers in LMS adoption and use. This study aims to explore the students' and teachers' use of LMS by reviewing previous literature. Six dimensions of factors (students, teachers, technology, resources, pedagogy, and curriculum) affecting information and communication technology (ICT) use in education were identified and discussed. Finally, a holistic ICT adoption model (HICTAM) comprising all these dimensions is proposed. The implication and contribution of this model is included in the discussion section.

We analyze this example of how diversity can be an asset and how learning management systems can act as mediators to overcome the challenges of diversity and the barriers of emotional isolation. We were carrying out a participatory action research project, within a blended learning environment supported by Moodle, to develop collaborative and personal pedagogical strategies to improve the inclusion and engagement of higher education students in their own learning and evaluation. We were using content analysis of the online discussions held by the students, of the reflective descriptions of the classes, of the students' e-portfolios, and of the interviews with the students.

Increasingly, emphasis is being placed on the design of new learning spaces, often referred to as ""Next Generation Learning Spaces"" (NGLS) and their impact on pedagogy. The traditional idea of ""classroom"" now incorporates the use of both physical and virtual space. Increasing availability of digital technologies has enabled access by teachers and students to a wider range of communication and information that can now be incorporated into the formal learning process. This change has meant a greater focus on the design and use of flexible learning spaces, more use of blended learning approaches and more personalised, individualised learning opportunities for students. While many such classrooms have been built and used in universities globally, only a few formal studies have been reported on how these spaces are used by both teachers and students. This article focuses on a pilot study of the use by academic staff and students of a next generation learning space - the Pod Room - and makes recommendations for further research into the effectiveness of new learning spaces in universities. © 2012 G.

The authors explore the influence of teachers' perceptions of their competence in the use they make of digital material and to measure institutional support for teachers in this area. The methodology consists of an ad hoc questionnaire designed for a representative sample from four universities and the application of Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA) and Structural Equation Modelling (SEM). The results show that the use of Learning Management Systems (LMS) in universities in Andalusia is common but there is little sign of educational innovation, except in a minority of teachers. In addition, it was found that teachers' perceptions of their technological competence influenced their use of LMS but not the pedagogical model. The university pedagogical model must be reconceptualised, with a shift in traditional university values toward innovation, cooperation, and a shared construction of knowledge.

This paper presents a case study that proposes a computer-assisted collaborative experience designed to help students in their transition from high school to university. This is done by facilitating their first contact with the campus and its services, the university community, methodologies and activities. The experience combines individual and collaborative activities, conducted in and out of the classroom, structured following the Jigsaw Collaborative Learning Flow Pattern. A specific environment including portable technologies with network and computer applications has been developed to support and facilitate the orchestration of a flow of learning activities into a single integrated learning setting. The result is a Computer Supported Collaborative Blended Learning scenario that has been evaluated with first-year university students of the degrees of Software and Audiovisual Engineering within the subject Introduction to Information and Communications Technologies. The findings reveal that the scenario improves significantly students' interest in their studies and their understanding about the campus and services provided. The environment is also an innovative approach to successfully support the heterogeneous activities conducted by both teachers and students during the scenario. This paper introduces the goals and context of the case study, describes how the technology was employed to conduct the learning scenario, the evaluation methods and the main results of the experience. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The primary goal of Project Management subject is to expose students to professional project management practices. The objectives typically include not only teaching theory, terms, definitions and new concepts related to the subject but also the transfer of new technical skills in using and applying specialized software as well as managerial skills dealing with people (interpersonal communications theory, dialogue, critical thinking and analysis skills, leadership theory, organizational theory, and team building). The CHAOS Report in 1995 providing the results of a survey which gathered data on reasons for Information Technology project failures. While a number of researchers have expressed questions on the methodology (Glass, 2006) used in creating the report, there have been indications from other researchers that the use of professional project management practices improves the chances of project success. Therefore the essence of delivering Project Management becomes crucial nowadays to ensure all students meet the required learning outcomes. In addition to classroom-based activities that regularly delivered every semester, INTI International University has introduced more innovative way of learning that combine classroom-based activity with onlinebased delivery known as Blended Learning (BL) methodology. Blended learning refers to course or subject that combine face to face classroom with online learning and reduced classroom contact hours. By having two methodologies at one time provides opportunity for students to have more flexible learning time exploring their understanding beyond the classrooms. Applying BL methodology for Project Management subject is challenging in a way that methods of delivery has to ensure the conceptual integration between classroom-based mode and online-based mode without less estimation to the importance of team work for both. This research therefore aims to develop a quality framework in making Project Management effective by identifying components of framework, investigating issues and factors that should be considered in learning with BL mode. The suggested components are based on the literature that identifies suggested best practices and experience presenting various subjects online. Further, a qualitative measurement was introduced to measure and compare student's perception on learning Project Management with BL and Traditional Learning as a progressive quality control towards the proposed framework.","Blended learning; ELearning; Project management; Quality framework; Quality online delivery","E-learning; Human resource management; Students; Teaching; Blended learning; Information technology projects; Inter-personal communications; Online delivery; Organizational theory; Project management practices; Qualitative measurements; Specialized software; Project management","Ali, A., (2011) Issues &Challenges in Implementing ELearning in Malaysia, , The International Medical University Seminar, Malaysia; Anderson, J., McCormic, R., (2005) Ten Pedagogic Principles for ELearning, Oinsight Observatory for New Technologies and Education, , http://www.itslearning.net, Accessed January 19,2012; Campbell, C., (2004) Remote Piano Lessons, in Real Time, , New York Times, March 11, 2004; Cresswell, J.W., (2009) Research Design Qualitative, Quantitative, and Mixed Methods Approaches, , SAGE Inc.

Thus, it is important for high school science teachers to be teaching current scientific methods. To update their skills high school teachers need to participate in professional development programs to update their own knowledge of current science research and techniques used in labs. Towards this goal, the John A. Burns School of Medicine at the University of Hawaii developed a professional development program for high school science teachers. In 2012, eight high school science teachers attended the program for eight week days over a two week period. This study is a report of the teachers’ experiences within the program. Specifically, this paper reports on the results of the teachers’ evaluation of the online materials and their perspectives of real world application of the learned material are investigated. The data set in this study includes all eight teachers’ pre-survey responses and final survey data. © 2012 Lisa van Raalte, Rachel Boulay, & Chris Campbell.","Blended learning; Educational technology; Online learning; Professional development","E-learning; Educational technology; Medicine; Professional aspects; Social networking (online); Students; Surveys; Blended learning; High school teachers; On-line materials; Online learning; Professional development; Professional development program; Scientific method; University of Hawaii; Teaching","Andrewartha, G., Wilmot, S., Can multimedia meet tertiary educational needs better than the conventional lecture?

Most people use new technologies every day, because it is a more comfortable and quicker way of achieving their objectives. eLearning is one of the modern approaches in educational field. The e-courses of different types are part of eLearning, for example, blended and distant courses of eLearning. E-courses now are more complicated than in previous 10 years, because they include many different tools of Web 2.0. The preparation of eLearning courses at universities requires the university teacher to have the abilities to transform the science system into a didactical system using didactical analysis of the study content. The eLearning increases requirements for the lecturer (educator) mainly in the area of structuring learning material and defining the minimal accepted performance. It is important that the lecturer could define requirements for an effective evaluation corresponding to the learning goals and create space not only for the evaluation of memorized knowledge but also the evaluation at the level of logical, critical and creative thinking and the evaluation of the ability to use information resources. Taking into account that the Latvia University of Agriculture (LUA) has little experience in designing ecourses, the academic staff implemented only blended eLearning courses. This paper introduces the e-course quality assessment at the LUA. Quality criteria for assessment of e-courses designed by experts in the fields of eLearning and didactics (the authors) were used. The experts analyzed 30 e-courses designed by the academic staff in different fields of agriculture science. The paper presents the analysis of common problems in designing e-courses. The main problems were connected with communication blocs in e-courses (such as chats, forums, individual tasks etc.), designed quizzes and the definition of the evaluation system. Many of the designed ecourses had didactic problems.","Assessment criteria; Blended learning; E-course in higher education; Moodle environment","Agriculture; Curricula; Agriculture science; Assessment criteria; Blended learning; Didactical analysis; Higher education; Information resource; Moodle environment; University teachers; Teaching","http://www.businessperform.com/workplace-training/addie_model.html, ADDIE Model-Training Project Phases; Baylor, A., Ritchie, D., What factors facilitate teacher skill, teacher morale, and perceived student learning in technology-using classrooms (2002) Jurnal of the Computers and Education, 39 (4); Conrad, K., (2000) Instructionaal Design for We-based Training, p. 11. , Amherst:HRD Press TrainingLinks; Daukilas, S., Kainien, I., Vaišnorien, D., Vašilavidin, V., Factors that impact quality of eteaching/ learning (2008) Jurnal of Technologies in Higher Education, 2008, pp. 132-151; Edmandson, A., (2003) What Styles of Computer Training Enhance Teachers' Competence and Confidence to Use ICT, , http:www.becta.org.uk/research/docs/cpd_edmondson.pgf/, 2003, Internet address:; Engelbrecht, E., A look at eLearning models: Investigating their value for developing an eLearning strategy (2003) Progressio, 25 (2), pp. 38-47. , www.http://uir.unisa.ac.za/bitstream/handle/10500/4992/engelbrecht.pdf? sequence=1; Galanouli, D., Murphy, C., Gardner, J., Teacher's perceptions of the effectiveness of ict-competence training (2004) Jurnal of the Computers and Education, 43 (4); Garrison, D.R., Kanuka, H., Blended learning: Uncovering its transformative potential in higher education (2004) Journal of the Internet and Higher Education 7, 2, pp. 95-105. , 2004; Gray, D.E., Ryan, M., Coulon, A., (2004) The Training of Teachers and Trainers: Innovative Practices, Skills and Competencies in the Use of ELearning, , http://www.eurodl.org/materials/contrib/2004/Gray_Ryan_Coulon/Appendix2. htm; Helic, D., Managing collaborative learning processes in elearning applications (2007) Proceedings of the ITI 2007 29th International Conference on Information Technology Interfaces, Cavtat/Dubrovnik, Croatia, 2007, pp. 345-350; Kellner, D., New technologies/new literacies: Reconstructing education for the new millenium (2001) International Journal of Technologies and Design, 11, pp. 67-81. , 2001; (2005) European Quality Observatory, , http://www2.trainingvillage.gr/etv/publication/download/panorama/5162_en. pdf, Quality in eLearning, Report2008:11R.

But what if the course was not traditionally taught but instead used a blended learning approach? Are standard evaluations of teaching a valid method for such classes? Communication Research is such a blended learning undergraduate course, which teaches the fundamentals of empirical research via survey design, analysis and reporting. The unit is challenging for first year Communication students who have no previous experience with research reports or statistics. Standardised evaluation surveys show consistent below-average feedback scores when compared with the school and university. However, a custom online pretest/posttest evaluation of the outcomes show significant learning has occurred in every one of the learning objectives. Thus, what exactly do standardized course evaluations measure? Such standardised processes are utilised in almost all higher education institutions. Results are taken on face value and often used for academic tenure, promotion and salary rises. Previous research has detected a range of issues arising from standardised surveys. Are our courses amenable to such assessment, or do we need to better ways to evaluate traditional and blended learning classes? © 2011 IADIS.","Assessment; Blended learning; E-learning; Evaluation; Survey","Assessment; Blended learning; Communication research; Complex task; Course evaluations; Empirical research; Evaluation; First year; Higher education institutions; Learning objectives; Research reports; Standard evaluations; Survey design; Undergraduate Courses; Communication; Computer science; Curricula; E-learning; Information systems; Research; Surveys; Wages; Teaching","Baruch, Y., Holton, B.C., Survey response rate levels and trends in organizational research (2008) Human Relations, 61 (8), pp. 1139-1160. , doi: 10.1177/0018726708094863; Brown, M.J., Baillie, M., Fraser, S., Rating ratemyprofessors.com: A comparison of online and official student evaluations of teaching (2009) College Teaching, 57 (2), pp. 89-92. , Retrieved from EBSCOhost; Cohen, P.A., Student ratings of instruction and student achievement: A metaanalysis of multisection validity studies (1981) Review of Educational Research, 51, pp. 281-309; Cronbach, L.J., Course improvement through evaluation (1963) Teachers College Record, 64 (8), pp. 672-683; Darby, J., Evaluating course evaluations: The need to establish what is being measured (2007) Assessment & Evaluation in Higher Education, 32 (4), pp. 441-455. , Retrieved from ERIC database; Dommeyer, C.J., Baum, P., Hanna, R.W., Gathering faculty teaching evaluations by in-class and online surveys: Their effects on response rates and evaluations (2004) Assessment & Evaluation in Higher Education, 29 (5), pp. 611-623. , Retrieved from EBSCOhost; Eiszler, C.F., College students' evaluations of teaching and grade inflation (2002) Research in Higher Education, 43 (4), pp. 483-501; Emery, C.R., Kramer, T.R., Tian, R.G., Return to academic standards: A critique of student evaluations of teaching effectiveness (2003) Quality Assurance in Education, 11 (1), pp. 37-46. , 2003; Frick, T., Chadha, R., Watson, C., Zlatkovska, E., Improving course evaluations to improve instruction and complex learning in higher education (2010) Educational Technology Research and Development, 58 (2), pp. 115-136. , Retrieved from ERIC database; Greenwood, G.E., Ramagli, H.J., Alternatives to student ratings of college teaching (1980) Journal of Higher Education, 51 (6), pp. 75-81; Kulik, J.A., Theall, M., Abrami, P.C., Mets, L.A., Student ratings: Validity, utility, and controversy (2001) The Student Ratings Debate: Are They Valid?

The aim of this research project was to increase the performance of these students. A literature review on learning and learning styles was done, followed by an interpretive study on the students' learning styles and their readiness for e-learning. E-learning material, specifically catering for different learning styles, was developed. Analysis of the intervention was done in three phases. Firstly, web-logs of the learning management system were analysed to gain insights into the usage of e-learning material by students involved. Secondly, correlation of time spent on the e-learning material and the marks obtained by these students in formative and summative evaluations were tested statistically, and thirdly, an interpretive questionnaire was used to understand the attitude of the students towards the e-learning material. The conclusion of the paper focuses on the success of the blended learning environment, as the performance of the students improved. From a research methodology perspective, the project could be seen as an action research project using mixed methods. © 2011 IADIS.","Action research; Blended learning; E-learning; Learning styles; Web usage analysis","Action research; Blended learning; Computer networking; E-learning materials; Gain insight; Interpretive study; Learning management system; Learning Style; Literature reviews; Mixed method; Networking systems; Research methodologies; South Africa; Three phasis; Time spent; University of Technology; Web usage analysis; Computer networks; E-learning; Information systems; Research; Students","Baskerville, R.L., Investigating information systems with action research (1999) Communications of the Association for Information Systems, 2 (19), pp. 2-31. , Oct; Bryman, A., Paradigm peace and the implications for quality (2006) International Journal of Social Research Methodology, 9 (2), pp. 111-126; Carliner, S., (2004) An Overview of Online Learning, , Amherst, Mass.: HRD Press; Felder, R.M., (2009) Index of Learning Styles, , http://www4.ncsu.edu/unity/lockers/users/f/felder/public/ILSpage.html, Date of access: 15 Sep. 2009; Felder, R.M., Silverman, L.K., Learning and teaching styles in engineering education (1988) Journal of Engineering Education, 78 (7), pp. 674-681; Kerres, M., De Witt, C., A didactical framework for the design of blended learning arrangements (2003) Journal of Educational Media, 28 (2-3), pp. 101-113; Littlejohn, A., Pegler, C., Preparing for blended e-learning (2007) Connection with E-learning, , Florence, KY: Routledge; Mingers, J., Combining IS research methods: Towards a pluralist methodology (2001) Information Systems Research, 12 (3), pp. 240-259; Symonds, J.E., Gorard, S., Death of mixed methods? or the rebirth of research as a craft (2010) Evaluation & Research in Education, 23 (2), pp. 121-136; Tashakkori, A., Creswell, J., The new era of mixed methods (2007) Journal of Mixed Methods Research, 1 (1), pp. 3-8; Teddlie, C.B., Tashakkori, A., (2009) Foundations of Mixed Methods Research: Integrating Quantitative and Qualitative Approaches in the Social and Behavioral Sciences, p. 347. , Thousand Oaks, Ca.

These interactive animations help students in the concepts acquisition, thanks to their visual and interactive features. The designed animations include all kind of logic gates (e.g., OR, AND, NOR; NAND, EXOR), Boole's algebra, many combinational and sequential circuits (e.g., coders, decoders, multiplexors, demultiplexors, comparators, synchronous and asynchronous flip-flops, chronograms, synchronous and asynchronous counters, and shift registries). These interactive animations have been embedded in many examples, exercises and auto-evaluation exams, which facilitate the understanding of the different concepts. Besides, these interactive animations have been encapsulated as learning objects and included in a learning object repository. Thus, anyone in the Web can search, find and use these digital resources. Finally, these interactive animations have been used in two different environments: high school and distance learning university. A different methodology has been used in each one of these environments to fit its requirements. © 2011 IEEE.","Blended learning; digital electronics; interactive simulation; learning objects","Blended learning; Digital electronics; Digital resources; High school; Interactive animations; Interactive features; Interactive learning; Interactive simulations; Learning object repositories; Learning objects; Teaching and learning; Work in progress; Asynchronous sequential logic; Curricula; World Wide Web; E-learning","McGreal, R., Roberts, T., A Primer on Metadata for Learning Objects: Fostering an interoperable environment (2001) E-Learning, 2 (I10), pp. 26-29; (2007) LOM XML Schema Definition, , http://ltsc.ieee.org/xsd/lomv1.0/, On-line.

A survey was conducted with 19 bLearning course directors in 11 Portuguese HEIs and two sets of data were collected and analyzed: how the evaluation of bLearning courses has been made and how they think it should be made in order to enhance their quality. Questions like who evaluates, how to evaluate, what is evaluated and what to evaluate for and also what should be implemented in order to improve course quality were put to the course directors under scrutiny. Results revealed that students, teachers and directors are the main performers of modules evaluation, although institutional and external agents themselves are seen as very relevant. The main instruments used for evaluation are the course final reports and the students' final questionnaires. The discussion forums should also be included as important instruments to evaluate online modules. As to the objects of evaluation that are being selected in Portuguese institutions all directors mentioned the communication tools used, the quality of didactic materials and the pertinence of the learning tasks proposed, all of them also seen as most pertinent for the purposes of evaluation. The main goals of evaluation are the improvement of the curricular plans and the adequacy of the teaching strategies. The study highlights the need for HEIs to reassess their approach to the QA of bLearning courses, and brings some contributions to those who are in charged of bLearning courses, providing a useful framework that covers all aspects of quality assurance in order to enhance teaching and learning quality. © 2011 IADIS.",,"Blended learning; Communication tools; Didactic materials; Discussion forum; Empirical studies; External agents; Higher education institutions; Learning tasks; Online modules; Teaching and learning; Teaching strategy; Computer science; E-learning; Education; Information systems; Quality assurance; Surveys; Quality control","Bliuc, A.C., Goodyear, P., Ellis, R.A., Research focus and methodological choices in studies into students' experiences of blended learning in higher education (2007) Internet and Higher Education, 10, pp. 231-244; Conole, G., Designing for learning (2007) Contemporary Perspectives in E-learning Research - Themes, Methods and Impact on Practice, pp. 101-120. , G.

Technological advances have, without a doubt, triggered this change and although research into methodologies and learning in this new environment still has a long way to go, c-learning platforms have reached a sufficient degree of maturity and standardization regarding their functions and tools. This article is dedicated to analysing e-learning platforms as a technological element necessary in any Virtual Training Environment (VTE) system. In it the following are studied: different platform types and their main tools, minimum requirements an institution needs to take into account when selecting a particular platform, as well as its advantages and drawbacks.

A frequently observed problem is that the learners become overtaxed during independent learning in virtual learning phases because they are not provided with the necessary support. For this reason, there is a great need for qualified instructors, so-called e-tutors, who are trained in the specific factors and requirements associated with virtual learning environments. Since 2005, Ludwig-Maximilian-University in Munich offers courses for the professional education of e-tutors through the Virtual University of Bavaria (VHB). The goal of this training is to meet the growing need for tutors to assist learners in the ever-increasing world of e-learning for advanced education courses at universities. In order to ensure that learning is practical and applicable, the training is designed as a blended learning course according to problem-oriented learning (Reinmann & Mandl, 2006) including a web-based training with self-directed and cooperative learning phases. The aim of this paper is to provide clarity about the quality and effectiveness of the training as well as evidence of the robustness and the success of the course concept over several iterations. The analysis focuses on aspects of the quality of the learning environment, acceptance and learning success. Overall, the course concept proved itself successful over various course iterations. © 2011 IADIS.","Blended-learning; E-tutoring; Evaluation; Problem-oriented learning; Training program","Blended-learning; E-tutoring; Evaluation; Problem-oriented learning; Training program; Computer science; Information systems; Learning systems; Quality control; Teaching; E-learning","Cosetti, A., Tutoring: A different role background for the same role (2002) Proceedings of Ed-Media 2002, pp. 355-356. , Denver, AACE; De Corte, E., Masui, C., (2009) Enhancing the Learning Proficiency of Students in Higher Education, , http://forumonpublicpolicy.com/summer08papers/archivesummer08/decorte.pdf, Forum on Public Policy Online; Dittler, U., Jechle, T., Tele-tutor-training: erfahrungen aus der qualifizierung von teletutoren (2004) Medienkompetenz für Die Hochschullehre, pp. 153-170. , K.

However, expensive equipment and limited time prevent teachers having sufficient educational platforms, and several low cost and flexible solutions have been developed to permit an effective teaching in Automatics and Robotics at a reasonable cost. Virtual and remote laboratories are inside this group of solutions as Web-based experimentation tools which have demonstrated the importance and effectiveness of hand-on experiences. This paper presents an experience teaching based on a blended-learning method using as experimentation tool a virtual and remote robotic laboratory called RobUALab, which is also described in the paper, in Automatics and Robotics subjects of the Computer Science degree at the University of Alicante. Students experiment with a set of hand-on exercises about Automatics and Robotics using RobUALab, firstly in face-to-face classes where they experiment in-situ with the real plant and, afterwards, they access to the experimentation environment in order to finish remotely their practical exercises outside the laboratory. The results obtained in the evaluation of the educational methodology proposed attest its efficiency in terms of learning degree and performance of the students. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Our aim is not just to see how the students can be empowered to act autonomously, but rather to understand how they can fare as full partners of the course management experience. To this end, we engage them in a cultural transformation based on strategies that promote their participation in their own learning and evaluation. This is done with the help of the evaluation star, an ideogram we have developed to support these strategies. Our study draws on principles proposed by Dewey, Freire, Knowles, Mezirow, and Fetterman, and follows a research approach based on two action research cycles that involve different courses, subjects, and students. Our study, which can be seen as a proof of concept, shows that the students have learned to evaluate and accept evaluation, share critical reflections, and take responsibility for their contributions. They have also participated democratically in their learning process and have built change, quality, and competent collective learning. © 2011 IEEE.","Blended-learning; empowerment evaluation; higher education; participatory evaluation","Action research; Blended-learning; Collective learning; Course management; Critical reflections; Cultural transformations; empowerment evaluation; Higher education; Learning process; participatory evaluation; Proof of concept; Research approach; Student populations; Students","Luckin, R., (2010) Redesigning Learning Contexts: Technology-rich, Learner-centred Ecologies, , New York: Routledge; Dewey, J., (1944) Democracy and Education: An Introduction to the Philosophy of Education, , New York: The Free Press; Knowles, M., (1975) Self-directed Learning, , New York: Association Press; Knowles, M., (1980) The Modern Practice of Adult Education, , Chicago: Association Press; Knowles, M., (1984) The Adult Learner: A Neglected Species, , Houston: Gulf Publishing; Freire, P., (1996) Letters to Cristina.

In order to achieve that goal, the students are organized in teams that must solve a problem and manage the development of a feasible solution to satisfy the needs of a client. The innovative component advocated in this paper is the formal introduction of negotiating and virtual team management aspects, as different teams from different universities at different locations and comprising students with different backgrounds must collaborate and compete amongst them. The different learning aspects are identified and the improvement levels are reflected in a rubric that has been designed ad hoc for this experience. Finally, the effort frameworks for the student and instructor have been established according to the requirements of the Bologna paradigms. This experience is developed through a software-based support system allowing blended learning for the theoretical and individual's work aspects, blogs, wikis, etc., as well as project management tools based on WWW that allow the monitoring of not only the expected deliverables and the achievement of the goals but also the progress made on learning as established in the defined rubric.","Bologna agreement; Collaborative learning; Distant learning; Project management; Project.net; Web 2.0","Bologna agreement; Collaborative learning; Distant learning; Project.net; Web 2.0; Distance education; Distributed computer systems; Project management; User interfaces; Students","Bouhadada, T., Laskri, M.T., An interactive webbased environment using pedagogical agents (2008) Journal of Computer Information Systems, 48 (4), pp. 39-48; Caupin, G., Knoepfel, H., Koch, G., Pannenbäcker, K., Perez-Polo, F., Seabury, C., (2006) IPMA Competence Baseline, Version 3, , International Project Management Association; Cavanaugh, C., Dawson, K., Design of online professional development in science content and pedagogy: A pilot study in Florida (2010) J.

To cope with their needs a general framework implemented through a standards-based open architecture focused on supporting inclusive learning at Higher Education has been developed in the EU4ALL project. The framework is implemented through an open service oriented architecture that can be integrated into current learning platforms. Services involving stakeholders (students and professionals) to attend users' needs are provided through standards-based framework components, which combine user-centred design tools with modelling techniques based on the state-of-the-art on semantic web technologies. The framework, the architecture and its components are being evaluated at large, medium and small universities to show their flexibility and appropriateness.

Mathematics forms the core for engineering and science studies at institutions of higher learning. However, analysis of student's performance in mathematics tasks reveals that mastery of skills is not acquired. This paper focuses on students understanding of elementary calculus in a blended learning course at a University of Technology (UOT). Conventional lectures were integrated with the computer laboratory teaching environment to promote interactive and discovery learning. Projects were designed to support the development of calculus frames in conjunction with a theoretical framework that was used in analyzing students understanding of integral calculus concepts. The students in the blended learning mathematics course (experimental group) was also compared to students that were traditionally lectured (control group). Both groups were assessed by the modified Orton's battery of tests on integral calculus. The experimental group exhibited deep learning of concepts, while the control group possessed more surface structures.","Blended learning; Calculus; Deep and surface structures",,"Naidoo, R., Technikon Students Understanding of Differentiation (1996) SAARMSE, , 96 Proceedings University of Stellenbosch; Tall, D., (2002) Using Technology to Support An Emboided Approach to Learning Concepts, , In Mathematics, First Coloquio De Historia E Tecnologia No Matema'tica at Universidade do estado do Rio De Janiero; Naidoo, K., Naidoo, R., First year students understanding of elementary concepts in differential calculus in a computer teaching environment (2007) Journal of College Teaching and Learning, 4 (8), pp. 99-114; Silverberg, J., Does calculus reform work?

Design/methodology/approach: Based on data obtained from 138 undergraduate business management students at a university in Singapore, practical aspects of effectively implementing an e-learning system with a focus on KM are analyzed and the importance determined of three conceptual variables in the context of successful blended learning approaches: online faculty to student interaction, social presence and personal e-learning experiences. Findings: The study shows some positive correlations between online faculty to student interaction, the degree of presence in a web-based learning environment, as well as personal e-learning experiences as potential drivers of students' desire to learn more about the subject matter KM. Research limitations/implications: There has been reliance on self-reported data in both the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats study and the student survey. The causal effects of students' perceptions on actual learning need to be explored in a future study with a larger sample size. Practical implications: To increase students' acceptance of a web-based KM course, instructors must ensure quality interaction between them and their students, strong social presence via intrinsically rewarding group interactions and enriching, personal e-learning experiences on the basis of real-life KM problems. Games, systematic performance monitoring and graded knowledge tests are critical, too.

In this context, novel educational concepts such as blended learning are being developed. In the present paper, we present the results obtained from a blended learning experience carried out at the University of Granada. A total of 17 groups took part, with 1431 students registered for the 2009-2010 academic year. In this study, we use objective outcomes and the students' perceptions regarding the blended learning activities performed. The study shows that the use of blended learning has a positive effect in reducing dropout rates and in improving exam marks. Moreover, the students' perceptions on blended learning are interrelated, with their final marks depending on the blended learning activities, and on the students' age, background and class attendance rate. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Most surveys measure responses to questions which are based on students' subjective impressions. The purpose of this study is to examine participants' assessments made during the transitional phase in an online learning environment which includes blended and fully online courses at a Japanese national university. Students were enrolled in two-unit Master's or Bachelor's degree courses which were taught by the same professor. The total number of students with valid survey data was 184 (92 Masters, 67 Bachelors for the blended learning course and 25 Bachelors for the fully online course). A survey questionnaire consisting of 10 questions measured the self-assessments of students' online learning experiences. Three factors were extracted. There are no significant differences in all factor scores between the beginnings and the ends of the courses. These results show the coherence of students' assessments during the course. The correlation coefficients of the first factor scores (e-learning evaluation) between the beginnings and the ends of the courses are not high, however (Masters: r=0.35, Bachelors for blended learning: r=0.46, and Bachelors for fully online: r=0.33). Therefore, some participants have changed their evaluations between the two surveys. When the differences in factor scores from the initial and final surveys are compared between students who rated the course highly at the beginning (high raters) and students who did not (low raters), the scores for the high raters decrease and the scores for the low raters increase. Also, the relationships between students' transitions and the metrics of their behaviour were investigated. © Academic Publishing International Ltd.","Assessment in transition; Blended learning; Fully online learning; Online learning; Student assessment",,"Anderson, J., Brown, G., Spaeth, S., Online Student Evaluations and Responses Rates Reconsidered (2006) Innovate, 2 (6). , http://www.innovateonline.info; Bates, A.W., (1999) Managing Technological Change, , Strategies for College and University Leaders, Jossey-Bass Publishers, San Francisco, USA; Coolican, H., (1994) Research Methods and Statistics In Psychology, , Hodder & Stoughton, London, UK; Craig, A., Goold, A., Coldwell, J., Mustard, J., Perceptions of Roles and Responsibilities inonline Learning: A Case Study (2008) Interdisciplinary Journal of E-Learning and Learning Object, 4, pp. 205-223; Deepwell, F., Embedding Quality in e-Learning Implementation through Evaluation (2007) Educational Technology & Society, 10 (2), pp. 34-43; Elton, L., University Teaching: A Professional Model for Quality (1993) Quality Assurance For University Teaching, pp. 133-146. , In R.

The participants in our study were students enrolled in a foreign policy course at a major Australian university. Students' conceptions of learning through discussion, and their approaches to both face-to-face and online discussion, were elicited through open-ended questionnaires and semi-structured interviews. Students' responses to both open-ended questionnaires and interviews were analysed using a phenomenographic framework. Qualitative variations in students' conceptions and approaches were categorised and were found to form a hierarchy. Subsequent quantitative analysis found associations between students' conceptions of learning through discussion, their approaches to both face-to-face and online discussion and their academic performance (as indicated by the final mark for the course).

It promotes flexible learning opportunities, interactive online activities and continuous learning processes. The paper focuses on an extra credit program that was developed to be an important element of the e-learning concept of the class. The program's effects will be discussed based on Blackboard statistics and student evaluation results from summer 2010. The main results are that the students valued the e-learning concept in general and the online recordings of the lectures in particular.

The authors follow the principled task-based curriculum design phases informed by Long and Crookes (1993) and Long and Norris (2000). Unit-based development made the workload manageable and provided an important experimental space for the instructors to best align task-based principles with online language instruction. First, the context of the project and its theoretical TBLT curriculum development framework are established. The distinct processes of needs analysis, materials development, task sequencing and teaching methods, and assessment methods adopted to meet the special requirements of the class are presented, along with a preliminary formative and summative evaluation of the teaching model. The conclusion discusses the theoretical and practical implications of the project.

This research was conducted by three members of the MBA team (the co-authors of this paper) - two senior lecturers and the ELearning Development Manager. The research focuses on the effectiveness of developments made in the course's delivery approach and learning content. The primary research method was semi-structured questionnaire survey, and data were collected from students taking the course during the past three years (2008-2010). Three rounds of survey were conducted, resulting in 149 valid responses in total. The first round showed a high level of student satisfaction with the programme as delivered, but also indicated areas that needed further improvement. The impacts of subsequent changes in the programme, and in the learning support system, were investigated in the second and third surveys. Feedback from these has helped develop more recent changes in the learning content and delivery approach of the programme. The paper presents the findings from these surveys, and describes changes in the programme. Overall, the findings helped improve the course's blended learning approach, enriched its content, and enhanced the quality of the programme. These findings may provide insights to course managers and eLearning developers of other such blended-learning courses offered in a global context.","ELearning; Evaluation; Questionnaire survey","E-learning; Human resource management; Managers; Students; Surveys; Teaching; Design and evaluations; E-learning design; Evaluation; Learning contents; Learning support systems; Questionnaire surveys; research methods; Student satisfaction; Curricula","Buzzetto-More, N., Student perceptions of various elearning components (2008) Interdisciplinary Journal of Knowledge and Learning Objects, 4, pp. 113-135; Deepwell, F., Embedding quality in elearning implementation through evaluation (2007) Journal of Educational Technology &Society, 10 (2), pp. 34-43; Goold, A., Craig, A., Coldwell, J., Accommodating culture and cultural diversity in online teaching (2007) Australasian Journal of Educational Technology, 23 (4), pp. 490-507; Gurǎu, C., Drillon, D., Evaluating the effectiveness of an international elearning system: The case of montpellier business school (2009) Proceedings of the International Conference on ELearning, 2009, pp. 174-181; Guri-Rosenblit, S., Distance education in the digital age: Common misconceptions and challenging tasks (2009) Journal of Distance Education, 23 (2), pp. 105-112; Jara, M., Mellar, H., Quality enhancement for elearning courses: The role of student feedback (2010) Computers and Education, 54 (3), pp. 709-714; Technology enhanced learning environments (2007) JISC ELearning Programme, , http://www.elearning.ac.uk/subjects/PLE, JISC, accessed on 22 may 2009; Kidney, G., Cummings, L., Boehm, A., Toward a quality assurance approach to elearning courses (2007) International Journal on ELearning, 6 (1), pp. 17-30; Lam, P., Bordia, S., Factors affecting student choice of elearning over traditional learning: Student and teacher perspectives (2008) International Journal of Learning, 14 (12), pp. 131-139; Lapointe, L., Reisetter, M., Belonging online: Students' perceptions of the value and efficacy of an online learning community (2008) International Journal on ELearning, 7 (4), pp. 641-665; Martínez-Argüelles, M., Castán, J., Juan, A., How do Students Measure Service Quality in elearning?

Since 1998 a learning management system (LMS) has been introduced as to broaden the physical boundaries of classrooms over four campuses, student residences and residential areas (worldwide). The Centre for Technology Assisted Learning (CenTAL) was established to accommodate students, teaching and research staffand empower them to keep up with current and future trends in technology-assisted learning. Currently a blended learning approach, with direct face-to-face (F2F) contact with students, is followed and driven by the ""learning to be"" philosophy of teaching and learning. F2F contact is supplemented with a remote e-learning environment hosted in an LMS. Consequently, the implementation of technology in teaching and learning became an adopted phenomenon and promised increased success in higher education. However, changing curricula, staffturnover and increasing student numbers resulted in the efficacy of the LMS used, to be questioned. Moreover, the actual learning experiences of students are often dismissed as a new paradigm and statistical evidence leads to a contradiction about blended learning efficacy during annual course evaluations. This occurrence often causes confusion when effective use of an LMS is discussed. Subsequently, this inception forces the perception of key role players in two directions: managing virtual learning environments and managing learning within an electronic learning environment. Ultimately, learning management as viewed by the constructivist, and classroom management as viewed by the behaviourist, are aligned by presenting various examples from an LMS for operational e-learning. Therefore, this paper points out the different perceptions of lecturers towards the effective use of an LMS as remote component for blended learning at UJ. Emerging from the above rationale, this paper points out traditional perceptions of lecturers towards e-learning and further poses the question: Is learning management or classroom management the platform for effective blended learning design? Findings and conclusions further addresses the consolidated data substantiated over a period of three years in nine faculties during research in professional development of faculty members related to effective, blended learning. The data and examples are presented as qualitative and, where more clarity is required, substantiated by quantitative data. The actual examples presented, point out teaching practices where classroom management was used as point of departure and then contrasted with examples where learning management was used as a starting point. This paper further reveals e-learning environments where this dichotomy becomes distinguishable but inseparable. An in-depth discussion extrapolates instructivist and constructivist approaches to be extremes of a continuum whereby ideal balance becomes a superlative teaching application for both F2F and online learning environments. In this case study this pedagogical paradigm escalates to an imperative for implementing effective technology-supported blended learning at the University of Johannesburg.","Classroom management; E-learning environment; Learning management; Learning management system (lms); Technology-assisted learning; Technology-supported blended learning","Computer aided instruction; Curricula; Education; Engineering education; Students; Teaching; Blended learning; Classroom management; E-learning environment; Learning management system; Learning managements; Technology-assisted learning; E-learning","Allen, J.D., Classroom management: students' perspectives, goals, and strategies (1986) American Educational Research Journal, 23, pp. 437-459; Anderson, T., (2004) Online Learning Theory.

We analyze this example of how diversity can be an asset and Moodle can act as a mediator. We were carrying out a participatory action research project within a blended learning environment supported by Moodle to develop collaborative and personal pedagogical strategies to improve the inclusion and engagement of higher education students in their own learning and evaluation. We have used content analysis of the online discussions held by the students, reflective descriptions of the classes, the students' e-portfolios, and interviews with the students.

The investigation of blended learning effectiveness, using online collaborative tools (as Google Applications: email, groups, calendar, forum, chat, shared documents), concludes that blended learning as an additional/complementary tool of teaching and learning is effective as much in students' performance as in their positive attitude to the use of new technologies in the educational process of the Informatics course. More specifically the students' attitudes before, during and after the use of technology as a supporting tool of educational process is investigated. Additionally the research paper examines the way that students' active attendance in the educational process - with the exploitation of eLearning and techniques of collaborative learning from distance- is encouraged,. The current research does not aim to compare the effectiveness of exploitation of eLearning with the one without it, but it approaches students' motivation and it gives an example of good practical exploitation of ICT. An educational framework of blended learning implementation which uses collaborative online tools (less important point the tool itself) to support a ""web-based"" class complementary to face-to-face class facilitates an effective students' collaboration and improves the efficiency of learning regarding both students' grades and their positive attitudes in using Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) in the educational process.","Blended learning; Collaborative learning; Secondary education; Teaching informatics","E-learning; Education; Engineering education; Information science; Social networking (online); Teaching; Blended learning; Collaborative learning; Collaborative tools; Educational process; Informatics; Information and Communication Technologies; Teaching and learning; Thessaloniki , Greece; Students","Ali, W., Nor, H., Hamzah, A., Alwi, H., The conditions and level of ICT integration in Malaysian Smart Schools (2009) International Journal of Education and Development using ICT, (IJEDICT), 5 (2), pp. 21-31; Alivisos, S., Apostolos, K., Pedagogically-Oriented Evaluation Criteria for Educational Web Resources (2009) eLearning Papers, 17. , http://www.elearningeuropa.info/files/media/media21214.pdf, December.

Entrepreneurship lacks an autonomous theoretical framework. Consequently, it is fostered through experiential learning techniques. The majority of entrepreneurial courses are based on collaborative business planning facilitated by business games. Such games simulate the creation of a new business venture supporting the financial calculations, profit inference, sensitivity analysis and risk analysis. The present case study presents a newly developed online platform which facilitates the collaboration of organic groups in producing the business plan of a new virtual firm. The whole game simulates the learning process that is followed in entrepreneurial courses at the University of Athens for the last years. As an effective tool for blended learning, the platform supports a simultaneous participation of groups and tutors from different departments and universities whereas autonomous collaboration inside groups and collective collaboration/teaching inside courses are possible. Results are open to the participants for inter-comparisons and peer assessment. Online communication amongst users is asynchronous and can be administrated by the tutors. Based on open-ended problem solving, the new educational tool aims to accommodate the future development of curricular entrepreneurial courses, online courses to the public and to also support the encouragement of youth entrepreneurship through the career services of the university.","Blended learning; Collaborative learning; Experiential learning; New business simulator; Online platforms","Curricula; Education; Learning systems; Planning; Problem solving; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Sensitivity analysis; Social networking (online); Teaching; Blended learning; Collaborative learning; Entrepreneurship education; Experiential learning; New business ventures; On-line communication; Online platforms; Open-ended problem solving; E-learning","Abt, C., (1970) Serious Games, , The Viking Press, New York; Bygrave, W.D., Hofer, C.W., Theorizing About Entrepreneurship (1991) Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice, 16 (2), pp. 13-22; Collins, L.A., Smith, A.J., Hannon, P.D., Applying a synergistic learning approach in Entrepreneurship education (2006) Management Learning, 37 (3), pp. 335-354; Csikszentmihalyi, M., Beyond boredom and anxiety (1975), Jossey-Bass, San Francisco; Csikszentmihalyi, M., (1991) Flow: The psychology of optimal experience, , Harper Perennial, New York; Survey of Entrepreneurship Education in Higher Education in Europe (2008), http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/entrepreneurship/support_measures/training_education/highedsurvey.pdf, online, NIRAS Consultants, FORA, ECON Pöyry; Fiet, J.O., The theoretical side of teaching entrepreneurship (2001) Journal of Business Venturing, 16 (1), pp. 1-24; Honig, B., Entrepreneurship Education: Toward a Model of Contingency-Based Business Planning (2004) Academy of Management Learning and Education, 3 (3), pp. 258-273; Kakouris, A., On initial implementations of innovation and entrepreneurship courses: a case study for undergraduates at the University of Athens (2008), pp. 121-129. , Paper read at 3nd European Conference on Entrepreneurship and Innovation, Academic Conferences Limited., Reading, UK; Kakouris, A., Online platforms for entrepreneurship education: an instructional design approach (2009), pp. 230-235. , Paper read at 4th European Conference on Entrepreneurship and Innovation, Academic Conferences Limited, Reading, UK; Kiili, K., Digital game-based learning: toward an experiential gaming model (2005) Internet and Higher Education, 8, pp. 13-24; Kolb, D.A., Experiential learning experience as a source of learning and development (1984), Prentice Hall, New Jersey; Kruijne, C., Teaching entrepreneurs continuous adaptation (2007), Paper read at 2nd European Conference on Entrepreneurship and Innovation, Academic Conferences Limited., Reading, UK, November; Lave, J., Wenger, E., Situated Learning (1991) Legitimate peripheral participation, , University of Cambridge Press, Cambridge; Marsick, V., O'Neill, J., The many faces of action learning (1999) Management Learning, 30 (2), pp. 159-176; McGrath, R.G., MacMillan, I.C., The Entrepreneurial Mindset (2000), Harvard Business School Press, Boston MA; Minniti, M., Bygrave, W., A dynamic model of entrepreneurial learning (2001) Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice, 25 (3), pp. 5-16; Oslo Agenda for Entrepreneurship Education in Europe (2006), http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/entrepreneurship/support_measures/training_education/doc/oslo_agenda_final.pdf, online, European Commission; Politis, D., The Process of entrepreneurial learning: a conceptual framework (2005) Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice, 29 (4), pp. 399-424; Prensky, M., (2001) Digital game-based learning, , McGraw-Hill, New York; Rasmussen, E.A., Sørheim, R., Action-based entrepreneurship education (2006) Technovation, 26 (2), pp. 185-194; Singh, H., Building Effective Blended Learning Programs (2003) Educational Technology, 43 (6), pp. 51-54; Schön, D., (1983) The reflective practitioner, , Basic Books, New York; Ucbasaran, D., Westhead, P., Wright, M., (2006) Habitual Entrepreneurs, , Edward Elgar, Aldershot",20490992,9781908272188,,"English",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84938563813

During this time I have been immersing myself in the online environment and grappling to figure out what academic blogging means to me. To offer the reader a rich insight into this experience I present a reflective account together with an analysis of these formative experiences of social media. Higher Education (HE) in the Western world is currently grappling to position itself in a shifting landscape of economic rationalisation, too-fast-to-keep-up technological innovation, and escalating marketisation (OLTF 2011). Blended learning and social media are being explored as potential solutions to these pressures. In this paper I explore the potential opportunities and challenges afforded by academic blogging for professional development. The concepts I have used as a framework for discussion are: exposure, engagement and networking. It is argued that these features combined with the non-hierarchical structure of social media (Siemens and Weller 2011) mean that academic blogging has the potential to create a self-organising, highly responsive and digitally reflexive staff, for a relatively low cost. However, not all academics or institutions will be comfortable with the time investment or risk associated with writing in the public domain. However, if institutions refuse to accept blogging as a form of scholarly activity then academics may struggle to position themselves as public intellectuals in the digital age (Kirkup 2010).","Academic scholarship; Blogging; Online identity; Professional development; Social media","Amphibious vehicles; Blogs; E-learning; Professional aspects; Social networking (online); Academic scholarship; Blogging; Online identity; Professional development; Social media; Education","Davies, J., Merchant, G., Looking from the inside out: academic blogging as new literacy (2007) A new literacies sampler, pp. 119-167. , Lankshear, C and Knobel, M (eds.), New York, Peter Lang; Hayler, M., Autoethnography: making memory methodology (2010) Research in Education (R.Ed), 3 (1), pp. 5-9; Kirkup, G., Academic blogging: academic practice and academic identity (2010) London Review of Education, 8 (1), pp. 75-84; Kjellberg, S., I am a blogging researcher: Motivations for blogging in a scholarly context (2010) First Monday, 15 (8); Mackey, J., Evans, T., Interconnecting networks of practice for professional learning (2011) International Review of Research in Open and Distance Learning, 12 (3), pp. 1-18; Mccrea, P., Unconventional approach to a paper about blogging (2011) Learnerosity [Blog], , http://is.gd/Xi4FxU, accessed 01/06/11; (2011) Collaborate to compete: seizing the opportunity of online learning for UK higher education, , http://is.gd/e5Efk7, Online, accessed 06/03/11; Pachler, N., Daly, C., Narrative and learning with Web 2.0 technologies: towards a research agenda (2009) Journal of Computer Assisted Learning, 25 (1), pp. 6-18; Siemens, G., Weller, M., Higher education and the promises and perils of social networks (2011) Revista de Universidad y Sociedad del Conocimiento (RUSC), 8 (1), pp. 117-164",20490992,9781908272225,,"English",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84939218351

However, there is little guidance in the form of frameworks for the development of online assessment strategies.

It is the research and preparation which forms the basis of this paper. The focus for this paper was about finding the right balance of e-learning to support learners during their UG experience, with a view to progressing them from passive to active and independent learners. The principal pedagogical strategy is to be collaborative enquiry-based learning and this research was to identify appropriate blended strategies and technologies which would enhance and complement this approach. The concept of collaborative learning indicates that consideration must be given to the formation and development of groups for working in both physical and virtual environments. Both will bring their own challenges but consideration is given to how these will be addressed throughout the lifetime of the programme. The plethora of research into E and blended learning advises that learning with technology needs to be driven by pedagogical principles, including the specific skills that these new learners will require in order to cope with and enjoy the new approach of enquiry-based learning, not normally associated with UG business students. The development required a review of the current technologies available at UoB, alternative technologies and how they are being utilised and incorporated by colleagues in other institutions, together with ways of introducing them to the learners. The research also explored whether or not there should be an overlapping of educational and recreational technologies and is it right to mix. Final attention was given to the assessment of the students, how frequently this should occur and how much should be formative or summative, what format it would take and how much of it would be the responsibility of the tutors. Some of the technologies and collaborative learning were already integrated into the current business programme at UoB and provided useful evaluation from observations of the students together with their feedback. This provided some useful understanding of what their expectations were as well as identifying specific requirements prior to starting any activities.","Blended; Collaborative; Curriculum design, action learning; Problem-based learning","Curricula; E-learning; Education; Learning systems; Students; Teaching; Virtual reality; Action learning; Alternative technologies; Blended; Collaborative; Enquiry-based learning; Pedagogical principles; Pedagogical strategies; Problem based learning; Engineering education","Benn, A., Changes Facing Higher Education - Opportunity or Challenge?

According to the UK National Student Survey (NSS) which gives final year undergraduates the chance to reflect on their course and to have their views heard, students are markedly less positive about feedback on their assessments than about other aspects of their learning experience. Thus, there is strong rationale to provide more effective feedback that enhances understanding and learning by exploiting the potential benefits that Technology Enhanced Learning (TEL) has to offer, whilst reducing the burden on tutors as being the sole providers of feedback (Sadler 2010). These issues are addressed in this research, which is a small-scale evaluation project using a mixture of quantitative and qualitative methods, exploring the role of technology in the process of giving and receiving feedback on the final year BSc. (Hons) Computing programme at Leeds Metropolitan University (Leeds Met). The primary data is obtained from a mixed method approach using questionnaires and interviews. The research findings suggest that although tutors apply a variety of feedback mechanisms dependent upon the nature of the learning, teaching and assessment (LTA) design of their modules, students do not hold a uniform view of what effective feedback means and how it could be used to enhance their understanding and learning. It is also found that students perceive feedback as being useful when it is mediated through a guided dialogic process where a common consensus is more likely to be arrived at. It is interesting to note that characteristics of effective feedback in face-to-face delivery are not diminished in blended learning delivery. The results have implications for increasing awareness in students on how to recognise what constitutes feedback, as well as how to use it. The results also support the evidence that when technologies that maximise dialogue and learning as shared discussion of tasks are used appropriately, the emphasis shifts from delivering instruction to producing learning. Further, the findings propose that in supporting time-starved tutors who are under pressure to provide effective feedback, the pedagogic opportunities that technology affords can be suitably harnessed for collaborative learning, in particular self and peer feedback provision. Within Higher Education (HE) curricula, this translates as an opportunity to promote self-regulation through independence and personal ownership of learning, increasing students' ability to self-assess and self-correct, skills which form the hallmarks of undergraduate education. The paper concludes with recommendations to influence existing feedback practices through technology-supported activities to benefit students' learning experiences.","Exemplars; Peer feedback; Self-regulation; Technology-enhanced feedback","Curricula; Deregulation; E-learning; Education; Engineering education; Surveys; Teaching; Exemplars; Peer feedback; Quantitative and qualitative methods; Self regulation; Students' learning experiences; Teaching and assessments; Technology enhanced learning; Undergraduate education; Students","Bangert-Drowns, R.L., Kulick, J.A., Morgan, M.T., The instructional effect of feedback in test-like events (1991) Review of Educational Research, 61 (2), pp. 213-238; Bangert, A.W., The Development and Validation of the Student Evaluation of Online Teaching Effectiveness (2008) Computers in the Schools, 25 (1), pp. 25-47; Bolton, P., Changes to higher education funding and student support from 2012/13 (2011), www.parliament.uk/briefingpapers/commons/lib/research/.../snsg-05753.pdf, online; Boud, D., (1995) Enhancing learning through self assessment, , Kogan Page, London; Boud, D., Sustainable assessment: rethinking assessment for the learning society (2000) Studies in the Continuing Education, 22 (2), pp. 151-167; Franklin, T., van Harmelen, M., (2007) Web 2.0 for Content for Learning and Teaching in Higher Education, , Joint Information Systems Committee, London; Fritz, C.O., Morris, P.E., Bjork, R.A., Gelman, R., Wickens, T.D., When further learning fails: stability and change following repeated presentation of text (2000) British Journal of Psychology, 91, pp. 493-511; Garrison, D.R., Anderson, T., (2003) E-learning in the 21st century, , RouteledgeFalmer, London; Knight, P., Yorke, M., (2003) Assessment, learning and employability, , SRHE/Open University Press, Maidenhead; Martin, A., Madigan, D., (2006) Digital literacies for learning, , Facet Publishing, London; Nicol, D., Macfarlane-Dick, D., Formative assessment and self-regulated learning: A model and seven principles of good feedback practice (2006) Studies in Higher Education, 34 (1), pp. 199-218; Nicol, D., From monologue to dialogue: improving written feedback processes in mass higher education (2010) Assessment & Evaluation in Higher Education, 35 (5), pp. 501-517; Offir, B., Lev, Y., Bezalel, R., Surface and deep learning processes in distance education: Synchronous versus asynchronous systems (2008) Computers and Education, 51 (3), pp. 1172-1183; Palloff, R.M., Pratt, K., (2007) Building Online Learning Communities: Effective strategies for the virtual classroom, , Jossey-Bass, San Francisco; Prensky, M., Digital Natives, Digital Immigrants, On the Horizon (2001), http://tinyurl.com/ypgvf, online; Reushle, S., Loch, B., Conducting a trial of web conferencing software: Why, how, and perceptions from the Coalface (2008) Turkish Online Journal of Distance Education, 9 (3), pp. 19-28; Rotheram, B., (2008) Towards quicker, better assessment using audio feedback, , www.caaconference.com/pastConferences/.../Rotherham_B_formatted_b2.pdf, online, CAA Conference 2008, Loughborough University; Sadler, D.R., Emphatically, not to judge?

Institutional, national and global pressures demand that universities address issues of quality in teaching and learning. Universities are challenged to adapt their role to a new reality where two of the main concepts in this context are lifelong learning and mobility, which underlie the commitment of several European HE institutions following the Bologna Process. The purpose of this article is to examine the evaluation practices of teaching and learning in Portuguese Higher Education blended learning modules. Questions like who evaluates, how to evaluate, what is evaluated and what evaluation is for and also what should be implemented in order to improve course quality were put to the directors of the courses under scrutiny. The study was conducted with 18 of a total of 19 bLearning course directors in 11 Portuguese HE institutions. Results revealed that students, teachers and directors are the main performers of modules evaluation, although external agents are also seen as very relevant for this purpose in the near future. The main instruments used for evaluation are reports about the course and questionnaires to students. As to the objects of evaluation that are being selected in Portuguese institutions all directors mentioned the communication tools used, the quality of didactic materials and the pertinence of the learning tasks proposed, all of them also seen as most pertinent for the purposes of evaluation. The main goals of evaluation are the improvement of the curricular plans and the adequacy of the teaching strategies. Some recommendations of new methodologies for evaluation are put forward with the aim of improving HE teaching quality. © 2010 IADIS.","Blended learning; Evaluation; Higher Education","Blended learning; Bologna process; Communication tools; Didactic materials; Evaluation; External agents; Higher Education; Learning tasks; Life long learning; Portugal; Teaching and learning; Teaching quality; Teaching strategy; Computer science; E-learning; Engineering education; Information systems; Rating; Societies and institutions; Students; Surveys; Teaching","Bliuc, A.-M., Goodyear, P., Ellis, R.A., Research focus and methodological choices in studies into students' experiences of blended learning in higher education (2007) Internet and Higher Education, 10 (4), pp. 231-244. , DOI 10.1016/j.iheduc.2007.08.001, PII S1096751607000516; Carneiro, R., (2003) A Evolução Do E-Learning em Portugal, , INOFOR, Lisbon, Portugal; Conole, G., Designing for learning (2007) Contemporary Perspectives in E-learning Research - Themes, Methods and Impact on Practice, pp. 101-120. , Conole, G. and Oliver M.

As such a teacher's planning should provide opportunities for both learner and teacher to obtain and use information about progress towards learning goals. It also has to be flexible to respond to emerging ideas such as elearning and blended learning. Planning should include strategies to ensure that learners understand the goals they are pursuing and the criteria that will be applied in assessing their work. Much of what teachers and learners do in classrooms can be described as assessment. These assessment processes are an essential part of everyday classroom practice and involve both teachers and learners in reflection, dialogue and decision making. However, many learners have problems with assessment. For example, what exactly is required, concentration, exam phobia, stress, problems with self-confidence and group-work problems. Furthermore, over the past few years innovations such as blended learning and consequently blended assessment have become more popular with educators. As such, these issues conspire to confuse and possibly disorientate the student. How can they cope with all these aspects of learning, teaching, assessment and then revision? In an effort to understand these problems facing today's learners, this paper discusses the research project currently being undertaken by the author to establish the benefits of developing a 'blended e-revision' framework and package to assist a group of third year undergraduate students at Glasgow Caledonian University (GCU). This package is intended to guide the student through the assessment and examination processes on their module enabling them to access technology enhanced revision materials, for both coursework and examination at any time. Easily accessible, this new facility should provide students with an avenue to do their revision activities more effectively. © 2010 IADIS.","Assessment; Blended e-revision strategy; Blended learning; Technology enhanced learning","Access technology; Assessment; Assessment process; Blended e-revision strategy; Blended learning; Classroom practices; Effective planning; Examination process; Learning goals; Student assessment; Technology enhanced learning; Undergraduate students; Computer science; Decision making; E-learning; Information systems; Learning systems; Rating; School buildings; Students; Teaching; Engineering education","Dochy, F., 'Learning lasting for life' and 'assessment': How far did we progress?

Blended instruction has mainly involved the instructor making decisions regarding the combination of online and in-class learning activities required for the course. Recently, an innovative blended model, hyflex learning, has begun to emerge. Hyflex learning incorporates blended learning characteristics with a more flexible framework. With this model, each student and not the instructor, elects the combination of activities they believe will best meet their learning needs. This study explores the extent to which students' needs and expectations are met in this type of environment. In addition, instructor's perspectives regarding participation and performance in hyflex classes compared to previously taken face-to-face classes will be examined. © 2010 i-Society.",,"Blended delivery; Blended learning; Flexible environments; Flexible framework; Higher education; In-class learning; Making decision; Student satisfaction; Teaching and learning; E-learning; Information science; Students; Teaching; Education computing","Allen, I.E., Seaman, J., Garrett, R., (2007) Blending In: The Extent and Promise of Blended Education in the United States, , Needham, MA: The Sloan-C Consortium; Allen, I.E., Seaman, J., (2008) Staying the Course: Online Education in the United States, 2008, , Needham, MA: The Sloan-C Consortium; Beatty, B., Transitioning to an online world: Using hyFlex courses to bridge the gap (2007) Proceedings of World Conference on Educational Multimedia, Hypermedia and Telecommunications 2007, pp. 2701-2706. , C.

This process however requires specialized software to be used by a university. The paper tackles issues related with this approach and presents guidelines for construction of a framework for creating web-based education support software in quantitative area - the meta-framework that allows for a rapid construction of web-based educational decision analysis software. The framework design in paper covers three aspect: (1) information system modeling, (2) decision problem modeling and (3) teaching process modeling. The information system modeling includes system architecture, servers, programming languages and technical design. The decision problem modeling provides means to present an abstract decision problem (and more generally - a problem where quantitative methods can be used) and to model interaction between software and decision maker (i.e. a student learning a decision algorithm). Teaching process modeling includes support for linear teaching algorithm in the decision making process, further this can be extended into non-linear and hybrid teaching algorithms. As a proof of concept a working framework prototype named Combine! will be presented. The software's usefulness was evaluated through a survey carried out on 234 students at Warsaw School of Economics. © Tomasz Szapiro, Przemysław Szufel, 2010.","Decision support; Distance education; E-learning; Operations research",,"Bates, T., The promise and myths of e-learning in post-secondary education (2004) The Network Society: A Cross-cultural Perspective, pp. 271-292. , w: M.

In addition, due to national education policy and universities' regulations, pure online courses are not permitted in Taiwan. In order to design appropriate blended learning (BL) courses, the author explored the effects of web-mediated self-regulated learning (SRL) with variations in online class frequency on enhancing students' computing skills and their perspective of the blended courses. A total of 172 students, divided into four groups, participated in the experiment. The results showed that students in the SRL and BL group with five online classes had the highest scores for using a database management system (DBMS), and the highest pass rate on certificated examinations. Students in this group also expressed their positive perspective on the arrangement of their blended course with the intervention of web-mediated SRL. © Copyright 2010, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",,"article; attitude; curriculum; educational status; female; human; learning; male; methodology; psychological aspect; student; Taiwan; teaching; vocational education; Attitude; Computer-Assisted Instruction; Curriculum; Educational Status; Female; Humans; Learning; Male; Students; Taiwan; Teaching; Vocational Education","Means, B., Toyama, Y., Murphy, R., Evaluation of Evidencebased Practices in Online Learning: A Meta-analysis and Review of Online Learning Studies, , http://www.ed.gov/rschstat/eval/tech/evidence-basedpractices/finalreport. pdf, U.S. Department of Education. accessed Sep. 27, 2009; Shen, P.D., Lee, T.H., Tsai, C.W., Facilitating students to pass certificate tests via blended e-learning with self-regulated learning: A quasi-experimental approach (2007) WSEAS Proceedings on Multimedia Internet & Video Technologies, , http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1347859, accessed Sep. 27, 2009; Lai, S.Q., Lee, C.L., Yeh, Y.J., A study of satisfaction in blended learning for small and medium enterprises (2005) International Journal of Innovation & Learning, 2, pp. 319-334; Boyle, T., Bradley, C., Chalk, P., Using blended learning to improve student success rates in learning to program (2003) Learning, Media & Technology, 28, pp. 165-178; Azevedo, R., Using hypermedia as a metacognitive tool for enhancing student learninǧThe role of self-regulated learning (2005) Educational Psychologist, 40, pp. 199-209; Lee, T.H., Shen, P.D., Tsai, C.W., Enhancing computing skills of low-achieving students via e-learning: A design experiment of web-based, problem-based learning and selfregulated learning (2008) CyberPsychology & Behavior, 11, pp. 431-436; Johnson, M., Liber, O., The personal learning environment and the human condition: From theory to teaching practice (2008) Interactive Learning Environments, 16, pp. 3-15; Nückles, M., Hübner, S., Renkl, A., Enhancing self-regulated learning by writing learning protocols (2009) Learning & Instruction, 19, pp. 259-271; Chang, M.M., Applying self-regulated learning strategies in a web-based instruction-An investigation of motivation perception (2005) Computer Assisted Language Learning, 18, pp. 217-230; Greene, J.A., Azevedo, R., Adolescents' use of self-regulatory processes and their relation to qualitative mental model shifts while using hypermedia (2007) Journal of Educational Computing Research, 36, pp. 125-148; Shen, P.D., Lee, T.H., Tsai, C.W., Applying web-enabled problembased learning and self-regulated learning to enhance computing skills of Taiwan's vocational students: A quasiexperimental study of a short-term module (2007) Electronic Journal of E-Learning, 5, pp. 147-156; Zimmerman, B.J., Bonner, S., Kovach, R., (1996) Developing Self-regulated Learners: Beyond Achievement to Self-efficacy, , Washington, DC: American Psychological Association; Mhm, S., A study of EFL technological and vocational college students' language learning strategies and their selfperceived English proficiency (2005) Electronic Journal of Foreign Language Teaching, 2, pp. 44-56; Chen, C.H., Tien, C.J., (2005) Market Segmentation Analysis for Taking Skill Test by Students in An Institute of Technology, , http://www.voced.edu.au/td/tnc_85.574, accessed Sep. 27, 2009; Yang, S.C., Tung, C.J., Comparison of Internet addicts and nonaddicts in Taiwanese high school (2007) Computers in Human Behavior, 23, pp. 79-96; Tsai, C.W., The effects of feedback in the implementation of web-mediated self-regulated learning CyberPsychology & Behavior, , in press; Gribbons, B., Herman, J., True and quasi-experimental designs (1997) Practical Assessment, Research & Evaluation, p. 5. , http://PAREonline.net/getvn.asp?v=5&n=14, accessedSep. 27, 2009",21522715,,,"English",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-77958186655

A blended learning approach based on lecture recordings has been developed over the years in which the audio and video recordings substitute the classroom lectures. Building blocks of that concept are podcasts, web lectures, electronic examinations and coaching sessions. In an intensive evaluation, advantages and drawbacks of the concept could be identified. With the integration of a classical instrument for teaching evaluation - Small Group Instructional Diagnosis (SGID) - we try to offer ways to overcome these drawbacks.

The question is whether this will really contribute to creating a community in a situation where people have little opportunities to have contact and exchange ideas and practices. Tutor support and careful induction sessions will help make everyone more comfortable with the new technology by showing the opportunities it opens up. Design/methodology/approach: The evidence taken into consideration refers to the initial phases of the project: leading a needs assessment survey and introducing library staff to the new system, both as learners and teachers. Courses have been organized and surveys have been drawn to collect the participants' impressions. Findings: Actually, it seems that learning is enhanced when related to real situations, and so is interaction and involvement of participants, notwithstanding age and background differences: this seems to be even more true for online environments. Research limitations/implications: This is a report about a particular experience from which is drawn a series of considerations useful for practice: it is not intended as a wide scope study on e-learning application to workplace learning and development. Practical implications: The experience described here builds up a basis for a new mode of delivering learning experiences at work, while at the same time trying to create a sense of belonging and community. Originality/value: Though not aiming at drawing conclusive statements on the subject, the paper analyzes the impact of blended learning in an organizational environment where differences in age, education and relative isolation of single workers are the rule. This applies to most library systems and larger organizations, therefore the experience can build up a basis for critical thought in sketching workplace development plans for larger libraries and library systems. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Academic libraries; E-learning; Employee development; Workplace learning",,"Appelbaum, S.H., Serena, M., Shapiro, B.T., Generation X and the boomers: Organizational myths and literary realities (2005) Management Research News, 28 (1), pp. 1-33; Cennamo, L., Gardner, D., Generational differences in work values, outcomes and person-organisation values fit (2008) Journal of Managerial Psychology, 23 (8), pp. 891-906; Fontanin, M., Developing an English course for in-service librarians: The advantages of blended learning (2008) Library Management, 29 (8-9), pp. 777-788; Fontanin, M., Švab, M., Applying Moodle to continuing professional development.

The interpretive work draws on four action research cycles conducted over two years with two student cohorts. Discussion is based on observations, staff and student focus groups and interviews examining the students’ expectations and experiences. The initial focus of the action research was on the introduction of technology into the teaching and learning experience. However, the advantage of an interpretive approach is allowing the findings to determine the course of the research. During the first action research cycles, the focus of the research changed from the use of technology in blended learning to the role of the practitioners involved. The authors advocate the key role of reflective practitioners in facilitating blended learning and suggest that action research is a useful framework. © 2010, IGI Global.

Most surveys measure responses to questions which are based on students' subjective impressions. The purpose of this study is to examine participants' assessments made during the transitional phase in a blended learning environment at a Japanese national university. Students were enrolled in two-unit bachelor or master's courses which were taught by the same professor and were blended learning courses. Students attended face-to-face classes and were also able to access on-line content outside of class. The total number of students with valid survey data was 159 (67 bachelors and 92 masters). A survey questionnaire which consisted of 10 questions measured the self-assessment of students' on-line learning experience. E-learning evaluation, learning habits and learning strategies, three factors used for evaluating learning experiences, were then extracted and compared between questionnaire surveys. There are no significant differences in all factor scores between the beginnings and the ends of the courses, but there are significant differences in the third factor score, learning strategies, between bachelor and master's students at both the beginnings and the ends of the courses. These results show the coherence of learners' assessments during the course. According to the study results, it is assumed that students make their own evaluations during the course. The correlation coefficients of the first factor scores (e-learning evaluation) between the beginnings and the ends of the courses are not high, however (bachelor: r = 0.46, masters: r = 0.35). Therefore, some participants have changed their evaluation between the two surveys. When the differences in factor scores between the initial and final surveys are compared between high and low raters at the beginning of the course, the scores for the high raters decreases and the scores for low raters increases. These results suggest that low raters at the beginnings of the courses have become satisfied with the blended learning environment, while the high raters have become discouraged.","Assessment in transition; Blended learning; Learner assessment; On-line learning","Computer aided instruction; Learning systems; Students; Surveys; Assessment in transition; Blended learning; Blended learning environments; Correlation coefficient; Learner assessment; Online learning; Questionnaire surveys; Subjective impressions; E-learning","Anderson, J., Brown, G., Spaeth, S., Online student evaluations and responses rates reconsidered (2006) Innovate, 2 (6). , http://www.innovateonline.info; Bates, A.W., (1999) Managing Technological Change, Strategies for College and University Leaders, , Jossey-Bass Publishers, San Francisco, USA; Coolican, H., (1994) Research Methods and Statistics in Psychology, , Hodder & Stoughton, London, UK; Craig, A., Goold, A., Coldwell, J., Mustard, J., Perceptions of roles and responsibilities in online learning: A case study (2008) Interdisciplinary Journal of E-Learning and Learning Object, 4, pp. 205-223; Deepwell, F., Embedding quality in e-learning implementation through evaluation (2007) Educational Technology & Society, 10 (2), pp. 34-43; Haebara, T., Ichikawa, S., Shimoyama, H., (2001) Introduction to Research Methods in Psychology, Surveys, Experiments and Practices, , University of Tokyo Press, Tokyo Japan; Harrington, C.F., Reasons, S.G., Online student evaluation of teaching for distance education: A perfect match?

The programme has been delivered for over six years to work-based students both in the UK and at several overseas locations. The aim of this research is to examine the students' experiences and evaluate the effectiveness of the course delivery system that has been in place, and to identify scope for further improvement. The primary research method was two sets of questionnaire surveys conducted over a two-year period among students taking the course at both the home and overseas sites. The first set of surveys showed a high level of student satisfaction with the programme as delivered, but also indicated areas that could see further improvement. The impacts of the subsequent changes in both the programme and the blended learning support system were further investigated in a second set of surveys. The findings from this research have helped improve the blended learning approach, and enhanced the quality of the programme. It is hoped, in addition, that these findings can provide guidelines for other universities that offer, or intend to offer, blended learning courses in a global context.","Blended learning; ELearning; Perceptions","Distance education; E-learning; Research; Sensory perception; Surveys; Blended learning; Course delivery; Learning support systems; Overseas locations; Questionnaire surveys; research methods; Student satisfaction; Teaching and learning; Students","Bentley, Y., Shegunshi, A., Scannell, M., Evaluating the impact of distance learning support systems on the learning experience of MBA students in a global context (2010) Electronic Journal of ELearning (EJEL), 8 (2), pp. 51-62. , www.ejel.org, 2010 Academic Conferences Limited, England; Buzzetto-More, N., Student perceptions of various ELearning components (2008) Interdisciplinary Journal of Knowledge and Learning Objects, 4, pp. 113-135; Deepwell, F., Embedding quality in eLearning implementation through evaluation (2007) Journal of Educational Technology & Society, 10 (2), pp. 34-43; Goold, A., Craig, A., Coldwell, J., Accommodating culture and cultural diversity in online teaching (2007) Australasian Journal of Educational Technology, 23 (4), pp. 490-507; Gurǎu, C., Drillon, D., Evaluating the effectiveness of an international eLearning system: The case of montpellier business school (2009) Proceedings of the International Conference on ELearning, pp. 174-181. , 2009; Guri-Rosenblit, S., Distance education in the digital age: Common misconceptions and challenging tasks (2009) Journal of Distance Education, 23 (2), pp. 105-112; Jara, M., Mellar, H., Quality enhancement for eLearning courses: The role of student feedback (2010) Computers and Education, 54 (3), pp. 709-714; Technology enhanced learning environments (2007) JISC ELearning Programme, , http://www.elearning.ac.uk/subjects/PLE, accessed on 22 may 2009; Kidney, G., Cummings, L., Boehm, A., Toward a quality assurance approach to ELearning courses (2007) International Journal on ELearning, 6 (1), pp. 17-30; Lam, P., Bordia, S., Factors affecting student choice of eLearning over traditional learning: Student and teacher perspectives (2008) International Journal of Learning, 14 (12), pp. 131-139; Lapointe, L., Reisetter, M., Belonging online: Students' perceptions of the value and efficacy of an online learning community (2008) International Journal on ELearning, 7 (4), pp. 641-665; Martínez-Argüelles, M., Castán, J., Juan, A., How do students measure service quality in eLearning?

In the majority of cases, these systems have logging capabilities to audit and monitor the processes they support. At the level of a university, administrative information systems collect information about students, their enrollment in particular programs and courses, and performance like examination grades. In addition, the information about the lectures, instructors, study programs, courses, and prerequisites are typically available as well. These data can be analyzed from various levels and perspectives, showing different aspects of organization, and giving us more insight into the overall educational system. From the level of an individual course, we can consider participation in lectures, accomplishing assignments, and enrolling in midterm and final exams. However, with the development and increasing popularity of blended learning and e-learning, information systems enable us to capture activities also at different levels of granularity. Besides more traditional tasks like overall student performance or dropout prediction [1], it becomes possible to track how different learning resources (videolectures, handouts, wikis, hypermedia, quizzes) are used [2], how students progress with (software) project assignments (svn commits) [3], and self-assessment test and questionnaires [4]. © 2010 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,"Benoit, G., Data mining (2002) Annu.

Implementing CBA at an institutional level raises several issues. Supporting staff, if existing, have to address and solve some hard challenges: pedagogical training in new assessment methods, technical problems in the implementation process and organizational problems. These last are particularly complex in a university campus like U.PORTO: large and spread. The e-Assessment topic is of general interest for those who work in eLearning, specially now in the era of Web 2.0, where many questions arise due to so many different approaches of methodology, strategies and evaluation. U.PORTO is no exception. The need of being more accurate in the assessment process when using the web, even if the teachers use a blended-learning approach, is real and work is being developed in order to try to respond to this need. Although the eLearning Unit (GATIUP) works towards different assessment methods, this particular paper focus on the implementation of online tests on campus using the University LMS - Moodle. We will explore the experience acquired in implementing large scale high stake examinations in different faculties: Pharmacy, Economics, Medicine, Dentistry, Humanities. On the school year of 2008/2009, 1548 students did their high stake exams online; in 2009/2010 only in the first semester 869 students were evaluated and graded on Moodle. Also, test analysis has been conducted with interesting information about the items and the quality of the overall exam. It will also be presented the strategies that U.PORTO is engaging to overcome some of the difficulties found in the implementation of such project.","Assessment; Classical test theory; Moodle; Multiple-choice questions","Computer aided analysis; Information technology; Medicine; Personnel training; Teaching; Assessment; Classical tests; Computer-based assessments; Information and Communication Technologies; Interesting information; Moodle; Multiple-choice questions; Organizational problems; Quality control","Ellis, R.A., Jarkey, N., Mahony, M.J., Peat, M., Sheely, S., Managing quality improvement of eLearning in a large, campus-based university (2007) Quality Assurance in Education, 15, pp. 9-23; Falcão, R., (2006) ELearning at the University of Porto from 1998-2005: Implementing ELearning at a Traditional University, , http://www.ai.tuwienac.at/elearning/innovation_lecture; (2008) FastTest Pro, , http://www.assess.com/FastTEST.html, [Computer program].

Similar to this, in the Czech Republic strong emphasis has been put on education and improving competences in the field of ICT and foreign languages since the beginning of this century. These decisions led to substantial changes in the educational concept on university level. A wide range of agreement and disagreement with new educational approaches could be seen both across the whole system and insight single institutions. Teams were established dealing with the process of eLearning implementation in the tertiary education, at the beginning being very informal, joining enthusiasts, and their activities were hardly supported. Pioneering eLearning activities in this period were usually financed from various, mostly European projects. Despite the starting troubles the awareness of possibilities provided by eLearning was spreading slowly but steadily. Nowadays there exist university departments specialized in eLearning and its implementation into the process of instruction. There was also established a system for funding eLearning activities so it does not depend on random effort of single employees any more. These trends have step by step resulted in both quantitative increase in ICT implementation and related activities in tertiary education, and in substantial shift in quality of formal and informal view on eLearning. Despite the starting problems in the last decade, eLearning has become a standard in tertiary education. The eLearning forms of instruction at universities can be used in both gradual study programmes and lifelong education. eLearning can be applied in the distance study programmes, in the combined (part-time) form of instruction or supporting present lessons (blended learning). In 2009 a research ""Evaluation of the modern technologies contributing towards forming and development university studentś competences"" focusing on eLearning implementation at Czech universities started, being supported by the Czech Science Foundation. There are 26 public universities accredited in the Czech Republic. Annual reports of these universities were the main source of information for this research.","eLearning; eLearning polices; Infrastructure; Learning Management System; Research; University education","E-learning; Research; Societies and institutions; Educational approach; European Commission; Infrastructure; Learning management system; Life-long educations; Public universities; University education; University students; Education","Annual repots of AMU, AVU, CVUT, CZU, JAMU, JCU, MUNI, MZLU, OSU, UPCE, UPOL, SLU, TU, UHK, UJEP, UK, UTB, VFU, VUT, VSB-TU, VSE, VSPJI, VSCHT, VŠUP, VSTE, ZCU, 1999-2009; (1993) Growth, Competitiveness, and Employment.

It is generally observed that a considerable number of university students in the Czech Republic use online communication tools and feel comfortable keeping in touch with other people by means of computer mediated communication. However, not only these productive skills, but also soft skills, such as the ability to work collaboratively and to communicate in teams, should be developed at the tertiary level of education. This can be done mainly in the courses that focus on communication, including English language courses. The language component of communicative competence comprises not only grammatical and lexical knowledge, but also pragmatic competence, i. e. the ability to appropriately use language forms with particular communication purposes and the ability to interpret such forms correctly. Yet, in many English language courses, the ability to effectively communicate online is not paid much attention to, or is often reduced to language accuracy. Moreover, online textual communication is different from purely written communication, as well as from spoken face-to-face interaction, and these aspects of computer mediated communication should also be reflected in English language courses that prepare students to communicate online. This paper tries to offer certain possibilities to meet the above-mentioned requirements. It presents the results obtained in a pilot study on developing communicative competence in English language courses for university students at the Common European Framework of Reference (CEFR) A2 level. The aim of this paper is to clarify the key principles of developing communicative competence. Along with the theoretical basis, the methodology of designing online communicative tasks and using asynchronous discussion forums are introduced. Important characteristics of online communicative activities are discussed and the process of introducing, maintaining, closing and assessing online communicative activities is presented. Finally, the question whether the online communicative activities can lead to better comprehension as well as better production of the target language is answered on the basis of evaluation of reading and writing test results. Selected students' progress throughout the course is then evaluated, considering both qualitative and quantitative aspects of student participation in the communicative online activities.","Blended learning; Communicative competence; Computer-mediated communication (CMC); Discussion forums; English as a Foreign Language (EFL) learning","Curricula; Students; Blended learning; Communicative competences; Computer-mediated communication; Discussion forum; English-as-a-Foreign-Language; Communication","Bachman, L., (1990) Fundamental Considerations in Language Testing, , Oxford University Press, Oxford; Bachman, L., (2004) Statistical Analyses for Language Assessment, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; (2003) Cambridge Key English Test 2 with Answers: Examination Papers from the University of Cambridge ESOL Examinations, , Cambridge University Press Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; (2001) Common European Framework of Reference for Languages, , http://www.coe.int/t/dg4/linguistic/Source/Framework_EN.pdf; Černá, M., Blended learning experience in teacher education: The trainees' perspective (2009) Acta Didactica Napocensia, 2 (1), pp. 37-48. , March; Palloff, R.M., Pratt, K., (2007) Building Online Learning Communities: Effective Strategies for the Virtual Classroom, , 2nd ed.
