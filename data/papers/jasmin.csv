The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic radically impacts our lives, while the evolution dynamics of COVID-19 remain obscure. A time-dependent Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, and Recovered (SEIR) model was proposed and applied to fit and then predict the time series of COVID-19 evolution observed over the last three months (up to 3/22/2020) in China. The model results revealed that 1) the transmission, infection and recovery dynamics follow the integral-order SEIR model with significant spatiotemporal variations in the recovery rate, likely due to the continuous improvement of screening techniques and public hospital systems, as well as full city lockdowns in China, and 2) the evolution of number of deaths follows the time FDE, likely due to the time memory in the death toll. The validated SEIR model was then applied to predict COVID-19 evolution in the United States, Italy, Japan, and South Korea. In addition, a time FDE model based on the random walk particle tracking scheme, analogous to a mixing-limited bimolecular reaction model, was developed to evaluate non-pharmaceutical strategies to mitigate COVID-19 spread. Preliminary tests using the FDE model showed that self-quarantine may not be as efficient as strict social distancing in slowing COVID-19 spread. Therefore, caution is needed when applying FDEs to model the coronavirus outbreak, since specific COVID-19 kinetics may not exhibit nonlocal behavior. Particularly, the spread of COVID-19 may be affected by the rapid improvement of health care systems which may remove the memory impact in COVID-19 dynamics (resulting in a short-tailed recovery curve), while the death toll and mitigation of COVID-19 can be captured by the time FDEs due to the nonlocal, memory impact in fatality and human activities. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Biology; COVID-19; Fractional calculus; Fractional derivative equation; SEIR","Biology; Calculations; Diagnosis; Dynamics; Hospitals; Recovery; Bimolecular reaction models; Computational biology; Continuous improvements; Fractional derivative model; Fractional derivatives; Pharmaceutical strategies; Random walk particle tracking; Spatio-temporal variation; Continuous time systems","Lonescu, C., Lopes, A., Copot, D., Machado, J.A.T., Bates, J.H.T., The role of fractional calculus in modeling biological phenomena: A review (2019) Commun Nonlinear Sci Numer Simulat, 51, pp. 141-159; Magin, R.L., Fractional calculus models of complex dynamics in biological tissues (2010) Comput Math Appl, 59 (5), pp. 1586-1593; Atici, F.M., Sengul, S.S., Modeling with fractional difference equations (2010) J Math Anal Appl, 369 (1), pp. 1-9; Machado, J.A.T., Costa, A.C., Quelhas, M.D., Fractional dynamics in DNA (2011) Commun Nonlinear Sci Numer Simul, 16 (8), pp. 2963-2969; Petras, I., Magin, R.L., Simulation of drug uptake in a two compartmental fractional model for a biological system (2011) Commun Nonlinear Sci Numer Simul, 16 (12), pp. 4588-4595; Rihan, F.A., Baleanu, D., Lakshmanan, S., Rakkiyappan, R., On fractional SIRC model with salmonella bacterial infection (2014) Abstr Appl Anal, 2014; Shaha, K., Alqudah, M.A., Jarad, F., Abdeljawa, T., Semi-analytical study of Pine Wilt Disease model with convex rate under Caputo-Febrizio fractional order derivative (2020) Chaos Soliton Fract, 135; Jajarmi, A., Yusuf, A., Baleanu, D., Inc, M., A new fractional HRSV model and its optimal control: A non-singular operator approach (2020) Physica A, 547; Baleanu, D., Jajarmi, A., Sajjadi, S.S., Asad, J.H., The fractional features of a harmonic oscillator with position-dependent mass (2020) Commun Theor Phys, 72 (5); Baleanu, D., Jajarmi, A., Mohammadi, H., Rezapour, S., A new study on the mathematical modelling of human liver with Caputo-Fabrizio fractional derivative (2020) Chaos Soliton Fract, 134; Yildiz, T.A., Jajarmi, A., Yildiz, B., Baleanu, D., New aspects of time fractional optimal control problems within operators with nonsingular kernel (2020) Discrete Cont Dyn, 13 (3), pp. 407-428; Baleanu, D., Jajarmi, A., Sajjadi, S.S., Mozyrska, D., A new fractional model and optimal control of a tumor-immune surveillance with non-singular derivative operator (2019) Chaos, 29 (8); (2020), https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html, Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center; Yang, C., Wang, J., A mathematical model for the novel coronavirus epidemic in Wuhan (2020) China.

The model fitting with result analysis is performed by utilizing COVID-19 data from 25 January 2020 to 22 February 2020. And then the fitted model is used to simulate the evolution after February 22, 2020. The results show that the introduction of 'undiscovered people' has a significant improvement in fitting and prediction performance, reducing the fitting error by 50% to 70%. The fitting coefficient shows that the virus-laden population accounted for 30% and 5% of exposed people, respectively, in the early and late stages of epidemic. The diagnosed probability of virus-laden population has increased from 7% to 40%, which shows that nucleic acid detection technology is becoming matured. Initial number of undiscovered people is about 70 000, and under effective national control, it is currently controlled at about 2 500. It is predicted that the ""inflection point"" will be mid-March, then residents can return to normal life at the end of April, and the cumulative diagnosis is about 100 000 finally. © 2020, Editorial Board of Journal of the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China.

In order to understand the origins of both approaches as mean-field approximations of integer and fractional stochastic processes, we introduce the fractional differential equations (FDEs) as approximations of some type of fractional nonlinear birth and death processes. Then, we examine validity of the two approaches against empirical courses of epidemics; we fit both of them to case counts of three measles epidemics that occurred during the pre-vaccination era in three different locations. While ordinary differential equations (ODEs) are commonly used to model epidemics, FDEs are more flexible in fitting empirical data and theoretically offer improved model predictions. The question arises whether, in practice, the benefits of using FDEs over ODEs outweigh the added computational complexities. While important differences in transient dynamics were observed, the FDE only outperformed the ODE in one of out three data sets. In general, FDE modeling approaches may be worth it in situations with large refined data sets and good numerical algorithms. © 2020 by the authors.

The 2009 A/H1N1 outbreak in the UK revealed pandemic data as noisy, contaminated, potentially biased and originating from multiple sources. This seriously challenges the capacity for real-time monitoring. Here, we assess the feasibility of real-time inference based on such data by constructing an analytic tool combining an age-stratified SEIR transmission model with various observa-tion models describing the data generation mechanisms. As batches of data become available, a sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) algorithm is developed to synthesise multiple imperfect data streams, iterate epidemic inferences and assess model adequacy amidst a rapidly evolving epidemic environment, substantially reducing computation time in comparison to standard MCMC, to ensure timely delivery of real-time epidemic assessments. In application to simulated data designed to mimic the 2009 A/H1N1 epidemic, SMC is shown to have additional benefits in terms of assessing predictive performance and coping with parameter nonidentifiability. © Institute of Mathematical Statistics, 2020.","Pandemic influenza; Real-time inference; Resample-move; SEIR transmission model; Sequential Monte Carlo",,"Ahrens, H., Multivariate variance-covariance components (MVCC) and generalized intraclass correlation coefficient (GICC) (1976) Biom.

These models were originally developed in different scientific communities, and their commonalities are under-explored. This work establishes, for the first time, a general connection between the two model classes via three new mathematical components. The first is a generalized version of stochastic Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model with arbitrary recovery time distributions; the second is the relationship between the (latent and arbitrary) recovery time distribution, recovery hazard function, and the infection kernel of self-exciting processes; the third includes methods for simulating, fitting, evaluating and predicting the generalized process. On three large Twitter diffusion datasets, we conduct goodness-of-fit tests and holdout log-likelihood evaluation of self-exciting processes with three infection kernels — exponential, power-law and Tsallis Q-exponential. We show that the modeling performance of the infection kernels varies with respect to the temporal structures of diffusions, and also with respect to user behavior, such as the likelihood of being bots. We further improve the prediction of popularity by combining two models that are identified as complementary by the goodness-of-fit tests. © 2020 Association for Computing Machinery.","Epidemic models; Hawkes processes; Information diffusion","Behavioral research; Data mining; Epidemiology; Information retrieval; Large dataset; Recovery; Stochastic systems; Websites; Diffusion phenomena; Epidemic models; Goodness-of-fit test; Information diffusion; Model informations; Scientific community; Susceptible-infected-recovered model; Temporal structures; Stochastic models","Allen, L.J.S., An introduction to stochastic epidemic models (2008) Mathematical Epidemiology, , Springer, Chapter 3; Bacry, E., Mastromatteo, I., Muzy, J.-F., Hawkes processes in finance (2015) Market Microstructure and Liquidity, , 2015; Bartlett, M.S., Some evolutionary stochastic processes (1949) Journal of the Royal Statistical Society.

Materials and Methods A SIR model with a deterministic approach was used to forecast the development of the COVID-19 pandemic in Colombia. The states considered were susceptible (S), infectious (i) and recovered or deceased (R). Population data were obtained from the National Administrative Department of Statistics (DANE) - Population Projections 2018-2020, released in January 2020-, and data on daily confirmed cases of COVID-19 from the National Institute of Health. Different models were proposed varying the basic reproduction number (R0). Results Based on the cases reported by the Ministry of Health, 4 simulated environments were created in an epidemiological SIR model. The time series was extended until May 30, the probable date when 99% of the population will be infected. R0=2 is the basic reproduction number and the closest approximation to the behavior of the pandemic during the first 15 days since the first case report; the worst scenario would occur in the first week of April with R0=3. Conclusions Further mitigation and suppression measures are necessary in the containment and sustained transmission phases, such as increased diagnostic capacity through testing and disinfection of populated areas and homes in isolation. © 2020, Universidad Nacional de Colombia.

A variety of theoretical models have been presented by many authors. Examples are SIR, SIS, SIRS models. By the use of these models, both effects of prevention and quarantine have been explored for the suppression of disease. Here, the term “prevention” denotes that the susceptible person behaves not to be infected; examples are vaccination and preventable behaviors. In contrast, we use the term “quarantine” as the decrease of infection opportunity; if people avoid the interactions, the infection will be reduced. In the present paper, we study the SIS model on a square lattice: It is called “contact process” or “lattice logistic model.” The contact process has been extensively investigated by many fields, such as mathematics, physics and ecology. Each lattice site takes one of three states: susceptible (S), infected (I) and prevention (P) sites. Infection is assumed to occur between S and I at adjacent sites: no infection occurs for P. To explore both effects of prevention and quarantine, we apply the site and bond percolations respectively. Computer simulations reveal that the system evolves into an equilibrium state. When the infection rate ß increases, or when the recovering rate ? decreases, then the equilibrium density of I increases. The final equilibrium state becomes either infectious or disease-free phase. The boundary between both phases can be represented by a scaling law. The mean-field theory well predicts such infection dynamics and the scaling law. However, the theory never predicts the following “percolation thresholds”: When both levels of prevention and quarantine exceed a threshold (percolation threshold), the disease is effectively suppressed irrespective of the values of ß and ?. The percolation means the spatial connection of protected people which cooperatively prohibits the infection. © MODSIM 2009.All rights reserved.","Percolation threshold; Prevention; Quarantine; Scaling law; SIS model","Computation theory; Crystal lattices; Mean field theory; Percolation (computer storage); Percolation (fluids); Percolation (solid state); Solvents; Bond percolation; Contact process; Epidemic disease; Equilibrium density; Equilibrium state; Infection dynamics; Percolation thresholds; Temporal dynamics; Disease control","Harris, T.E., Contact interaction on a lattice (1974) Ann.

However, they can be imprecise due to various uncertainties. Deterministic epidemic models are also subjected to stochastic perturbations. In this paper, we analyze a stochastic SIRS model that includes interval parameters and environmental noises. We define the stochastic basic reproduction number, which is shown to govern disease extinction or persistence. When it is less than one, the disease is predicted to die out with probability one. When it is greater than one, the model admits a stationary distribution. Thus, larger stochastic noises (resulting in a smaller stochastic basic reproduction number) are able to suppress the emergence of disease outbreaks. Using numerical simulations, we also investigate the influence of parameter imprecision and susceptible response to the disease information that may change individual behavior and protect the susceptible from infection. These parameters can greatly affect the long-term behavior of the system, highlighting the importance of incorporating parameter imprecision into epidemic models and the role of information intervention in the control of infectious diseases. © 2019 American Institute of Mathematical Sciences.

The model without linear recruitment was proposed and studied by Allen et al. (SIAM J Appl Math 67(5):1283–1309, 2007). This model possesses a conserved total population number, whereas the model with linear recruitment has a varying total population. However, both models have the same basic reproduction number. For both models, we establish the global stability of endemic equilibrium in a special case, which partially solves an open problem. Then we investigate the asymptotic behavior of endemic equilibrium as the mobility of infected and/or susceptible population tends to zero. Though the basic reproduction number is a well-known critical index, our theoretical results strongly suggest that other factors such as the variation of total population number and individual movement may also play vital roles in disease prediction and control. In particular, our results imply that the variation of total population number can cause infectious disease to become more threatening and difficult to control. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Asymptotic profile; Basic reproduction number; Disease-free equilibrium; Endemic equilibrium; Global dynamics; SIS epidemic patch model",,"Allen, L.J.S., Bolker, B.M., Lou, Y., Nevai, A.L., Asymptotic profiles of the steady states for an SIS epidemic patch model (2007) SIAM J Appl Math, 67 (5), pp. 1283-1309; Allen, L.J.S., Bolker, B.M., Lou, Y., Nevai, A.L., Asymptotic profiles of the steady states for an SIS epidemic reaction–diffusion model (2008) Discrete Contin Dyn Syst, 21, pp. 1-20; Allen, L.J.S., Bolker, B.M., Lou, Y., Nevai, A.L., Spatial patterns in a discrete-time SIS patch model (2009) J Math Biol, 58, pp. 339-375; Anderson, R.M., May, R.M., Population biology of infectious diseases (1979) Nature, 280, pp. 361-367; Anderson, R.M., May, R.M., (1991) Infectious diseases of humans: dynamics and control, , Oxford University Press, Oxford; Arino, J., Diseases in metapopulations (2009) Modeling and Dynamics of Infectious Diseases, Ser.

We first solve the SIR model analytically for two symmetric cooperative contagions [L. Chen, Europhys. Lett. 104, 50001 (2013)10.1209/0295-5075/104/50001] and then generalize and solve the model exactly in the symmetric scenarios for three and more cooperative contagions. We calculate the transition points and order parameters, i.e., the total number of infected hosts. We show that the behavior of the system does not change qualitatively with the inclusion of more diseases. We also show analytically that there is a saddle-node-like bifurcation for two cooperative SIR dynamics and that the transition is hybrid. Moreover, we investigate where the symmetric solution is stable for initial fluctuations. We finally explore sets of parameters which give rise to asymmetric cases, namely, the asymmetric cases of primary and secondary infection rates of one pathogen with respect to another. This setting can lead to fewer infected hosts, a higher epidemic threshold, and also continuous transitions. These results open the road to a better understanding of disease ecology. © 2019 American Physical Society.",,"Dynamics; Continuous transitions; Disease ecology; Epidemic threshold; Exact solution; Infection rates; Order parameter; Symmetric solution; Transition point; Dynamic models","Hays, J.N., (2005) Epidemics and Pandemics: Their Impacts on Human History, , (ABC-CLIO, Santa Barbara, CA); Faure, E., Malarial pathocoenosis: Beneficial and deleterious interactions between malaria and other human diseases (2014) Front.

Yet during real-world outbreaks, individuals may modify their behavior and take preventative steps to reduce infection risk. As a consequence, the relationship between the initial rate of spread and the final case count may become tenuous. Here, we evaluate this hypothesis by comparing the dynamics arising from a simple SIR epidemic model with those from a modified SIR model in which individuals reduce contacts as a function of the current or cumulative number of cases. Dynamics with behavior change exhibit significantly reduced final case counts even though the initial speed of disease spread is nearly identical for both of the models. We show that this difference in final size projections depends critically in the behavior change of individuals. These results also provide a rationale for integrating behavior change into iterative forecast models. Hence, we propose to use a Kalman filter to update models with and without behavior change as part of iterative forecasts. When the ground truth outbreak includes behavior change, sequential predictions using a simple SIR model perform poorly despite repeated observations while predictions using the modified SIR model are able to correct for initial forecast errors. These findings highlight the value of incorporating behavior change into baseline epidemic and dynamic forecast models. © 2019 The Authors","Disease forecasting; Epidemiology; Nonlinear dynamics; Social distancing","Article; basic reproduction number; behavior change; forecasting; human; infection; infection rate; infection risk; nonlinear system; priority journal; statistical bias","Ajelli, M., Merler, S., Fumanelli, L., y Piontti, A.P., Dean, N.E., Longini, I.M., Spatiotemporal dynamics of the Ebola epidemic in Guinea and implications for vaccination and disease elimination: a computational modeling analysis (2016) BMC Med., 14 (1), p. 130; Ajelli, M., Zhang, Q., Sun, K., Merler, S., Fumanelli, L., Chowell, G., The RAPIDD Ebola forecasting challenge: model description and synthetic data generation (2017) Epidemics; Anderson, R.M., May, R.M., Anderson, B., Infectious Diseases of Humans: Dynamics and Control, vol. 28 (1992), Oxford University Press; Anderson, J.L., An ensemble adjustment Kalman filter for data assimilation (2001) Mon.

During certain periods of the year incidence rates of a number of endemic infectious diseases may fluctuate dramatically. This influences the dynamics of mathematical models describing the spread of infection and often leads to chaotic oscillations. In this paper, we are concerned with a generalization of a classical Susceptible–Infected–Recovered epidemic model which accounts for seasonal effects. Combining numerical and analytic techniques, we gain new insights into the complex dynamics of a recurrent disease influenced by the seasonality. Computation of the Lyapunov spectrum allows us to identify different chaotic regimes, determine the fractal dimension and estimate the predictability of the appearance of attractors in the system. Applying the homotopy analysis method, we obtain series solutions to the original nonautonomous SIR model with a high level of accuracy and use these approximations to analyze the dynamics of the system. The efficiency of the method is guaranteed by the optimal choice of an auxiliary control parameter which ensures the rapid convergence of the series to the exact solution of the forced SIR epidemic model. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Chaotic behavior; Explicit solutions; Seasonal fluctuations; SIR epidemic model",,"Abbasbandy, S., Solution for the FitzHugh–Nagumo equation with the homotopy analysis method (2008) Appl Math Model, 32, pp. 2706-2714; Alomari, A.K., Noorani, M.S.M., Nazar, R.R., Li, C.P., Homotopy analysis method for solving fractional Lorenz system (2010) Commun Nonlinear Sci Numer Simul, 15, pp. 1864-1872; Altizer, S., Dobson, A., Hosseini, P., Hudson, P., Pascual, M., Rohani, P., Seasonality and the dynamics of infectious diseases (2006) Ecol Lett, 9, pp. 467-484; Aron, J.L., Schwartz, I.B., Seasonality and period-doubling bifurcations in an epidemic model (1984) J Theor Biol, 110, pp. 665-679; Aron, J.L., Schwartz, I.B., Multiple recurrent outbreaks and predictability in seasonally forced nonlinear epidemic models (1984) J Theor Biol, 21, pp. 347-361; Axelsen, J.B., Yaari, R., Grenfell, B.T., Stone, L., Multiannual forecasting of seasonal influenza dynamics reveals climatic and evolutionary drivers (2014) Proc Natl Acad Sci, 111, pp. 9538-9542; Bai-Lin, H., Wei-Mou, Z., Applied symbolic dynamics and chaos (1998) Directions in Chaos 7, pp. 1-460. , World Scientific Publishing Co, Singapore; Barrientos, P.G., Rodríguez, J.Á., Ruiz-Herrera, A., Chaotic dynamics in the seasonally forced SIR epidemic model (2017) J Math Biol, 75, pp. 1655-1668; Bataineh, A.S., Noorani, M.S.M., Hashim, I., Solving systems of ODEs by homotopy analysis method (2008) Commun Nonlinear Sci Numer Simul, 13, pp. 2060-2070; Bernoulli, D., Essai d’une nouvelle analyse de la mortalité causée par la petite vérole, et des avantages de l’inoculation pour la prévenir (1766) Mem Math Phys Acad Roy Sci, Paris, pp. 1-45; Billings, L., Schwartz, I.B., Exiting chaos with noise: unexpected dynamics in epidemic outbreaks (2002) J Math Biol, 44, pp. 31-48; Buonuomo, B., Chitnis, N., d’Onofrio, A., Seasonality in epidemic models: a literature review (2018) Ricerche Mat, 67, pp. 7-25; Chua, L.O., Komuro, M., Matsumoto, T., The double scroll family: Rigorous proof of chaos (1986) IEEE Trans Circuits Syst, 33, pp. 1072-1097; Diedrichs, D.R., Isihara, P.A., Buursma, D.D., The schedule effect: can recurrent peak infectious be reduced without vaccines, quarantines or school closings?

We prove that the stochastic model has a non-negative solution that belongs to a positively invariant set. By applying a novel combination of suitable Lyapunov functions, we obtain that the asymptotic behaviour of the stochastic model holds a disease-free equilibrium if R0≤1 and investigate pth-moment exponential stability. Then we derive the sufficient conditions for the solution of the stochastic model that fluctuates around the endemic equilibrium if R0&gt;1. Furthermore, the suitable conditions for the extinction and persistence of the diseases are established due to intensities of white noise in large.

It exhibits simple dynamics: a bifurcation parameter T0 yielding persistence of the disease when T0 &gt; 1, else extinction occurs. A natural question is whether this gentle dynamic can be disturbed by spatial diffusion. It is straightforward to check it is not feasible for linear/nonlinear diffusions. When cross diffusion is introduced for suitable choices of the parameter data set this persistent state of the ODE model system becomes linearly unstable for the resulting initial and no-flux boundary value problem. On the other hand “natural” weak solutions can be defined for this initial and no-flux boundary value problem and proved to exist provided nonlinear and cross diffusivities satisfy some constraints. These constraints are not fully met for the parameter data set yielding instability. A remaining open question is: to which solutions does this apply?

Simultaneously, the impact of the time-varying heterogeneity of host susceptibility on the short-term behavior of epidemics is not well-studied despite the availability of a large amount of epidemiological data on short-term epidemics. This paper proposes a parsimonious mathematical model describing the short-term transmission dynamics by taking into account waning and enhancing susceptibility following the infection. In addition to the common classification in the standard SIR model, i.e., “no epidemic” as R0 ≤ 1 or normal epidemic as R0 &gt; 1, the proposed model also shows the “delayed epidemic” class when an epidemic takes off after the negative slope of the epidemic curve at the initial phase of the epidemic. The condition for each of the three classes is derived based on the obtained explicit solution for the proposed model. © 2019 the Author(s), licensee AIMS Press.","Boosting of immunity; Epidemic model; Final epidemic size; Short-term disease transmission dynamics","Dynamics; Transmissions; Boosting of immunity; Disease transmission; Epidemic modeling; Final epidemic size; Host susceptibility; Long-term behavior; Short-term behavior; Transmission dynamics; Epidemiology; algorithm; biological model; communicable disease; disease predisposition; epidemic; human; immune system; immunity; infectious disease medicine; procedures; public health; time factor; Algorithms; Communicable Diseases; Disease Outbreaks; Disease Susceptibility; Epidemics; Humans; Immune System; Immunity; Infectious Disease Medicine; Models, Biological; Public Health; Time Factors","Anderson, R.M., May, R.M., (1992) Infectious Diseases of Humans: Dynamics and Control, 28. , Oxford: Oxford University Press; Arino, J., McCluskey, C.C., Van Den Driessche, P., Global results for an epidemic model with vaccination that exhibits backward bifurcation (2003) SIAM J.

The infected compartments are divided into two classes namely; symptomatic infected and asymptomatic infected individuals in order to observe the contribution of vibrio cholerae to the environment from each compartment. The main objective of this paper is to validate the model using Ilala† municipal council data. We estimate the model parameters using least square and Bayesian approach via Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. The sample of 10,000 number of simulations was carried out in MCMC run to study the behaviour of each parameter in the proposed model. The results show that the parameters have good convergence, the dynamic behaviour of prediction fits the observed data. © 2019 the authors.","Adaptive Markov chain Monte Carlo; Bayesian; Cholera epidemic; Least square method; Markov chain Monte Carlo",,"Edward, S., Nyerere, N., A mathematical model for the dynamics of cholera with control measures (2015) Appl.

Mathematical models are invaluable tools in understanding and describing disease dynamics with preventive measures for controlling the disease. The roles of media coverage and behavioral changes due to externally imposed factors on the disease dynamics are well studied. However, the effect of self-imposed psychological fear on the disease transmission has not been considered in extant research, and this gap is addressed in the present investigation. We propose a simple SI-type model for HIV/AIDS to assess the effects of media and self-imposed psychological fear on the disease dynamics. Local and global dynamics of the system are studied. Global sensitivity analysis is performed to identify the most influential parameters that have significant impact on the basic reproduction number. After calibrating our model using HIV case data-sets for Uganda and Tanzania, we calculate the basic reproduction numbers in the study period using the estimated parameters. Furthermore, a comparison of the effects of awareness and self-imposed psychological fear effects reveals that awareness is more effective in eliminating the burden of HIV infection. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Awareness; Epidemic model; Global sensitivity analysis; HIV/AIDS; Parameter estimation; Self-imposed psychological fear; Stability analysis","Disease control; Dynamics; Parameter estimation; Sensitivity analysis; Awareness; Epidemic modeling; Global sensitivity analysis; HIV/AIDS; Self-imposed psychological fear; Stability analysis; Diseases; antiretrovirus agent; acquired immune deficiency syndrome; disease control; disease transmission; epidemic; human immunodeficiency virus; numerical model; parameter estimation; psychology; sensitivity analysis; access to information; acquired immune deficiency syndrome; antiretroviral therapy; Article; asymptomatic disease; awareness; behavior change; calibration; disease free survival; disease transmission; epidemic; fear; feasibility study; health care delivery; health program; health promotion; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; incidence; infection prevention; infection sensitivity; information dissemination; mass medium; motivation; pathogen clearance; pathogen load; prevalence; public health; self imposed psychological fear; simulation; statistical analysis; statistical model; Tanzania; Uganda; attitude to health; basic reproduction number; health behavior; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; mass medium; mathematical phenomena; nonlinear system; psychological model; psychology; transmission; Tanzania; Uganda; Awareness; Basic Reproduction Number; Fear; Health Behavior; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; HIV Infections; Humans; Mass Media; Mathematical Concepts; Models, Psychological; Nonlinear Dynamics; Tanzania; Uganda","World health Organization, (2005), preventing chronic diseases: a vital investment; Hatchett, R.J., Mecher, C.E., Lipsitch, M., Public health interventions and epidemic intensity during the 1918 influenza pandemic (2007) Proc.

The mean Latin hypercube finite difference (MLHFD) method is proposed for the first time via hybrid integration of the classical numerical finite difference (FD) formula with Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) technique to create a random distribution for the model parameters which are dependent on time t. The LHS technique gives advantage to MLHFD method to produce fast variation of the parameters' values via number of multidimensional simulations (100, 1000 and 5000). The generated Latin hypercube sample which is random or non-deterministic in nature is further integrated with the FD method to complete one cycle of LHS-FD simulation iteration. This process is repeated until n final iterations of LHS-FD are obtained. The means of these n final solutions (MLHFD solutions) are tabulated, graphed and analyzed. The numerical simulation results of MLHFD for the SEIR model are presented side-by-side with deterministic solutions obtained from the classical FD scheme and homotopy analysis method with Pade approximation (HAM-Pade). The present MLHFD results are also compared with the previous non-deterministic statistical estimations from 1995 to 2015. Good agreement between the two is perceived with small errors. MLHFD method can be used to predict future behavior, range and prediction interval for the epidemic model solutions. The expected profiles of the cocaine abuse subpopulations are projected until the year 2045. Both the statistical estimations and the deterministic results of FD and HAM-Pade are found to be within the MLHFD prediction intervals for all the years and for all the subpopulations considered. © 2018 World Scientific Publishing Company.","Epidemic model; finite difference method; Latin hypercube sampling; ordinary differential equation; prediction interval; random distribution; SEIR",,"Bai, Z., Threshold dynamics of A time-delayed SEIRS model with pulse vaccination (2015) Mathematical Biosciences, 269, pp. 178-185; Budgaga, W., Malensek, M., Pallickara, S., Harvey, N., Breidt, F.J., Pallickara, S., Predictive analytics using statistical, learning, and ensemble methods to support realtime exploration of discrete event simulations (2016) Future Generation Computer Systems, 56, pp. 360-374; Dagpunar, J.S., (2007) Simulation and Monte Carlo: With Applications in Finance and MCMC, , John Wiley & Sons Ltd, England; De La Sen, M., Alonso-Quesada, S., Ibeas, A., On the stability of an SEIR epidemic model with distributed time-delay and A general class of feedback vaccination rules (2015) Applied Mathematics and Computation, 270, pp. 953-976; Diekmann, O., Heesterbeek, J.A.P., (2008) Mathematical Epidemiology of Infectious Diseases: Model Building Analysis and Interpretation, , Springer-Verlag, Berlin, Heidelberg; Ferziger, J.H., Peric, M., Leonard, A., (2002) Computational Methods for Fluid Dynamics, , 3rd edn.

It is assumed that only sets of admissible values are known for the model's disturbances, uncertainties and parameters, except for the time-varying transmission rate from the 'susceptible' to the 'exposed' stage, whose bounding values are unavailable. An interval observer is designed to estimate the set of possible values of the state, and a sufficient condition guaranteeing the asymptotic stability of the proposed estimator is formulated in terms of a linear matrix inequality. The performance of the proposed approach is demonstrated by numerical simulations. © 2018 AACC.",,,"Vaillant, L., La Ruche, G., Tarantola, A., Barboza, P., Epidemiology of fatal cases associated with pandemic H1N1 influenza 2009 (2009) Eurosurveillance, 14 (33), pp. 1-6. , August; Fallas-Monge, J.J., Chavarría-Molina, J., Alpízar-Brenes, G., Combinatorial metaheuristics applied to infectious disease models (2016) Proc. of the 2016 IEEE 36th Central American and Panama Convention (CONCAPAN XXXVI), , November; Dukic, V., Lopes, H.F., Polson, N.G., Tracking epidemics with google flu trends data and a state-space SEIR model (2012) Journal of the American Statistical Association, 107 (500), pp. 1410-1426; Keeling, M.J., (2008) Modeling Infectious Diseases in Humans and Animals, , Princeton and Oxford: Princeton University Press; Grassly, N.C., Fraser, C., Mathematical models of infectious disease transmission (2008) Nature Reviews Microbiology, 6, pp. 477-487. , June; Kaplan, E.H., Craft, D.L., Wein, L.M., Emergency response to a smallpox attack: The case for mass vaccination (2002) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 99 (16), pp. 10935-10940. , August; Kermack, W.O., McKendrick, A.G., A contribution to the mathematical theory of epidemics (1927) Proc. of the Royal Society of London A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences, 115 (772), pp. 700-721; Hethcote, H.W., The mathematics of infectious diseases (2000) SIAM Review, 42 (4), pp. 599-653; Ibeas, A., De La Sen, M., Alonso-Quesada, S., Zamani, I., Shafiee, M., Observer design for seir discrete-time epidemic models (2014) Proc. of the 2014 13th International Conference on Control Automation Robotics Vision (ICARCV), pp. 1321-1326. , December; Alonso-Quesada, S., De La Sen, M., Agarwal, R., Ibeas, A., An observer-based vaccination control law for an SEIR epidemic model based on feedback linearization techniques for nonlinear systems (2012) Advances in Difference Equations, 2012 (1), p. 161. , September; Efimov, D., Raïssi, T., Zolghadri, A., Control of nonlinear and LPV systems: Interval observer-based framework (2013) IEEE Trans.

Further, a comparative study of the equilibrium points of the disease for the classical and fuzzy models are performed. We study the fuzzy basic reproduction number for groups of infected individuals with different virus loads and compare with a basic reproduction number for the classical model.

Some infectious diseases, including influenza, hand, foot and mouth disease, dengue and meningitis, are temporally limited by variations in the meteorological factors, such as sunshine, temperature, humidity, rainfall, atmospheric pressure, wind speed and so on. Therefore, it is necessary to predict the behavior of outbreak of these infectious diseases based on meteorological factors. Objective: Review various epidemic models related to meteorological factors. Results: We discuss two kinds of epidemic models: deterministic models and stochastic models. The deterministic models include switched SIR model, seasonal SIR model, periodic SEIR system and seasonal SEIQR model. And the stochastic models involve multiple regression models, auto-regressive moving average model, autoregressive distributed lag model, time series Poisson regression models and generalized additive models. Furthermore, we introduce the latest applications of these models, respectively. Conclusion: In our work, these deterministic models and stochastic models can successfully predict the diseases outbreak using meteorological factors, and they all are now widely used in the field. However, few meteorological factors are used in these models. With the development of Meteorological Science, large amounts of Meteorological factor data will be obtained. More key Meteorological factors causing an epidemic will be identified. Therefore, in the future, more key meteorological factors will be considered in models and they will further improve the accuracy of the forecast. © 2018 Bentham Science Publishers.","Deterministic models;

Our goal is to acquaint the reader with applications of PGFs, moreso than to derive new results. PGFs help predict a number of properties about early outbreak behavior while the population is still effectively infinite, including the probability of an epidemic, the size distribution after some number of generations, and the cumulative size distribution of non-epidemic outbreaks. We show how PGFs can be used in both discrete-time and continuous-time settings, and discuss how to use these results to infer disease parameters from observed outbreaks. In the large population limit for susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) epidemics PGFs lead to survival-function based models that are equivalent to the usual mass-action SIR models but with fewer ODEs. We use these to explore properties such as the final size of epidemics or even the dynamics once stochastic effects are negligible. We target this primer at biologists and public health researchers with mathematical modeling experience who want to learn how to apply PGFs to invasive diseases, but it could also be used in an applications-based mathematics course on PGFs.

We recently introduced a single equation model (the incidence decay with exponential adjustment, or IDEA model) that can be used for short-term epidemiological forecasting. In the mid-19th century, Dr. William Farr made the observation that epidemic events rise and fall in a roughly symmetrical pattern that can be approximated by a bell-shaped curve. He noticed that this time-evolution behavior could be captured by a single mathematical formula (“Farr's law”) that could be used for epidemic forecasting. We show here that the IDEA model follows Farr's law, and show that for intuitive assumptions, Farr's Law can be derived from the IDEA model. Moreover, we show that both mathematical approaches, Farr's Law and the IDEA model, resemble solutions of a susceptible-infectious-removed (SIR) compartmental differential-equation model in an asymptotic limit, where the changes of disease transmission respond to control measures, and not only to the depletion of susceptible individuals. This suggests that the concept of the reproduction number (R0) was implicitly captured in Farr's (pre-microbial era) work, and also suggests that control of epidemics, whether via behavior change or intervention, is as integral to the natural history of epidemics as is the dynamics of disease transmission. © 2018",,"Article; Chikungunya virus; disease transmission; Ebolavirus; epidemic; epidemiological monitoring; incidence; incidence decay with exponential adjustment model; infection control; mathematical model; seasonal variation; simulation; susceptible infectious removed compartmental difference equation model","Armstrong, G.L., Conn, L.A., Pinner, R.W., Trends in infectious disease mortality in the United States during the 20th century (1999) Journal of the American Medical Association, 281, pp. 61-66; Azhar, E.I., Evidence for camel-to-human transmission of MERS coronavirus (2014) New England Journal of Medicine, 370, pp. 2499-2505; Baize, S., Pannetier, D., Oestereich, L., Emergence of Zaire ebola virus disease in Guinea (2014) New England Journal of Medicine, 371, pp. 1418-1425; Brownlee, J., Historical note on Farr's theory of the epidemic (1915) British Medical Journal, 2, pp. 250-252; Brownlee, J., Studies in the meaning and relationships of birth and death rates II: Density of population and death rate (Farr's law) (1915) The Journal of Hygiene, 15, pp. 11-16; Brownlee, J., On the curve of the epidemic (1915) British Medical Journal, 2, pp. 799-800; Cowling, B.J., Comparative epidemiology of human infections with avian influenza A H7N9 and H5N1 viruses in China: A population-based study of laboratory-confirmed cases (2013) Lancet—, 382, pp. 129-137; Evans, G.H., (1876) Some arithmetical considerations on the progress of epidemics, 3, pp. 551-555. , Transactions of the Epidemiological Society of London, Sessions 1866-1876 Hardwicke and Bogue London; Ewald, P., Evolution of virulence (2004) Infectious Disease Clinics of North America, 18, pp. 1-15; Farr, W., Appendix to the second annual report of the registrar-general (1840), http://histpop.org/ohpr/servlet/PageBrowser2?ResourceType=Registrar, UK.

A threshold dynamic determined by the basic reproduction number R0 is established: the disease can be eradicated almost surely if R0&lt;1, while the disease persists almost surely if R0&gt;1. The existing method for analyzing ergodic behavior of population systems has been generalized. The modified method weakens the required conditions and has no limitations for both the number of environmental regimes and the dimension of the considered system. When R0&gt;1, the existence of a stationary probability measure is obtained. Furthermore, with the modified method, the global attractivity of the Ω-limit set of the system and the convergence in total variation to the stationary measure are both demonstrated under a mild extra condition. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Attractor; Markov switching; Piecewise deterministic Markov process; Stationary distribution; Stochastic SIRS epidemic model; Ω-limit set",,"Kermack, W.O., McKendrick, A.G., A contribution to the mathematical theory of epidemics (1927) Proc.

Here we established a modified SIR model with nonlinear incidence and recovery rates, to understand the influence by any government intervention and hospitalization condition variation in the spread of diseases. By analyzing the existence and stability of the equilibria, we found that the basic reproduction number R0 is not a threshold parameter, and our model undergoes backward bifurcation when there is limited number of hospital beds. When the saturated coefficient a is set to zero, it is discovered that the model undergoes the Saddle-Node bifurcation, Hopf bifurcation, and Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation of codimension 2. The bifurcation diagram can further be drawn near the cusp type of the Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation of codimension 3 by numerical simulation. We also found a critical value of the hospital beds bc at R0 1 and sufficiently small a, which suggests that the disease can be eliminated at the hospitals where the number of beds is larger than bc. The same dynamic behaviors exist even when a 6. 0. Therefore, it can be concluded that a sufficient number of the beds is critical to control the epidemic. © 2017 Li, Zhang.This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.",,"Article; calculation; compartment model; disease control; disease transmission; dynamics; epidemic; hospital bed capacity; hospitalization; incidence; mathematical computing; mathematical variable; nonlinear system; simulation; statistical concepts; communicable disease; human; incidence; theoretical model; Communicable Diseases; Humans; Incidence; Models, Theoretical","Brauer, F., Castillo-Chavez, C., (2001) Mathematical Models in Population Biology and Epidemiology [M], , New York: Springer; Kermack, W.O., McKendrick, A.G., A contribution to the mathematical theory of epidemics[C] (1927) Proceedings of the Royal Society of London A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences, 115 (772), pp. 700-721. , The Royal Society; Hethcote, H.W., The mathematics of infectious diseases[J] (2000) SIAM Review, 42 (4), pp. 599-653. , https://doi.org/10.1137/S0036144500371907; Gumel, A.B., Ruan, S., Day, T., Modelling strategies for controlling SARS outbreaks[J] (2004) Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences, 271 (1554), pp. 2223-2232. , https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2004.2800; Li, L., Monthly periodic outbreak of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in China[J] (2016) Journal of Biological Systems, 24, pp. 519-533. , https://doi.org/10.1142/S0218339016500261; Li, L., Patch invasion in a spatial epidemic model[J] (2015) Applied Mathematics and Computation, 258, pp. 342-349. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amc.2015.02.006; Gui-Quan, S., Transmission dynamics of cholera: Mathematical modeling and control strategies [J] (2017) Commun.

The limiting behavior of the model and approximation are qualitatively different in the subcritical case, requiring a novel analysis of the limiting behavior of the Hamiltonian system away from its deterministic subsystem. This yields a novel, general technique of approximation of the quasistationary distribution of stochastic epidemic and birth-death models and may lead to techniques for analysis of these models beyond the quasistationary distribution. For a classic SIS model, the approximation found for the quasistationary distribution is very similar to published approximations but not identical. For a birth-death process without depletion of susceptibles, the approximation is exact. Dynamics on the phase plane similar to those predicted by the Hamiltonian analysis are demonstrated in cross-sectional data from trachoma treatment trials in Ethiopia, in which declining prevalences are consistent with subcritical epidemic dynamics. © 2017 Lee Worden et al.",,"Article; basic reproduction number; birth; epidemic; Hamiltonian analysis; human; mathematical model; population dynamics; population size; stochastic model; trachoma; cross-sectional study; disease predisposition; Ethiopia; Markov chain; theoretical model; trachoma; Cross-Sectional Studies; Disease Susceptibility; Epidemics; Ethiopia; Humans; Models, Theoretical; Stochastic Processes; Trachoma","Bailey, N.T.J., (1975) The Mathematical Theory of Infectious Diseases, , Griffin, London, UK; Nasell, I., The quasi-stationary distribution of the closed endemic SISmodel (1996) Advances in Applied Probability, 28 (3), pp. 895-932. , http://www.jstor.org/stable/1428186; Lambert, A., Population dynamics and random genealogies (2008) Stochastic Models, 24 (1), pp. 45-163; Lietman, T.M., Gebre, T., Ayele, B., The epidemiological dynamics of infectious trachoma may facilitate elimination (2011) Epidemics, 3 (2), pp. 119-124; Lietman, T.M., Gebre, T., Abdou, A., The distribution of the prevalence of ocular chlamydial infection in communities where trachoma is disappearing (2015) Epidemics, 11, pp. 85-91; Rahman, S.A., West, S.K., Mkocha, H., The distribution of ocular Chlamydia prevalence across Tanzanian communities where trachoma is declining (2015) PLoSNeglected Tropical Diseases, 9 (3); Cavender, J.A., Quasi-stationary distributions of birth-anddeath processes (1978) Advances in Applied Probability, 10 (3), pp. 570-586; Kryscio, R.J., Lefèvre, C., On the extinction of the SIS Stochastic logistic epidemic (1989) Journal of Applied Probability, 26 (4), pp. 685-694; Nasell, I., Moment closure and the stochastic logistic model (2003) Theoretical Population Biology, 63 (2), pp. 159-168; Barbour, A.D., Pollett, P.K., Total variation approximation for quasi-stationary distributions (2010) Journal of Applied Probability, 47 (4), pp. 934-946; Van Doorn, E.A., Pollett, P.K., Quasi-stationary distributions for discrete-statemodels (2013) European Journal OfOperational Research, 230 (1), pp. 1-14; Artalejo, J.R., Lopez-Herrero, M.J., Quasi-stationary and ratio of expectations distributions: A comparative study (2010) Journal of Theoretical Biology, 266 (2), pp. 264-274. , http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022519310003206; Méleárd, S., Villemonais, D., Quasi-stationary distributions and population processes (2012) Probability Surveys, 9, pp. 340-410; Dykman, M.I., Schwartz, I.B., Landsman, A.S., Disease extinction in the presence of random vaccination (2008) Physical Review Letters, 101 (7); Ovaskainen, O., Meerson, B., Stochastic models of population extinction (2010) Trends in Ecology & Evolution, 25 (11), pp. 643-652. , http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0169534710001801; Schwartz, I.B., Forgoston, E., Bianco, S., Shaw, L.B., Converging towards the optimal path to extinction (2011) Journal of the Royal Society Interface, 8 (65), pp. 1699-1707. , http://rsif.royalsocietypublishing.org/cgi/doi/10.1098/rsif.2011.0159; Graham, R., Tél, T., On the weak-noise limit of Fokker-Planck models (1984) Journal of Statistical Physics, 35 (5-6), pp. 729-748. , http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01010830; Hu, G., Stationary solution of master equations in the largesystem-size limit (1987) Physical Review A, 36 (12), pp. 5782-5790; Black, A.J., McKane, A.J., WKB calculation of an epidemic outbreak distribution (2011) Journal of Statistical Mechanics: Theory and Experiment, 2011 (12). , http://iopscience.iop.org/1742-5468/2011/12/P12006; Forgoston, E., Bianco, S., Shaw, L.B., Schwartz, I.B., Maximal sensitive dependence and the optimal path to epidemic extinction (2011) Bulletin of Mathematical Biology, 73 (3), pp. 495-514; Lindley, B.S., Schwartz, I.B., An iterative action minimizing method for computing optimal paths in stochastic dynamical systems (2013) Physica D.

The three-dimensional discrete SIRS epidemic models are more suitable than the two-dimensional discrete models to describe the spreading characters of the diseases. In this paper, the complex dynamical behaviors of a three-dimensional discrete SIRS epidemic model with standard incidence rate are discussed. We choose the time step size parameter as a bifurcation parameter, the existence, stability, and direction of Hopf bifurcation are proved by using the normal form theorem and bifurcation theory. Moreover, the numerical simulations not only illustrate our results, but they also exhibit the complex dynamical behaviors, such as the invariant cycle, period-7 orbits and period-12 orbits with more than one attractors and chaotic sets. The flip bifurcation caused by the step size parameter is also obtained by a numerical simulation. Most importantly, when the adequate contact rate and the death rate of the infective individuals are chosen as the bifurcation parameters, there also exist a Hopf bifurcation, a flip bifurcation, chaos, and strange attractors. These results provide significant information for the disease controlling when there appear complex dynamical behaviors in the epidemic model. © 2016, Hu et al.","chaos; complex dynamical behavior; discrete SIRS model; flip bifurcation; Hopf bifurcation",,"Zhou, L., Fan, M., Dynamics of an SIR epidemic model with limited medical resources revisited (2012) Nonlinear Anal., Real World Appl., 13, pp. 312-324; Alexanderian, A., Gobbert, M.K., Fister, K.R., Gaff, H., Lenhart, S., Schaefe, E., An age-structured model for the spread of epidemic cholera: analysis and simulation (2011) Nonlinear Anal., Real World Appl., 12, pp. 3483-3498; Zhang, H., Chen, L., Nieto, J.J., A delayed epidemic model with stage-structure and pulses for pest management strategy (2008) Nonlinear Anal., Real World Appl., 9, pp. 1714-1726; Robledo, G., Grognard, F., Gouzé, J.L., Global stability for a model of competition in the chemostat with microbial inputs (2012) Nonlinear Anal., Real World Appl., 13, pp. 582-598; Mena-Lorca, J., Hethcote, H.W., Dynamical models of infectious disease as regulations of population sizes (1992) J.

We assume time dependent vaccination which confers the same immunity as natural infection. We study two types of vaccination strategies: (i) optimal vaccination, in the sense that it minimizes the effort of vaccination in the set of vaccination strategies for which, for any sufficiently small perturbation of the disease free state, the number of infectious individuals is monotonically decreasing; (ii) Nash-equilibria strategies where all individuals simultaneously minimize the joint risk of vaccination versus the risk of the disease. The former case corresponds to an optimal solution for mandatory vaccinations, while the second corresponds to the equilibrium to be expected if vaccination is fully voluntary. We are able to show the existence of both optimal and Nash strategies in a general setting. In general, these strategies will not be functions but Radon measures. For specific forms of the transmission rate, we provide explicit formulas for the optimal and the Nash vaccination strategies. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Epidemiological models; Game theory; Seasonal epidemics; Vaccination strategies","decision making; epidemic; human; population density; procedures; season; statistical model; systemic inflammatory response syndrome; vaccination; Choice Behavior; Epidemics; Humans; Models, Statistical; Population Density; Seasons; Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome; Vaccination","Agur, Z., Cojocaru, L., Mazor, G., Anderson, R.M., Danon, Y.L., Pulse mass measles vaccination across age cohorts (1993) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 90 (24), pp. 11698-11702; Aliprantis, C.D., Border, K.C., (1999) Infinite dimensional analysis.

The role of environmental conditions on driving beetle outbreaks is becoming increasingly important as global climatic change alters environmental factors, such as drought stress, that, in turn, govern tree resistance. Furthermore, dynamics between beetles and trees are highly nonlinear, due to complex aggregation behaviors exhibited by beetles attacking trees. Models have a role to play in helping unravel the effects of variable tree resistance and beetle aggregation on bark beetle outbreaks. In this article we develop a new mathematical model for bark beetle outbreaks using an analogy with epidemiological models. Because the model operates on several distinct time scales, singular perturbation methods are used to simplify the model. The result is a dynamical system that tracks populations of uninfested and infested trees. A limiting case of the model is a discontinuous function of state variables, leading to solutions in the Filippov sense. The model assumes an extensive seed-bank so that tree recruitment is possible even if trees go extinct. Two scenarios are considered for immigration of new beetles. The first is a single tree stand with beetles immigrating from outside while the second considers two forest stands with beetle dispersal between them. For the seed-bank driven recruitment rate, when beetle immigration is low, the forest stand recovers to a beetle-free state. At high beetle immigration rates beetle populations approach an endemic equilibrium state. At intermediate immigration rates, the model predicts bistability as the forest can be in either of the two equilibrium states: a healthy forest, or a forest with an endemic beetle population. The model bistability leads to hysteresis. Interactions between two stands show how a less resistant stand of trees may provide an initial toe-hold for the invasion, which later leads to a regional beetle outbreak in the resistant stand. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Bark beetle; Bistability; Dendroctonus ponderosae; Dispersal; Filippov solution; Hysteresis; Population dynamics; SI models; Stability","beetle; dispersal; hysteresis; numerical model; pest outbreak; population dynamics; Article; bark beetle; beetle; conservational seed bank; epidemic; forest stand; hysteresis; mathematical model; nonhuman; parasite migration; pest infestation; population dispersal; prediction; priority journal; species invasion; tree; animal; bark; beetle; biological model; parasitology; physiology; plant disease; Coleoptera; Dendroctonus ponderosae; Scolytinae; Animals; Beetles; Disease Outbreaks; Models, Biological; Plant Bark; Plant Diseases","Addison, A., Powell, J.A., Bentz, B.J., Six, D.L., Integrating models to investigate critical phenological overlaps in complex ecological interactions: the mountain pine beetle–fungus symbiosis (2015) J.

First we prove that, upon a suitable mathematical reformulation of the basic reproduction number, the homogeneous system and the heterogeneous system exhibit a completely analogous global behaviour. Then we consider noise terms to incorporate the uctuation effects and the random import of the disease into the population and analyse the inuence of heterogeneity on warning signs for critical transitions (or tipping points). This theory shows that one may be able to anticipate whether a bifurcation point is close before it happens. We use numerical simulations of a stochastic fast-slow heterogeneous population SIS model and show various aspects of heterogeneity have crucial inuences on the scaling laws that are used as early-warning signs for the homogeneous system. Thus, although the basic structural qualitative dynamical properties are the same for both systems, the quantitative features for epidemic prediction are expected to change and care has to be taken to interpret potential warning signs for disease outbreaks correctly.","Critical transition;

A comprehensive analysis of the asymptotic behaviour of the disease is given, based on an explicit aggregation of the model. The results are compared with those of a homogeneous version of the model to highlight the influence of the heterogeneity on the asymptotics. Moreover, the performed analysis reveals in which cases incomplete information about the heterogeneity of the population is sufficient in order to determine the long-run outcome of the disease. Numerical simulation is used to emphasize that, for a given level of prevalence, the evolution of the disease under the influence of heterogeneity may in the long run qualitatively differ from the one 'predicted' by the homogeneous model. Furthermore, it is shown that, in a closed population, the indicator for the survival of the population is in the presence of heterogeneity distinct from the basic reproduction number. © The authors 2015.","Heterogeneous epidemiological models; Mathematical epidemiology; SI model","Communicable Diseases; human; theoretical model; Communicable Diseases; Epidemiology; Humans; Models, Theoretical","Bansal, S., Grenfell, B.T., Meyers, L.A., When individual behaviour matters: homogeneous and network models in epidemiology (2007) J.

Based on the SIR model, we established a comprehensive spatiotemporal risk assessment model to compute infectious disease propagation within an urban setting using Beijing, China as a case study. The model was developed for a dynamic population distribution using actual data on location, density of residences and offices, and means of public transportation (e.g., subways, buses and taxis). We evaluated four influencing factors including biological, behavioral, environmental parameters and infectious sources. The model output resulted in a set of maps showing how the four influencing factors affected the trend and characteristics of airborne infectious disease propagation in Beijing. We compared the scenarios for the long-term dynamic propagation of infectious disease without governmental interventions versus scenarios with government intervention and hospital coordinated emergency responses. Lastly, the sensitivity of the average number of people at different location in spreading infections is analyzed. Based on our results, we provide valuable recommendations to governmental agencies and the public in order to minimize the disease propagation. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Airborne; Epidemics; Infectious disease; Public health; Risk analysis","Crack propagation; Health risks; Losses; Population statistics; Public health; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Airborne; Environmental parameter; Epidemics; Government intervention; Governmental intervention; Infectious disease; Infectious disease propagation; Risk assessment models; Diseases; infectious disease; metropolitan area; population distribution; public health; risk assessment; spatiotemporal analysis; age; airborne infection; Article; case study; China; chronic disease; controlled study; disease transmission; educational status; emergency care; environmental factor; gender; government regulation; infection risk; mathematical model; population density; population distribution; population dynamics; priority journal; residential area; risk assessment; smoking; social behavior; traffic and transport; urban area; adolescent; adult; aged; communicable disease; female; human; male; middle aged; public health; risk assessment; theoretical model; transmission; young adult; Beijing [Beijing (ADS)]; Beijing [China]; China; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Beijing; Communicable Diseases; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Models, Theoretical; Public Health; Risk Assessment; Young Adult","Beijing air pollution (2010), http://aqicn.org/city/beijing/, Available from; Census Information of Beijing (2009), China statistics Press; Boccara, N., Cheong, K., Critical behaviour of a probabilistic automata network SIS model for the spread of an infectious disease in a population of moving individuals (1993) J.

This paper presents a study of particle filtering based algorithms for estimation and forecasting the number of Ebola cases, using the World Health Organisation (WHO) observations collected during the 2014/2015 epidemic in West Africa. The dynamics of the Ebola epidemic is modelled using a stochastic and discrete version of the susceptible, exposed, infected, removed (SEIR) compartmental model. The likelihood function of the observed number of cases is adopted as a negative binomial distribution with the variance as a free parameter. Progressive correction is used to make the method more robust against data irregularities. For the sake of comparison and performance assessment, an error performance measure is defined as the Bhattacharyya distance between the reported number of cases and the estimated/forecasted number of cases. © 2016 ISIF.","Bayesian stochastic filtering; Ebola virus epidemic; Epidemiology; particle filter","Diseases; Forecasting; Information fusion; Monte Carlo methods; Signal filtering and prediction; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Viruses; Bhattacharyya distance; Ebola virus; Negative binomial distribution; Particle filter; Performance assessment; Progressive correction; Real-time forecasting; Stochastic filtering; Epidemiology","Ajelli, M., Gonaves, B., Balcan, D., Colizza, V., Hu, H., Ramasco, J., Vespignani, A., Comparing large-scale computational approaches to epidemic modeling: Agent-based versus structured metapopulation models (2010) BMC Infectious Diseases, 10 (1), p. 190; Brown, D., Computer modelers vs. Ebola (2015) IEEE Spectrum, 52 (6), pp. 62-67; Jazwinski, A.H., (1970) Stochastic Processes and Filtering Theory, , Academic Press; Brauer, F., Compartmental models in epidemiology (2008) Mathematical Epidemiology, pp. 19-79. , Springer; Cazelles, B., Chau, N.P., Using the Kalman filter and dynamic models to assess the changing HIV/AIDS epidemic (1997) Mathematical Bioscienses, 140 (2), pp. 131-154; Shaman, J., Karspeck, A., Forecasting seasonal outbreaks of influenza (2012) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 109 (50), pp. 20425-20430; Skvortsov, A., Ristic, B., Monitoring and prediction of an epidemic outbreak using syndromic observations (2012) Mathematical Biosciences, 240 (1), pp. 12-19; Yang, W., Karspeck, A., Shaman, J., Comparison of filtering methods for the modeling and retrospective forecasting of influenza epidemics (2014) PioS Computational Biology, 10 (4), p. e1003583; Gomes, M.F.C., Pastore, Y., Piontti, A., Rossi, L., Chao, D., Longini, T., Halloran, M.E., Vespignani, A., Assessing the international spreading risk associated with the 2014 West African Ebola outbreak (2014) PioS Currents, 6; Drake, J.M., Kaul, R.B., Alexander, L.W., O'Regan, S.M., Kramer, A.M., Pulliamand, M.J., Ferrari, J.T., Park, A.W., Ebola cases and health system demand in Liberia (2015) PioS Biology, 13 (1); Shaman, J., Yang, W., Kandula, S., Inference and forecast of the current West African Ebola outbreak in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia (2014) PioS Currents, 6; Oudjane, N., Musso, C., Progressive correction for regularized particle filters (2000) Proc. 3rd Int.

Mathematical models might be of great use in predicting different system dynamics because models have the potential to predict the system response due to different changes in system parameters. In this paper, we study a predator-prey-parasite (PPP) system where prey population is infected by some micro parasites and predator-prey interaction occurs following Leslie-Gower model with type II response function. Infection spreads following SI type epidemic model with standard incidence rate. The infection process is not instantaneous but mediated by a fixed incubation delay. We study the stability and instability of the endemic equilibrium point of the delay-induced PPP system with respect to two parameters, viz., the force of infection and the length of incubation delay under two cases: (i) the corresponding non-delayed system is stable and (ii) the corresponding non-delayed system is unstable. In the first case, the system populations coexist in stable state for all values of delay if the force of infection is low; or show oscillatory behavior when the force of infection is intermediate and the length of delay crosses some critical value. The system, however, exhibits very complicated dynamics if the force of infection is high, where the system is unstable in absence of delay. In this last case, the system shows oscillatory, stable or chaotic behavior depending on the length of delay. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","Chaos; Hopf bifurcation; Leslie-Gower predator-prey model; Period doubling; Standard incidence","Chaos theory; Hopf bifurcation; Endemic equilibrium; Oscillatory behaviors; Period doubling; Predator-prey interaction; Predator-prey modeling; Stability and instability; Standard incidence rate; Trophic interactions; Predator prey systems; bifurcation; incubation; parasite; predator-prey interaction; Article; chaotic dynamics; disease course; disease simulation; disease transmission; endemic disease; Hopf bifurcation; incidence; incubation delay; infection rate; mathematical analysis; mathematical computing; mathematical model; mathematical parameters; plots and curves; predator prey interaction; predator prey parasite model; animal; biological model; food chain; parasite; parasitosis; Animals; Food Chain; Models, Biological; Parasites; Parasitic Diseases","Leslie, P.H., Some further notes on the use of matrices in population mathematics (1948) Biometrica, 35, pp. 213-245; Leslie, P.H., Gower, J.C., The properties of a stochastic model for the predator-prey type of interaction between two species (1960) Biometrica, 47, pp. 219-234; Pielou, E.C., (1969) An Introduction to Mathematical Ecology, , Wiley-Interscience, New York; Sieber, M., Malchow, H., Hilker, F.M., Disease-induced modification of prey competition in eco-epidemiological models (2014) Ecol.

Here, we contrast several common reproduction measures applied to stochastic compartmental models, and introduce a new quantity dubbed the ""empirically adjusted reproductive number"" with several advantages. These include: more complete use of the underlying compartmental dynamics than common alternatives, use as a potential diagnostic tool to detect the presence and causes of intensity process underfitting, and the ability to provide timely feedback on disease spread. Conceptual connections between traditional reproduction measures and our approach are explored, and the behavior of our method is examined under simulation. Two illustrative examples are developed: First, the single location applications of our method are established using data from the 1995 Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and a traditional stochastic SEIR model. Second, a spatial formulation of this technique is explored in the context of the ongoing Ebola outbreak in West Africa with particular emphasis on potential use in model selection, diagnosis, and the resulting applications to estimation and prediction. Both analyses are placed in the context of a newly developed spatial analogue of the traditional SEIR modeling approach. © 2015, The International Biometric Society.","Disease modeling; Epidemic prediction; Model selection; Spatial epidemiology; Spatial SEIR; Underspecification","disease spread; disease transmission; epidemic; epidemiology; health monitoring; stochasticity; traditional medicine; viral disease; Africa; computer simulation; disease transmission; epidemic; Hemorrhagic Fever, Ebola; human; Markov chain; statistical model; statistics and numerical data; Africa, Western; Computer Simulation; Disease Outbreaks; Disease Transmission, Infectious; Hemorrhagic Fever, Ebola; Humans; Models, Statistical; Stochastic Processes",,"Biometrics",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85027958112

We focus on whether or not a major outbreak (i.e. an epidemic that will go on to infect a large number of individuals) can be predicted reliably soon after initial cases of disease have appeared within a population. For emerging epidemics, significant time and effort is spent recording symptomatic cases. Scientific attention has often focused on improving statistical methodologies to estimate disease transmission parameters from these data. Here we show that, even if symptomatic cases are recorded perfectly, and disease spread parameters are estimated exactly, it is impossible to estimate the probability of a major outbreak without ambiguity. Our results therefore provide an upper bound on the accuracy of forecasts of major outbreaks that are constructed using data on symptomatic cases alone. Accurate prediction of whether or not an epidemic will occur requires records of symptomatic individuals to be supplemented with data concerning the true infection status of apparently uninfected individuals. To forecast likely future behavior in the earliest stages of an emerging outbreak, it is therefore vital to develop and deploy accurate diagnostic tests that can determine whether asymptomatic individuals are actually uninfected, or instead are infected but just do not yet show detectable symptoms. © 2016 Thompson et al.",,"Article; calculation; compartment model; controlled study; diagnostic test; Ebola hemorrhagic fever; epidemic; incubation time; infection; mathematical analysis; mathematical computing; measurement accuracy; plots and curves; prediction and forecasting; presymptomatic infection; probability; SEIR model; simulation; stochastic model; Uganda; uncertainty; virus transmission; biological model; biology; Communicable Diseases, Emerging; early diagnosis; epidemic; forecasting; Hemorrhagic Fever, Ebola; human; Markov chain; procedures; statistical model; statistics and numerical data; Communicable Diseases, Emerging; Computational Biology; Diagnostic Tests, Routine; Disease Outbreaks; Early Diagnosis; Epidemics; Forecasting; Hemorrhagic Fever, Ebola; Humans; Models, Biological; Models, Statistical; Probability; Stochastic Processes","Matthews, L., Woolhouse, M., New approaches to quantifying the spread of infection (2005) Nature Rev Microbiol, 3, pp. 529-536. , .;:–; Woolhouse, M., How to make predictions about future infectious disease risks (2011) Phil Trans Roy Soc B, 366, pp. 2045-2054. , .;:–; Tildesley, M.J., Keeling, M.J., Is R0 a good predictor of final epidemic size: Foot-and-mouth disease in the UK (2009) J Theor Biol, 258, pp. 623-629. , 10.1016/j.jtbi.2009.02.019, 19269297, .;:–; Anderson, R.M., May, R.M., (1992) Infectious Diseases of Humans: Dynamics and Control, , .,;; Keeling, M.J., Rohani, P., (2008) Modelling Infectious Diseases in Humans and Animals, , .;; Anderson, D., Watson, R., On the spread of a disease with gamma distributed latent and infectious periods (1980) Biometrika, 67, pp. 191-198. , .;:–; Craft, M.E., Beyer, H.L., Haydon, D.T., Estimating the probability of a major outbreak from the timing of early cases: an indeterminate problem?

We first prove that this model has a unique global positive solution starting from the positive initial value. Then, taking the accumulated jump size into account, we find a threshold of the model, denoted by R∼0, which completely determines the extinction and prevalence of the disease: if R∼0&lt;1, the disease dies out exponentially with probability one; if R∼0&gt;1, the solution of the model tends to a point in time average which leads to the stochastical persistence of the disease. From the view of epidemiology, the existence of threshold is useful in determining treatment strategies and forecasting epidemic dynamics. Moreover, we find that Lévy noise can suppress disease outbreak. Finally, we introduce some numerical simulations to support the main results obtained. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Extinction; Ito formula; Lévy jumps; Persistence; Stochastic SIS epidemic model","Epidemiology; Light extinction; Stochastic systems; Disease outbreaks; Epidemic dynamics; Epidemic modeling; Ito formula; Persistence; Positive solution; Threshold behavior; Time averages; Stochastic models","Gray, A., A stochastic differential equation SIS epidemic model (2011) SIAM J.

We introduce a novel state filter algorithm to further improve the performance of state-of-the-art approaches based on Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) models. The proposed algorithm merges two techniques, which are typically used separately: linear correction, as seen in the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF), and resampling, as used in the Particle Filter (PF). We compare the inferential accuracy of our approach against the EnKF and the Ensemble Adjustment Kalman Filter (EAKF), using algorithms employing both an uncentered covariance matrix (UCM) and the standard column-centered covariance matrix (CCM). Our algorithm requires O(DN) more time than EnKF does, where D is the ensemble dimension and N denotes the ensemble size. We demonstrate empirically that our algorithm with UCM achieves the lowest root-mean-square-error (RMSE) and the highest correlation coefficient (CORR) amongst the selected methods, in 11 out of 14 major real-world scenarios. We show that the EnKF with UCM outperforms the EnKF with CCM, while the EAKF gains better accuracy with CCM in most scenarios. © 2016 The Authors and IOS Press.",,"Bandpass filters; Epidemiology; Kalman filters; Mean square error; Correlation coefficient; Ensemble adjustment Kalman filter; Ensemble Kalman Filter; Linear corrections; Real-world scenario; Root mean square errors; State-of-the-art approach; Susceptible-infected-recovered model; Covariance matrix","Aksoy, S., Muhurcu, A., Kizmaz, H., State and parameter estimation in induction motor using the Extended Kalman Filtering algorithm (2010) 2010 Modern Electric Power Systems, (3), pp. 1-5; Anderson, J.L., An ensemble adjustment kalman filter for data assimilation (2001) Monthly Weather Review, 129 (12), pp. 2884-2903; Sanjeev Arulampalam, M., Maskell, S., Gordon, N., Clapp, T., A tutorial on particle filters for online nonlinear/non-Gaussian Bayesian tracking (2002) IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing, 50 (2), pp. 174-188; Bailey, N.T.J., (1975) The Mathematical Theory of Infectious Diseases and its Applications, , Books on cognate subjects, Griffin; Cadima, J., Jolliffe, I., On relationships between uncentred and column-centred principal component analysis (2009) Pak J Statist, 25 (4), pp. 473-503; Carvalho, C.M., Johannes, M.S., Lopes, H.F., Polson, N.G., Particle learning and smoothing (2010) Statistical Science, 25 (1), pp. 88-106; United States Influenzalike Illnesses Data, , http://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/fluview/fluportaldashboard.html; Chen, Z., Bayesian filtering: From kalman filters to particle filters, and beyond (2003) Statistics, 182 (1), pp. 1-69; Chustagulprom, N., Reich, S., Reinhardt, M., (2015) A Hybrid Ensemble Transform Filter for Nonlinear and Spatially Extended Dynamical Systems, , ArXiv e-prints, sep; Doucet, A., Johansen, A., A tutorial on particle filtering and smoothing: Fifteen years later (2011) Handbook of Nonlinear Filtering, pp. 656-704. , December; Evensen, G., The ensemble kalman filter: Theoretical formulation and practical implementation (2003) Ocean Dynamics, 53 (4), pp. 343-367; Evensen, G., (2009) Data Assimilation: The Ensemble Kalman Filter, , Springer Science & Business Media; Evensen, G., The ensemble kalman filter for combined state and parameter estimation (2009) IEEE Control Systems, 29 (3), pp. 83-104; Frei, M., Künsch, H.R., Bridging the ensemble kalman and particle filters (2013) Biometrika, 100 (4), pp. 781-800; Ginsberg, J., Mohebbi, M.H., Patel, R.S., Brammer, L., Smolinski, M.S., Brilliant, L., Detecting influenza epidemics using search engine query data (2009) Nature, 457 (7232), pp. 1012-1014; Google Flu Trends, , https://www.google.org/flutrends; Gupta, N., Kalman filtering in the presence of state space equality (2007) Control Conference, 2007.

There exist different models in the literature to predict its behavior, most of them based on data coming from previous outbreaks or using restricted number of persons in the population variable. This paper deals both with classical and fractional order SEIR (susceptible, exposed, infections, removed) Ebola epidemic model and its comparison with real data extracted from the reports periodically published by the World Health Organization (WHO), starting from March 27th, 2014. As it has been shown in the literature, one physical meaning of the fractional order in fractional derivatives is that of index of memory; and therefore, it seems to be useful for epidemic models, as in this paper. The number of confirmed cases by the WHO in its reports is used for our analysis and estimation of the parameters in our classical and fractional SEIR models. Our approach gives a good approximation to real data. Following our results, the current outbreak will continue for approximately two years, assuming that no new outbreak appears at a different community or country.

Understanding the underlying mechanisms of epidemic cycling is essential for forecasting outbreaks of epidemics and therefore important for public health planning. Current theoretical effort is mainly focused on the factors that are extrinsic to the pathogens themselves (""extrinsic factors"") such as environmental variation and seasonal change in human behaviours and susceptibility. Nevertheless, co-circulation of different strains of a pathogen was usually observed and thus strains interact with one another within concurrent infection and during sequential infection. The existence of these intrinsic factors is common and may be involved in the generation of epidemic cycling of multi-strain pathogens. Methods and Findings: To explore the mechanisms that are intrinsic to the pathogens themselves (""intrinsic factors"") for epidemic cycling, we consider a multi-strain SIRS model including cross-immunity and infectivity enhancement and use seasonal influenza as an example to parameterize the model. The Kullback-Leibler information distance was calculated to measure the match between the model outputs and the typical features of seasonal flu (an outbreak duration of 11 weeks and an annual attack rate of 15%). Results show that interactions among strains can generate seasonal influenza with these characteristic features, provided that: the infectivity of a single strain within concurrent infection is enhanced 2-7 times that within a single infection; cross-immunity as a result of past infection is 0.5-0.8 and lasts 2-9 years; while other parameters are within their widely accepted ranges (such as a 2-3 day infectious period and the basic reproductive number of 1.8-3.0). Moreover, the observed alternation of the dominant strain among epidemics emerges naturally from the best fit model. Alternative modelling that also includes seasonal forcing in transmissibility shows that both external mechanisms (i.e. seasonal forcing) and the intrinsic mechanisms (i.e., strain interactions) are equally able to generate the observed time-series in seasonal flu. Conclusions: The intrinsic mechanism of strain interactions alone can generate the observed patterns of seasonal flu epidemics, but according to Kullback-Leibler information distance the importance of extrinsic mechanisms cannot be excluded. The intrinsic mechanism illustrated here to explain seasonal flu may also apply to other infectious diseases caused by polymorphic pathogens. © 2015 Xu-Sheng Zhang.

Grooming is an important sanitary behaviour—either performed towards oneself (self-grooming) or towards others (allogrooming)—to remove infectious agents from the body surface of exposed individuals, but at the risk of disease contraction by the groomer. We use garden ants (Lasius neglectus) and the fungal pathogen Metarhizium as a model system to study how pathogen presence affects self-grooming and allogrooming between exposed and healthy individuals. We develop an epidemiological SIS model to explore how experimentally observed grooming patterns affect disease spread within the colony, thereby providing a direct link between the expression and direction of sanitary behaviours, and their effects on colony-level epidemiology. We find that fungus-exposed ants increase self-grooming,while simultaneously decreasing allogrooming. This behavioural modulation seems universally adaptive and is predicted to contain disease spread in a great variety of host–pathogen systems. In contrast, allogrooming directed towards pathogen-exposed individuals might both increase and decrease disease risk. Our model reveals that the effect of allogrooming depends on the balance between pathogen infectiousness and efficiency of social host defences, which are likely to vary across host–pathogen systems. © 2015 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

The telegraph noise switches at random between two SIRS models. We give out conditions for the persistence of the disease and the stability of a disease free equilibrium. We show that the asymptotic behavior highly depends on the value of a threshold λ which is calculated from the intensities of switching between environmental states, the total size of the population as well as the parameters of both SIRS systems. According to the value of λ, the system can globally tend towards an endemic state or a disease free state. The aim of this work is also to describe completely the ω-limit set of all positive solutions to the model. Moreover, the attraction of the ω-limit set and the stationary distribution of solutions will be shown. © EDP Sciences, 2015.","Epidemiology; SIRS model; Stationary distribution; Telegraph noise","Epidemiology; Stochastic systems; Telegraph; Asymptotic behaviors; Disease-free equilibrium; Dynamical behaviors; Environmental state; SIRS epidemic model; SIRS models; Stationary distribution; Telegraph noise; Stochastic models","Artalejo, J.R., Economou, A., Lopez-Herrero, M.J., Stochastic epidemic models with random environment: Quasi-stationarity extinction and final size (2013) J.

Information dissemination, as a significant factor which impacts human behaviors, is emphasized in modeling the epidemic dynamics of infectious diseases. Individuals make behavior changes based on the information available to them during the game (e.g., an epidemic episode), by balancing their own benefits and costs. Both local information, which impacts contacts among people locally, and global information, which impacts people's travel behavior, are modelled using integro-differential equations system. Sensitivity analysis, equilibrium analysis, and numerical simulation are shown to validate the model.","Disease transmission; Human behaviors; Integro-differential model; Spatial game","Diseases; Epidemiology; Information dissemination; Integrodifferential equations; Sensitivity analysis; Virtual reality; Differential models; Disease transmission; Equilibrium analysis; Global informations; Human behaviors; Integro-differential equations systems; Spatial evolutionary games; Spatial games; Behavioral research","Tan, X., Li, S., Wang, C., Chen, X., Wu, X., Severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic and change of people's health behavior in China (2004) Health Education Research, 19 (5), pp. 576-580; Funk, S., Salathé, M., Jansen, V.A.A., Modelling the influence of human behaviour on the spread of infectious diseases: A review (2010) J.

By using the center manifold theorem and bifurcation theorem in the interior R+2, the specific conditions for the existence of flip bifurcation and Neimark-Sacker bifurcation have been derived. Numerical simulation not only presents our theoretical analysis but also exhibits rich and complex dynamical behavior existing in the case of the windows of period-1, period-3, period-5, period-6, period-7, period-9, period-11, period-15, period-19, period-23, period-34, period-42, and period-53 orbits. Meanwhile, there appears the cascade of period-doubling 2, 4, 8 bifurcation and chaos sets from the fixed point. These results show the discrete model has more richer dynamics compared with the continuous model. The computations of the largest Lyapunov exponents more than 0 confirm the chaotic behaviors of the system x → x + δ [rN(1 - N/K) - β(xy/N) - (μ+m) x ], y → y + δ [β xy/N - (μ+d)y ]. Specifically, the chaotic orbits at an unstable fixed point are stabilized by using the feedback control method.

Reasonably, the essential institutions were in place at that starting point; this work explores the possibility that the Sabbath is one of these institutions. Our mathematical examination points to the potential cultural, civic, and social role of the weekly Sabbath, that is, the Sabbath institution, in controlling deviation from social norms. It begins with an analogy between spread of transgression (defined as lack of conformity with social norms) and of biological infection. Borrowing well-known mathematical methods, we derive solution sets of social equilibrium and study their social stability. The work shows how a weekly Sabbath could in theory enhance social resilience in comparison with a similar assembly with a more natural and longer period, say between New Moon and Full Moon. The examination reveals that an efficient Sabbath institution has the potential to ensure a stable organization and suppress occasional appearances of transgression from cultural norms and boundaries. The work suggests the existence of a sharp threshold governed by the “Basic Sabbath Number ש<inf>0</inf>”—a critical observance of the Sabbath, or large enough ש<inf>0</inf>, is required to ensure suppression of transgression. Subsequently, the model is used to explore an interesting question: how old is the Sabbath? The work is interdisciplinary, combining anthropological concepts with mathematical analysis and with archaeological parallels in regards to the findings. © 2015, The Author(s).","Cultural anthropology; Nonlinear dynamics; Periodic forcing; Sabbath; SIRS epidemic model; Social dynamics","Article; cultural anthropology; feasibility study; human; mathematical analysis; mathematical model; priority journal; religion; Sabbath; social aspect; social behavior; social norm; spiritual care; ethnology; heroin dependence; Israel; theoretical model; Heroin Dependence; Humans; Israel; Models, Theoretical; Religion; Social Behavior","Lowell, A., Shennan, S., Thomas, M.G., Late Pleistocene demography and the appearance of modern human behavior (2009) Science, 324 (5932), pp. 1298-1301; Baggs, I., Freedman, H.I., Can the speakers of a dominated language survive as unilinguals?: a mathematical model of bilingualism (1993) Math.

Various models have been proposed to infer details of the dynamics that describe epidemic progression. These include inference approaches derived from Kingman’s coalescent theory. Here, we use recently described coalescent theory for epidemic dynamics to develop stochastic and deterministic coalescent susceptible–infected–removed (SIR) tree priors. We implement these in a Bayesian phylogenetic inference framework to permit joint estimation of SIR epidemic parameters and the sample genealogy. We assess the performance of the two coalescent models and alsojuxtaposeresultsobtained with a recently published birth– death-sampling model for epidemic inference. Comparisons are made by analyzing sets of genealogies simulated under precisely known epidemiological parameters. Additionally, we analyze influenza A (H1N1) sequence data sampled in the Canterbury region of New Zealand and HIV-1 sequence data obtained from known United Kingdom infection clusters. We show that both coalescent SIR models are effective at estimating epidemiological parameters from data with large fundamental reproductive number R0and large population size S0: Furthermore, we find that the stochastic variant generally outperforms its deterministic counterpart in terms of error, bias, and highest posterior density coverage, particularly for smaller R0and S0: However, each of these inference models is shown to have undesirable properties in certain circumstances, especially for epidemic outbreaks with R0close to one or with small effective susceptible populations. © 2015, Genetics Society of America.

First, we show that the global positive solutions of the stochastic model belongs to a bounded positively invariant set with probability one. Then we obtain the threshold between persistence and extinction of diseases. Furthermore, we establish certain asymptotic results regarding large time behavior. The results show that the introduction of noise in the deterministic SIRS model can change the properties of the epidemic model significantly. © 2014, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Extinction; Persistence in mean; Stochastic epidemic model",,"Gani, J., Jerwood, D., Markov chain methods in chain binomial epidemic models (1971) Biometrics, 27, pp. 591-603; Yorke, J.A., London, W.P., Recurrent outbreaks of measles, chickenpox and mumps II (1973) Am.

The local stability of the disease-free equilibrium and endemic equilibrium is obtained. It is shown that the model undergoes flip bifurcation and Hopf bifurcation by using center manifold theorem and bifurcation theory. Numerical simulations not only illustrate our results, but also exhibit the complex dynamical behaviors, such as the period-doubling bifurcation in period-2, 4, 8, quasi-periodic orbits and the chaotic sets. These results reveal far richer dynamical behaviors of the discrete epidemic model compared with the continuous epidemic models although the discrete epidemic model is easy. © 2013 IMACS.

This study proposes a stochastic framework to integrate space-time dynamics in the form of a Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model, together with uncertain disease observations, into a Bayesian maximum entropy (BME) framework. The resulting model (BME-SIR) can be used to predict space-time disease spread. Specifically, it was applied to obtain a space-time prediction of the dengue fever (DF) epidemic that took place in Kaohsiung City (Taiwan) during 2002. In implementing the model, the SIR parameters were continually updated and information on new cases of infection was incorporated. The results obtained show that the proposed model is rigorous to user-specified initial values of unknown model parameters, that is, transmission and recovery rates. In general, this model provides a good characterization of the spatial diffusion of the DF epidemic, especially in the city districts proximal to the location of the outbreak. Prediction performance may be affected by various factors, such as virus serotypes and human intervention, which can change the space-time dynamics of disease diffusion. The proposed BME-SIR disease prediction model can provide government agencies with a valuable reference for the timely identification, control, and prevention of DF spread in space and time. © 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

These methods have found application in a range of disciplines and settings, including engineering design and forecasting, and, over the last two decades, have been applied to infectious disease epidemiology. For any system of interest, the ideal filter depends on the nonlinearity and complexity of the model to which it is applied, the quality and abundance of observations being entrained, and the ultimate application (e.g. forecast, parameter estimation, etc.). Here, we compare the performance of six state-of-the-art filter methods when used to model and forecast influenza activity. Three particle filters-a basic particle filter (PF) with resampling and regularization, maximum likelihood estimation via iterated filtering (MIF), and particle Markov chain Monte Carlo (pMCMC)-and three ensemble filters-the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF), the ensemble adjustment Kalman filter (EAKF), and the rank histogram filter (RHF)-were used in conjunction with a humidity-forced susceptible-infectious-recovered-susceptible (SIRS) model and weekly estimates of influenza incidence. The modeling frameworks, first validated with synthetic influenza epidemic data, were then applied to fit and retrospectively forecast the historical incidence time series of seven influenza epidemics during 2003-2012, for 115 cities in the United States. Results suggest that when using the SIRS model the ensemble filters and the basic PF are more capable of faithfully recreating historical influenza incidence time series, while the MIF and pMCMC do not perform as well for multimodal outbreaks. For forecast of the week with the highest influenza activity, the accuracies of the six model-filter frameworks are comparable; the three particle filters perform slightly better predicting peaks 1-5 weeks in the future; the ensemble filters are more accurate predicting peaks in the past. © 2014 Yang et al.",,"analytical error; article; disease activity; ensemble adjustment Kalman filter; ensemble Kalman filter; epidemic; filtration; incidence; influenza; intermethod comparison; iterated filtering; measurement accuracy; model; particle filter; particle Markov chain Monte Carlo; particulate matter; prediction and forecasting; prevalence; rank histogram filter; susceptible infectious recovered susceptible model; time series analysis; validation process; comparative study; epidemiology; forecasting; human; Influenza, Human; retrospective study; theoretical model; United States; validation study; Forecasting; Humans; Influenza, Human; Models, Theoretical; Retrospective Studies; United States","Molinari, N.-A.M., Ortega-Sanchez, I.R., Messonnier, M.L., Thompson, W.W., Wortley, P.M., The annual impact of seasonal influenza in the US: Measuring disease burden and costs (2007) Vaccine, 25, pp. 5086-5096; Ong, J.B., Chen, M.I., Cook, A.R., Lee, H.C., Lee, V.J., Real-time epidemic monitoring and forecasting of H1N1-2009 using influenza-like illness from general practice and family doctor clinics in Singapore (2010) PLoS One, 5, pp. e10036; Dukic, V., Lopes, H.F., Polson, N.G., Tracking epidemics with google flu trends data and a state-space SEIR model (2012) Journal of the American Statistical Association, 107, pp. 1410-1426; Shaman, J., Karspeck, A., Forecasting seasonal outbreaks of influenza (2012) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 109, pp. 20425-20430; Skvortsov, A., Ristic, B., Monitoring and prediction of an epidemic outbreak using syndromic observations (2012) Mathematical Biosciences, 240, pp. 12-19; Shaman, J., Karspeck, A., Lipsitch, M., (2013) Week 1 Influenza Forecast for the 2012-2013 US Season, , arXiv: 1301.3110; Shaman, J., Karspeck, A., Yang, W., Tamerius, J., Lipsitch, M., Real-time influenza forecasts during the 2012-2013 season (2013) Nat Commun, 4, p. 2837; (2013) FluView, , http://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; Goldstein, E., Cobey, S., Takahashi, S., Miller, J.C., Lipsitch, M., Predicting the Epidemic Sizes of Influenza A/H1N1, A/H3N2, and B: A Statistical Method (2011) PLoS Med, 8, pp. e1001051; (2013) Google Flu Trend, , http://www.google.org/flutrends, Google.org; Shaman, J., Pitzer, V.E., Viboud, C., Grenfell, B.T., Lipsitch, M., Absolute Humidity and the Seasonal Onset of Influenza in the Continental United States (2010) PLoS Biol, 8, pp. e1000316; Shaman, J., Kohn, M., Absolute humidity modulates influenza survival, transmission, and seasonality (2009) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 106, pp. 3243-3248; Anderson, J.L., A non-Gaussian ensemble filter update for data assimilation (2010) Mon Weather Rev, 138, pp. 4186-4198; Evensen, G., (2008) Sequential data assimilation.

The result indicates that the model undergoes a flip bifurcation and a Hopf bifurcation, as found by using the center manifold theorem and bifurcation theory. Numerical simulations not only illustrate our results, but they also exhibit the complex dynamical behaviors, such as the period-doubling bifurcation in period-2, -4, -8, quasi-periodic orbits and the chaotic sets. Specifically, when the parameters A, d<inf>1</inf>, d<inf>2</inf>, r, λ are fixed at some values and the bifurcation parameter h changes with different values, there exist local stability, Hopf bifurcation, 3-periodic orbits, 7-periodic orbits, period-doubling bifurcation and chaotic sets. These results reveal far richer dynamical behaviors of the discrete epidemic model compared with the continuous epidemic models although the discrete epidemic model is simple. Finally, the feedback control method is used to stabilize chaotic orbits at an unstable endemic equilibrium.©2014 Hu et al.; licensee Springer.","Bifurcation; Chaos; Discrete epidemic model; Feedback control",,"Franke, J.E., Yakubu, A.A., Disease-induced mortality in density-dependent discrete-time sis epidemic models (2008) Math.

Firstly, it makes the nonlinear singular system normalizable, realizes feedback linearization and the pole placement in a single step. Then, it constructs a performance index that is calculated explicitly as an algebraic function of the controller parameters by solving Zubov’s partial differential equation. Lastly, standard optimization techniques are employed for the calculation of the optimal values of the adjustable parameters. So we obtain the single-step optimal design of normalizability , feedback linearization with the pole placement for nonlinear singular system. The proposed approach is finally applied in a SIS model with logistic growth. The simulation result shows the feasibility and the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2014 Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.","Liapunov’s auxiliary theorem; Nonlinear singular system; Normalizability; Optimal Control; single-step design; Zubov’s method","Design; Differential equations; Disease control; Nonlinear feedback; Optimal systems; Poles; Poles and zeros; Nonlinear singular systems; Normalizability; Optimal controls; S-method; Single-step; Feedback linearization","Isidori, A., (1995) Nonlinear Control Systems, , Springer-Verlag, London.

The process of substrate getting adsorbed and digested by enzyme was simulated as susceptibles getting infected by viruses and becoming removed and recovered. This model simplified the dynamic enzyme ""infection"" process and the catalysis of cellulose into a two-parameter controlled, enzyme behavior guided mechanism. Furthermore, the model incorporates the adsorption block by lignin and inhibition effects on cellulose catalysis. The model satisfactorily predicted the enzyme adsorption and hydrolysis, negative role of lignin, and inhibition effects over hydrolysis for a broad range of substrate and enzyme loadings. Sensitivity analysis was performed to evaluate the incorporation of lignin and other inhibition effects. Our model will be a useful tool for evaluating the effects of parameters during hydrolysis and guide a design strategy for continuous hydrolysis and the associated process control. © 2014 American Institute of Chemical Engineers.","Bioconversion; Biofuels; Enzymatic hydrolysis; Kinetic modeling; SIR modeling","Adsorption; Bioconversion; Biofuels; Catalysis; Cellulose; Enzyme inhibition; Lignin; Process control; Sensitivity analysis; Viruses; Continuous hydrolysis; Design strategies; Dilute sulfuric acid; Enzyme adsorption; Inhibition effect; Kinetic modeling; Lignocellulosic biomass; SIR model; Enzymatic hydrolysis; biofuel; hydrolase; lignin; biological model; biomass; chemistry; hydrolysis; kinetics; metabolism; procedures; systems biology; Biofuels; Biomass; Hydrolases; Hydrolysis; Kinetics; Lignin; Models, Biological; Systems Biology","Van Wyk, J.P., Biotechnology and the utilization of biowaste as a resource for bioproduct development (2001) Trends Biotechnol, 19, pp. 172-177; Ghose, T., Ghosh, P., Bioconversion of cellulosic substances (1978) J Appl Chem Biotechnol, 28, pp. 309-320; Jeoh, T., Ishizawa, C.I., Davis, M.F., Himmel, M.E., Adney, W.S., Johnson, D.K., Cellulase digestibility of pretreated biomass is limited by cellulose accessibility (2007) Biotechnol Bioeng, 98, pp. 112-122; Yang, B., Wyman, C.E., Effect of xylan and lignin removal by batch and flowthrough pretreatment on the enzymatic digestibility of corn stover cellulose (2004) Biotechnol Bioeng, 86, pp. 88-98; Kadam, K.L., Rydholm, E.C., McMillan, J.D., Development and validation of a kinetic model for enzymatic saccharification of lignocellulosic biomass (2004) Biotechnol Progr, 20, pp. 698-705; Bezerra, R.M., Dias, A.A., Discrimination among eight modified Michaelis-Menten kinetics models of cellulose hydrolysis with a large range of substrate/enzyme ratios (2004) Appl Biochem Biotech, 112, pp. 173-184; Gan, Q., Allen, S., Taylor, G., Kinetic dynamics in heterogeneous enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulose: an overview, an experimental study and mathematical modelling (2003) Process Biochem, 38, pp. 1003-1018; Schnell, S., Maini, P.K., A century of enzyme kinetics: reliability of the KM and vmax estimates (2003) Comm.

Typically these models have not considered conformity bias, that is, the exaggerated propensity to adopt commonly observed behaviors or opinions, or content biases, where the content of the learned trait affects the probability of adoption. Here we consider an interaction of these two effects, presenting an SIS-type model for the spread and persistence of a behavior which is transmitted via social learning. Uptake is controlled by a nonlinear dependence on the proportion of individuals demonstrating the behavior in a population. Three equilibrium solutions are found, their linear stability is analyzed and the results are compared with a model for unbiased social learning. Our analysis focuses on the effects of the strength of conformity bias and the effects of content biases which alter a conformity threshold frequency of the behavior, above which there is an exaggerated propensity for adoption. The strength of the conformity bias is found to qualitatively alter the predictions regarding whether the trait becomes endemic within the population and the proportion of individuals who display the trait when it is endemic. As the conformity strength increases, the number of feasible equilibrium solutions increases from two to three, leading to a situation where the stable equilibrium attained is dependent upon the initial state. Varying the conformity threshold frequency directionally alters the behavior invasion threshold. Finally we discuss the possible application of this model to binge drinking behavior. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.","Binge drinking; Conformity; Cultural evolution; SIS; Social learning","cultural history; epidemiology; human behavior; learning; nonlinearity; social behavior; social theory; article; binge drinking; conformity; cultural anthropology; epidemiology; human; SIS; social learning; theoretical model; Binge drinking; Conformity; Cultural evolution; SIS; Social learning; Culture; Epidemiologic Studies; Humans; Models, Theoretical","Asch, S.E., Studies of independence and conformity: I.

First, we show that the system admits a unique positive global solution starting from the positive initial value. Then, the long-term asymptotic behavior of the model is studied: when R0≤1, we show how the solution spirals around the disease-free equilibrium of deterministic system under some conditions; when R0>1, we show that the stochastic model has a stationary distribution under certain parametric restrictions. In particular, we show that random effects may lead the disease to extinction in scenarios where the deterministic model predicts persistence. Finally, numerical simulations are carried out to illustrate the theoretical results. © 2013 Yanli Zhou et al.",,,"Capasso, V., Serio, G., A generalization of the Kermack-McKendrick deterministic epidemic model (1978) Mathematical Biosciences, 42 (1-2), pp. 43-61. , DOI 10.1016/0025-5564(78)90006-8; Liu, W.-M., Levin, S.A., Iwasa, Y., Influence of nonlinear incidence rates upon the behavior of SIRS epidemiological models (1985) Journal of Mathematical Biology, 23 (2), pp. 187-204. , DOI 10.1007/BF00276956; Hethcote, H.W., Qualitative analyses of communicable disease models (1976) Mathematical Biosciences, 28 (3-4), pp. 335-356. , MR0401216 10.1016/0025-5564(76)90132-2 ZBL0326.92017; Xiao, D., Ruan, S., Global analysis of an epidemic model with nonmonotone incidence rate (2007) Mathematical Biosciences, 208 (2), pp. 419-429. , DOI 10.1016/j.mbs.2006.09.025, PII S0025556406001866; Ruan, S., Wang, W., Dynamical behavior of an epidemic model with a nonlinear incidence rate (2003) Journal of Differential Equations, 188 (1), pp. 135-163. , DOI 10.1016/S0022-0396(02)00089-X, PII S002203960200089X; Liu, W.M., Hethcote, H.W., Levin, S.A., Dynamical behavior of epidemiological models with nonlinear incidence rates (1987) Journal of Mathematical Biology, 25 (4), pp. 359-380. , 10.1007/BF00277162 MR908379 ZBL0621.92014; Jin, Y., Wang, W., Xiao, S., An SIRS model with a nonlinear incidence rate (2007) Chaos, Solitons and Fractals, 34 (5), pp. 1482-1497. , DOI 10.1016/j.chaos.2006.04.022, PII S0960077906003882; Yang, Y., Xiao, D., Influence of latent period and nonlinear incidence rate on the dynamics of SIRS epidemiological models (2010) Discrete and Continuous Dynamical Systems B, 13 (1), pp. 195-211. , 10.3934/dcdsb.2010.13.195 MR2552773 ZBL1187.34121; Xu, R., Ma, Z., Global stability of a delayed SEIRS epidemic model with saturation incidence rate (2010) Nonlinear Dynamics, 61 (1-2), pp. 229-239. , 10.1007/s11071-009-9644-3 MR2661797 ZBL1204.34096; Xu, R., Ma, Z., Global stability of a SIR epidemic model with nonlinear incidence rate and time delay (2009) Nonlinear Analysis.

In this model, each cell does not correspond to an individual, but to groups of individuals inhabiting the physical space corresponding to the cell. The temporal evolution of the transmission consider is modeled by changes in the size of groups of individuals in each category (susceptible, infected and recovered). We applied our model on the spread of dengue in a region in Southeast Brazil. The application shows that the proposed model, using only a small set of simple fuzzy rules, is able to represent qualitatively the behavior of an epidemiological SIR mode, a rather complex problem. © Springer International Publishing 2013.","Cellular automata; Dengue; Fuzzy systems; Infectious diseases; SIR","Compartmental model; Complex problems; Dengue; Fuzzy cellular automata; Infectious disease; SIR; Southeast Brazil; Temporal evolution; Automata theory; Cellular automata; Fuzzy logic; Fuzzy systems; Dynamic models","http://biomat04.wikispaces.com/conceitos; Câmara, G., Cartaxo, R., De Souza, M., Pedrosa, B.M., Vinhas, L., Monteiro, A.M.V., Paiva, J.A., Gattass, M., TerraLib: Technology in Support of GIS Innovation II Brazilian Symposium on Geoinformatics, GeoInfo 2000, São Paulo (2000); Carneiro, T.G.S., (2006) Nested-CA: A Foundation for Multiscale Modeling of Land Use and Land Change, , PhD Thesis.

Most applications of the SIR framework use a form of nonlinear incidence to describe the number of new cases per instant. We adapt theorems to analyze the stability of SIR models with a generalized nonlinear incidence structure. These theorems are then applied to the case of standard incidence and incidence resulting from adaptive behavioral response based on epidemiological-economic theory. When adaptive behavior is included in the SIR model multiple equilibria and oscillatory epidemiological dynamics can occur over a greater parameter space. Our analysis, based on the epidemiological-economic incidence, provides new insights into epidemics as complex adaptive systems, highlights important nonlinearities that lead to complex behavior, and provides mechanistic motivation for a shift away from standard incidence, and outlines important areas of research related to the complex-adaptive dynamics of epidemics. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Adaptive behavior; Economic-epidemiology; Nonlinear incidence",,"Adda, J., Cooper, R., (2003) Dynamic Economics, Quantitative Methods Plus Applications, , The M.I.T.

In fact, spontaneous behavioral changes could develop as a defensive response during the spread of an epidemic, thereby impacting the epidemic dynamics and affecting timing and overall number of cases. In this chapter, a model coupling the classic SIR disease transmission model with an imitation dynamics process is introduced which accounts for the diffusion of different behaviors in the population as a response to the epidemic threat. A detailed analysis of the model identifies the main determinants leading to remarkable alterations in infection dynamics in both risk perception and diffusion of human behavioral patterns. Empirical evidence points to the need of incorporating human behavior in prediction models informing public health decisions. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

The models are extensions of the classical SIR model where the notion of two different strains is needed to describe primary and secondary infections. Ferguson et al. formulate and analyzed in Ferguson et al. (1999) [1] a two-strain model with Antibody Dependent Enhancement (ade), where the pre-existing antibodies to previous dengue infection cannot neutralize but rather enhance the new infection. No cross-immunity is assumed and therefore co-infection is possible and moreover individuals can belong to multiple compartments. In the modeling approach proposed by Billings et al. in (2007) [2] cross-infection is not possible as long as an individual is primarily infected. As a result all compartments are distinct. In the third model Aguiar et al. (2011) [9] starting from the Billings et al. model, temporary cross-immunity is introduced by additional compartments for the recovered from the primary infection. The study of the different models gives insight into how different long-term dynamic behavior originate. We use the same parameter set for all models, except the duration of the cross-immunity period in the last model which will be a bifurcation parameter. Another bifurcation parameter is the ade factor. Besides endemic equilibria and periodic solutions there is also chaotic behavior originating via different routes. Numerical bifurcation analysis, Lyapunov exponent calculation and simulation techniques (quantitative results) as well as symbolic analysis (qualitative results) are used to unravel the different types of long-term dynamics. When the cross-immunity period is moderately long or short the predictions show, besides similar chaotic dynamics as in the two models without temporal cross-immunity, a new chaotic attractor with a different origin. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

A key problem is the development of theory relating the dynamical processes of transmission to observable phenomena. In this paper, we consider compartmental susceptible-infectious-susceptible (SIS) and susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) models that are slowly forced through a critical transition. We derive expressions for the behavior of several candidate indicators, including the autocorrelation coefficient, variance, coefficient of variation, and power spectra of SIS and SIR epidemics during the approach to emergence or elimination. We validated these expressions using individual-based simulations. We further showed that moving-window estimates of these quantities may be used for anticipating critical transitions in infectious disease systems. Although leading indicators of elimination were highly predictive, we found the approach to emergence to be much more difficult to detect. It is hoped that these results, which show the anticipation of critical transitions in infectious disease systems to be theoretically possible, may be used to guide the construction of online algorithms for processing surveillance data. © 2013 The Author(s).","Bifurcation delay;

Interestingly, the propagation of tweets bears some similarity to the spread of infectious diseases. We present a method to model the tweets' spread behavior in microblogs based on the classic Susceptible-Infectious-Susceptible (SIS) epidemic model that was developed in the medical field for the spread of infectious diseases. On the basis of this model, future retweeting trends can be predicted. Our experiments on data obtained from the Chinese micro-blogging website Sina Weibo show that the proposed model has lower predictive error compared to the four commonly used prediction methods.","Prediction; Retweeting; SIS epidemic model; Tweets",,"Hong, L., Dan, O., Davison, B.D., Predicting popular messages in twitter (2011) Proceedings of the 20th International Conference Companion on World Wide Web, pp. 57-58. , March 28-April 1, 2011.

A well-known generic model type for the quantitative description of the epidemic evolution dynamics by an ordinary differential equation is provided by so-called SIR models. These models classify a population into “suscepti-ble” (S), “infected” (I) and “recovered” (R) subgroups. One very early and simple prototype of an SIR-model is due to Kermack and McKendrick (1927). It describes the population evolution by the system of ordinary differential equations (Equation presented), with transmission rate β > 0 and recovery rate γ > 0. This equation can be written in general form as (Equation presented), (1) where the epidemic interaction dynamics are modeled in the functions f and g. The variable “R” can be dropped since its evolution is already implicit in the equations. This basic SIR model can be extended by introducing a spatial distribution of both populations. In this contribution, it is shown how the spatial extension can be done by either a continuous or a discrete spatial distribution. For the continuous distribution, the model is typically formulated as a system of reaction-diffusion equations, where the reaction terms describe the local dynamics of susceptible and infected species, and the diffusion terms account for the spatial-distribution dynamics. For a discrete local distribution, the population is typically arranged in a series of patches. Each combination of population-type and patch corresponds to a particular variable. To describe the dynamics between different patches of the same population-type, the ordinary differential equations are extended by diffusion terms, which have an effect that is similar to the heat diffusion in Newton's law of cooling. The dynamics are the same for continuous and discrete spatial distributions. At each location, both populations are present and interact locally according to an ordinary differential equation that governs the local epidemic interaction-dynamics. In addition, the spatial distribution allows us to model a spatial diffusion, which can be either “self-diffusion” or “cross-diffusion”. For self-diffusion, the diffusion rate of each population depends on its particular local variation, whereas for cross-diffusion, the rate also depends on the local variation of the other population. For an SIR model, cross-diffusion is consistent with the phenomenon that the susceptible population avoids areas with an elevated percentage of the infected population. It is known that diffusion in general and self-diffusion in particular aim towards an equilibrium solution, where the populations are homogeneously distributed. On the other hand, the coupling of diffusion with ordinary differential equations might provoke a nonequilibrium behavior, which is known as Turing instability. The extended SIR model provides a spatial pattern formation that is essentially driven by cross-diffusion. In this contribution, nonlinear constitutive equations are suggested and analyzed for both self-diffusion and cross-diffusion. In particular, the modelling of cross-diffusion is reconsidered by starting from a basic SIR model, which is extended by either a discrete or continuous spatial distribution. Comparing the discrete model with patches to the continuous PDE model prepares the way for a micro-macro transition, where the continuous model can be deduced from the discrete. This deduction allows us to advance in the development of epidemic models with cross-diffusion. This is further elaborated in the complete version of the paper. © International Congress on Modelling and Simulation, MODSIM 2013.All right reserved.","Cross-diffusion; Epidemic model; Reaction-diffusion equation","Constitutive equations; Diffusion in liquids; Dynamic models; Dynamics; Epidemiology; Linear equations; Operations research; Ordinary differential equations; Partial differential equations; Population distribution; Cross-diffusion; Epidemic modeling; Modelling and simulations; Nonlinear constitutive equations; Quantitative description; Reaction diffusion equations; Spatial pattern formation; System of ordinary differential equations; Nonlinear equations","Aly, S., Farkas, M., Bifurcations in a predator-prey model in a patchy environment with diffusion (2004) Nonlin.

To achieve that, the influences that super spreader, age structure and group behavior impacted on the transmission had to be quantitatively evaluated. This paper was to propose a method capable of quantitatively analyzing the influences. First of all, the SEIR model got improved with influenza spread characteristics within terminal in individual level. Then behaviors of passengers in different groups optimized the social force model. Besides, both of them were fused in simulations within a terminal. Experiments indicated that super spreader impacted a lot on influenza transmission in departure; group behavior imposed a great influence on the spread in arrival and age structure generated a little impact. In departure and arrival, intervention strategies should get adjusted to arrest influenza development.","Age Structure; Grout behavior; Individual contacts based SEIR model; Influenza spread; Social force model; Super spreader","adult; age distribution; air conditioning; article; disease predisposition; group dynamics; human; infection rate; influenza; middle aged; nonhuman; pandemic; pedestrian; probability; social behavior; traffic and transport; virus transmission; walking speed; young adult","Song, G.-P., Jiang, Y.-R., Xu, J.-G., An epidemic spreading model in adaptive networks based on cellular automata (2011) Acta Physica Sinica, 60 (12), pp. 120509-120510; Hu, B., Gong, J., Individual-based distributed epidemic spread model (2010) Geoinformatics, pp. 1-6. , 2010 18th International Conference on.

In our work we will classify individuals as either a susceptible individual S or an infected individual I. Two SIS epidemic models in two competing species are formulated and analyzed. The two species are both subject to a disease. We analyze two different types of incidence, standard incidence and mass action incidence. Thresholds are identified which determine the existence of equilibria, when the populations will survive and when the disease remains endemic. Also stability results are proved. Using Hopf bifurcation theory some results of complicated dynamic behavior of the models are shown. With the interinfection rate of disease between the two species as a bifurcation parameter, it is shown that the model exhibits a Hopf bifurcation leading to a family of periodic solutions.","Competition model; Hopf bifurcation; Routh-herwitz criterion; SIS",,"Anderson, R.M., May, R.M., The invasion, persistence, and spread of infectious diseases within animal and plant communities (1986) Philos.

In this stochastic process, there are two competing mechanism: infection and recovery. Susceptible individuals may contract the disease from infected individuals, while infected ones recover from the disease at a constant rate and are never infected again. Our focus is the behavior at the epidemic threshold where the rates of the infection and recovery processes balance. In the infinite population limit, we establish analytically scaling rules for the time-dependent distribution functions that characterize the sizes of the infected and the recovered sub-populations. Using heuristic arguments, we also obtain scaling laws for the size and duration of the epidemic outbreaks as a function of the total population. We perform numerical simulations to verify the scaling predictions and discuss the consequences of these scaling laws for nearthreshold epidemic outbreaks. © EDP Sciences, Società Italiana di Fisica, Springer-Verlag 2012.",,"Competing mechanisms; Constant rate; Epidemic threshold; Infectious disease; Recovery process; Scaling behavior; Scaling prediction; Scaling rules; Sub-populations; Susceptible-infected-recovered model; Time-dependent; Epidemiology; Random processes; Scaling laws; Recovery","McNeill, M., (1989) Plagues and People, , Anchor Books, New York; Oldstone, M., (1998) Viruses Plagues and History, , (Oxford University Press, Oxford; Bernoulli, D., Mem.

The aim of the paper is to study some continuous characteristics of the epidemic. In this sense, we first extend the classical study of the length of an outbreak by investigating the whole probability distribution of the extinction time via Laplace transforms. Moreover, we also study two almost new epidemic descriptors, namely, the time until a non-infected individual becomes infected and the time until the individual is removed from the infective group. The obtained results are illustrated by numerical examples including an application to a stochastic SIS model for head lice infections. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","extinction time; head lice; recovery time; stochastic SIR model; stochastic SIS model; time to infection","animal; article; biological model; epidemic; human; parasitology; pediculosis; Pediculus; physiology; probability; statistics; time; Animals; Epidemics; Humans; Lice Infestations; Models, Biological; Pediculus; Probability; Stochastic Processes; Time Factors; Pediculus humanus","Abate, J., Whitt, W., Numerical inversion of Laplace transforms of probability distributions (1995) ORSA J.

For this purpose, we introduce, in a naïve discrete-time SIRS model, seasonal variability (i) in the loss of immunity and (ii) in the infection probability, modeled by sequences of kicks. Effects of a variable population size (assumed as logistic) are also analyzed. Restrictive assumptions are made on the parameters of the models, in order to guarantee that the transitions are determined by true probabilities, so that comparisons with stochastic discrete-time previsions can be also provided. Numerical simulations show that the characteristics of real infectious diseases can be adequately modeled. © 2012 World Scientific Publishing Company.","chaos; dynamical systems; epidemiology; Population dynamics","Chaos theory; Diseases; Dynamical systems; Epidemiology; Population dynamics; Population statistics; Stochastic systems; Deterministic epidemic models; Discrete time; Infectious disease; Seasonal variability; SIRS models; Variable population sizes; Stochastic models","Allen, L.J.S., Some discrete-time SI, SIR, and SIS epidemic models (1994) Math.

Data-driven models aim at a granularity down to the level of households or single individuals. However, relatively little systematic work has been done to provide coupled behavior-disease models able to close the feedback loop between behavioral changes triggered in the population by an individual's perception of the disease spread and the actual disease spread itself. While models lacking this coupling can be extremely successful in mild epidemics, they obviously will be of limited use in situations where social disruption or behavioral alterations are induced in the population by knowledge of the disease. Here we propose a characterization of a set of prototypical mechanisms for self-initiated social distancing induced by local and non-local prevalence-based information available to individuals in the population. We characterize the effects of these mechanisms in the framework of a compartmental scheme that enlarges the basic SIR model by considering separate behavioral classes within the population. The transition of individuals in/out of behavioral classes is coupled with the spreading of the disease and provides a rich phase space with multiple epidemic peaks and tipping points. The class of models presented here can be used in the case of data-driven computational approaches to analyze scenarios of social adaptation and behavioral change. © 2011 Perra et al.",,"article; behavior disorder; conceptual framework; feedback system; mathematical analysis; mathematical model; perception; prevalence; social adaptation; social behavior; social distance; epidemic; human; theoretical model; Disease Outbreaks; Humans; Models, Theoretical","Ferguson, N., Capturing human behaviour (2007) Nature, 466, p. 733; Funk, S., Salathé, M., Jansen, V.A.A., Modelling the inuence of human behaviour on the spread of infectious diseases: a review (2010) J R Soc Interface, 7, pp. 1247-1256; Wallinga, J., Teunis, P., Kretzschmar, M., Using data on social contacts to estimate age-specific transmission parameters for respiratory-spread infectious agents (2006) Am J Epi, 164, pp. 936-944; Merler, S., Ajelli, M., The role of population heterogeneity and human mobility in the spread of pandemic inuenza (2010) Proc Roy Soc B: Biol Sci, 277, pp. 557-565; Balcan, D., Colizza, V., Gonçalves, B., Hu, H., Ramasco, J., Multiscale mobility networks and the large scale spreading of infectious diseases (2009) Proc Natl Acad Sci, 106, pp. 21484-22189; Colizza, V., Barrat, A., Barthélemy, Valleron, M.A.J., Vespignani, A., Modeling the worldwide spread of pandemic inuenza: Baseline case and containment interventions (2007) PLoS Med, 4, pp. e13; Colizza, V., Barrat, A., Barthélemy, Vespignani, A., The role of the airline transportation network in the prediction and predictability of global epidemics (2006) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 103, pp. 2015-2020; Hollingsworth, T., Ferguson, N., Anderson, R., Will travel restrictions control the international spread of pandemic inuenza?

Restrictive assumptions are made on the parameters of the models, in order to guarantee that the transitions are determined by true probabilities, so that comparisons with stochastic discrete-time previsions can be also provided.

Consequently, a welldefined model should be able to carry out some predictions and be fitted to observational data in a variety of time measurements (seconds, hours, days, weeks, months, or years). Therefore, the time scales approach also plays an important role in the model. In this paper, we construct a time scales version of a simple epidemic model (SIS) and explore the variety of its qualitative behavior. For each parameter value, the theory of time scales allows the discovery of similar and dissimilar behavior of SIS epidemic models on different time scales. Finally, the dynamic behavior shows a period doubling bifurcation path to chaos as the distance of equally spaced points in time increases.","Bifurcation; Chaos; Limit cycles; Period doubling; SIS epidemic model; Time scales analysis","Different time scale; Discrete time; Dynamic behaviors; Epidemic models; Limit cycle; Observational data; Parameter values; Period doubling; Period doubling bifurcation; Qualitative behavior; Real-world system; Time-scales; Time-scales analysis; Bifurcation (mathematics); Computer simulation; Continuous time systems; Difference equations; Epidemiology; Real time systems; Time measurement; Mathematical models","Agarwal, R., Bohner, M., O'Regan, D., Peterson, A., Dynamic equations on time scales: A survey (2002) Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics, 141 (1-2), pp. 1-26. , DOI 10.1016/S0377-0427(01)00432-0, PII S0377042701004320; Akin, E., Erbe, L., Peterson, A., Kaymakçalan, B., Oscillation results for a dynamic equation on a time scale (2001) Journal of Difference Equations and Applications, 7, pp. 793-810; Anderson, D.R., Oscillation and nonoscillation criteria for twodimensional time-scale systems of first-order nonlinear dynamic equations (2009) Electronic Journal of Differential Equations, 2009, pp. 1-13; Hoffacker, J., Tisdell, C.C., Stability and instability for dynamic equations on time scales (2005) Computers and Mathematics with Applications, 49 (9-10), pp. 1327-1334. , DOI 10.1016/j.camwa.2005.01.016, PII S0898122105001525; Xu, Y., Xu, Z., Oscillation criteria for two-dimensional dynamic systems on time scales (2009) Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics, 225, pp. 9-19; Sae-Jie, W., Bunwong, K., Numerical verification of certain oscillation results on time scales (2009) Neural, Parallel & Scientific Computations, 17, pp. 317-338; Bohner, M., Peterson, A., (2001) Dynamic Equations on Time Scales: An Introduction with Applications, , Rensselaer, NY: Birkhäuser; Atici, F.M., Biles, D.C., Lebedinsky, A., An application of time scales to economics (2006) Mathematical and Computer Modelling, 43, pp. 718-726; Siming, Z., Yanhui, L., Zhixin, R., Region qualitative analysis of predator-prey system on time scales (2008) Ann. of Diff.

The model is formulated as a continuous time Markov process, which is decomposed into a deterministic dynamics together with stochastic corrections, by using an expansion in inverse system size. The forcing induces a limit cycle in the deterministic dynamics, and a complete analysis of the fluctuations about this time-dependent solution is given. This analysis is applied when the limit cycle is annual, and after a period doubling when it is biennial. The comprehensive nature of our approach allows us to give a coherent picture of the dynamics which unifies past work, but which also provides a systematic method for predicting the periods of oscillations seen in whooping cough and measles epidemics. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Measles; Non-linear dynamics; Period doubling","computer simulation; epidemic; Markov chain; measles; methodology; nonlinearity; numerical model; prediction; seasonal variation; stochasticity; time dependent behavior; article; computer simulation; controlled study; epidemic; immigration; infection rate; mathematical computing; measles; pertussis; population size; prediction; priority journal; seasonal variation; stochastic model; time series analysis; Disease Outbreaks; Epidemics; Humans; Markov Chains; Measles; Models, Biological; Seasons; Whooping Cough","Alonso, D., McKane, A.J., Pascual, M., Stochastic amplification in epidemics (2007) J.

In these models, finite populations of size N are situated at the sites of the integer lattice, and infectious contacts are limited to individuals at the same or at neighboring sites. Susceptible individuals, once infected, remain contagious for one unit of time and then recover, after which they are immune to further infection. It is shown that the measure-valued processes associated with these epidemics, suitably scaled, converge, in the large-N limit, either to a standard Dawson-Watanabe process (super-Brownian motion) or to a Dawson-Watanabe process with location-dependent killing, depending on the size of the the initially infected set. A key element of the argument is a proof of Adler's 1993 conjecture that the local time processes associated with branching random walks converge to the local time density process associated with the limiting super-Brownian motion. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.","Branching random walk; Critical scaling; Dawson-Watanabe process; Local times; Spatial epidemic",,"Aldous, D., Brownian excursions, critical random graphs and the multiplicative coalescent (1997) Ann.

Despite the large number of studies on influenza A virus in waterbirds, little is still known about the transmission dynamics, including prevalence, behavior, and spread of these viruses in the wild waterbird population. From January to April 2006, the HPAI H5N1 virus was confirmed in 82 dead wild waterbirds at the shores of Lake Constance. In this study, we present simple mathematical models to examine this outbreak and to investigate the transmission dynamics of HPAI in wild waterbirds. The population dynamics model of wintering birds was best represented by a sinusoidal function. This model was considered the most adequate to represent the susceptible compartment of the SIR model. The three transmission models predict a basic reproduction ratio (R 0) with value of approximately 1.6, indicating a small epidemic, which ended with the migration of susceptible wild waterbirds at the end of the winter. With this study, we quantify for the first time the transmission of HPAI H5N1 virus at Lake Constance during the outbreak of winter 2005-2006. It is a step toward the improvement of the knowledge of transmission of the virus among wild waterbirds. © 2010 The Author(s).","avian influenza; H5N1; Lake Constance; mathematical modeling; wild waterbirds","Animalia;

A variety of theoretical models have been presented by many authors. Examples are SIR, SIS, SIRS models. By the use of these models, both effects of prevention and quarantine have been explored for the suppression of disease. Here, the term ""prevention"" denotes that the susceptible person behaves not to be infected; examples are vaccination and preventable behaviors. In contrast, we use the term ""quarantine"" as the decrease of infection opportunity; if people avoid the interactions, the infection will be reduced. In the present paper, we study the SIS model on a square lattice: It is called ""contact process"" or ""lattice logistic model."" The contact process has been extensively investigated by many fields, such as mathematics, physics and ecology. Each lattice site takes one of three states: susceptible (S), infected (I) and prevention (P) sites. Infection is assumed to occur between S and I at adjacent sites: no infection occurs for P. To explore both effects of prevention and quarantine, we apply the site and bond percolations respectively. Computer simulations reveal that the system evolves into an equilibrium state. When the infection rate &βετα; increases, or when the recovering rate &γαμμα; decreases, then the equilibrium density of I increases. The final equilibrium state becomes either infectious or disease-free phase. The boundary between both phases can be represented by a scaling law. The mean-field theory well predicts such infection dynamics and the scaling law. However, the theory never predicts the following ""percolation thresholds"": When both levels of prevention and quarantine exceed a threshold (percolation threshold), the disease is effectively suppressed irrespective of the values of &βετα; and &γαμμα;. The percolation means the spatial connection of protected people which cooperatively prohibits the infection.","Percolation threshold; Prevention; Quarantine; Scaling law; SIS model","Adjacent sites; Bond percolation; Contact process; Equilibrium density; Equilibrium state; Infection dynamics; Infection rates; Lattice sites; Logistic models; Percolation thresholds; Prevention; Quarantine; SIS model; Square lattices; Temporal dynamics; Theoretical models; Computer simulation; Crystal lattices; Disease control; Dynamics; Mean field theory; Percolation (computer storage); Percolation (fluids); Percolation (solid state); Scaling laws; Solvents; Mathematical models","Harris, T.E., Contact interaction on a lattice (1974) Ann.

The threat of novel emergent pathogens in human and animal hosts implies the requirement for methods that can robustly estimate epidemiological parameters and provide forecasts. Here, a technique called variational data assimilation is introduced as a means of optimally melding dynamic epidemic models with epidemiological observations and data to provide forecasts and parameter estimates. Using data from a simulated epidemic process the method is used to estimate the start time of an epidemic, to provide a forecast of future epidemic behaviour and estimate the basic reproductive ratio. A feature of the method is that it uses a basic continuous-time SIR model, which is often the first point of departure for epidemiological modelling during the early stages of an outbreak. The method is illustrated by application to data gathered during an outbreak of influenza in a school environment. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Amongst several factors, one that needs attention is the attitude by individuals in not completing malaria treatment thereby lowering their recovery rate and staying longer as infectious individuals. A Susceptible Exposed Infectious (SEI) differential equation model is used to explore the behaviour of the disease with variable host (human) and vector (mosquito) populations based on published data from Cameroon. With a base set of parameters, the basic reproductive number, R0, is computed and the model realistically reproduces endemic stable equilibrium and show that R0 is high when the recovery rate is low. Moreover, when the contact rates between mosquitoes and humans are relatively high, a reduction in the recovery rate from 0.0014 to 0.0056, a value much less than clinically observed recovery rates, resulted in an 80% reduction in the stable endemic proportion of infectious human, a 71.4% reduction in the maximum proportion of infectious humans, and a 52.2% reduction in the stable endemic proportions of infectious mosquitoes. This information suggests that if local communities greatly increase their efforts in educating and informing the public of the risks involved in not completing malaria treatment, and the benefits of completing malaria treatment, a significant impact can be made in controlling the disease. Further results indicate that control measures designed to target the contact rates between mosquitoes and humans will be more efficient at reducingR0 and hence initial disease transmission, and also reduce the endemic infectious steady state human proportion. On the other hand, control measures designed to target the recovery rate will be more efficient at reducing the maximum proportion of infectious individuals, and for areas with very high contact rates and very low recovery rates, it will be more efficient at reducing the endemic infectious steady state human proportion. Hence in an endemic region as Cameroon, the results obtained signify that a good strategy for control, from the perspective of individuals and local communities, should include a combination of education; enforcement of the completion of malaria treatment; use of prescribed non-resistant efficient drugs; reduction of contacts between mosquitoes and humans via the use of insecticide-treated bed nets and the use of mosquito repellent that are safe to use on humans; and reduction of the mosquito recruitment rate by minimizing breeding sites around living areas. © 2009 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Model parameters are cast as simple allometric functions of host body size. Via nonlinear analysis, we investigate the dynamical behavior of the disease for different levels of seasonality in the transmission rate and for different values of the pathogen basic reproduction number (R0) over a broad range of body sizes. While the unforced SEI model exhibits long-term epizootic cycles only for large values of R0, the seasonal model exhibits multiyear periodicity for small values of R0. The oscillation period predicted by the seasonal model is consistent with those observed in the field for different host species. These conclusions are not affected by alternative assumptions for the shape of seasonality or for the parameters that exhibit seasonal variations. However, the introduction of host immunity (which occurs for rabies in some species and is typical of many other wildlife diseases) significantly modifies the epidemic dynamics; in this case, multiyear cycling requires a large level of seasonal forcing. Our analysis suggests that the explicit inclusion of periodic forcing in models of wildlife disease may be crucial to correctly describe the epidemics of wildlife that live in strongly seasonal environments. © 2008 by The University of Chicago.

This contribution compares different approaches for introducing spatial patterns into these dynamics. The applied techniques cover lattice gas cellular automata (LGCA), stochastic cellular automata (SCA) and partial differential equations (PDE). Even though these methods involve distinct types of spatial interaction, it can be shown, that consistent qualitative and quantitative model behaviour can be obtained by means of parameter adaptions and slight technical modifications. These modifications are motivated by stochastic analysis of distributed interaction (PDE, SCA) and diffusion dynamics (LGCA) as well as prevailing physical analogies. The law of large numbers permits to approximate stochastic contacts by distributed interaction. Diffusion of particles can be approximated through empiric adjustment of a Gaussian diffusion distribution. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Recent studies using SI models without acquired immunity have demonstrated that predation can suppress infectious disease levels. The authors recently showed that incorporating immunity (SIR models) can produce a ""hump""-shaped relationship between disease prevalence and predation pressure; thus, low to moderate levels of predation can boost prevalence in hosts with acquired immunity. Here we examine the robustness of this pattern to realistic extensions of a basic SIR model, including density-dependent host regulation, predator saturation, interference, frequency-dependent transmission, predator numerical responses, and explicit resource dynamics. A non-monotonic relationship between disease prevalence and predation pressure holds across all these scenarios. With saturation, there can also be complex responses of mean host abundance to increasing predation, as well as bifurcations leading to unstable cycles (epidemics) and pathogen extinction at larger predator numbers. Firm predictions about the relationship between prevalence and predation thus require one to consider the complex interplay of acquired immunity, host regulation, and foraging behavior of the predator. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Our target is to investigate the long term behaviour of the system in response to changes in β1, the amplitude parameter of the seasonal contact rate, which is our bifurcation parameter. This amplitude parameter is used as a filter to plot the length in years of the period of the stable endemic periodic solution of the SEIR model. Another main aim of this simulation study is to explain how can the type of the contact rate affect the behaviour of the disease dynamics. The simulation results have indicated that using different functional forms of seasonally varying contact rate generates different patterns of solutions for each disease parameter set and type of contact rate. So prediction of the type of disease outbreaks depends on the form of contact rate. Thus it is important to determine which type of contact rate is more likely to match the actual dynamics of each disease. Also these results have shown how the dynamics of the disease depend on the amplitude of the seasonally varying contact rate. Apart from some of the results for measles with a sinusoidal periodic function the simulation results are original and give a clear and a much broader insight into the features of the dynamics of these diseases [D.

Research has to date rather focused on producing predictions for certain localities or under specific conditions, than on designing a publicly available planning tool which can be applied by public health administrations. Here, we provide such a tool which is reproducible by an explicitly formulated structure and designed to operate with an optimal combination of the competing requirements of precision, realism and generality. Results: InfluSim is a deterministic compartment model based on a system of over 1,000 differential equations which extend the classic SEIR model by clinical and demographic parameters relevant for pandemic preparedness planning. It allows for producing time courses and cumulative numbers of influenza cases, outpatient visits, applied antiviral treatment doses, hospitalizations, deaths and work days lost due to sickness, all of which may be associated with economic aspects. The software is programmed in Java, operates platform independent and can be executed on regular desktop computers. Conclusion: InfluSim is a n online available software http://www.influsim.info which efficiently assists public health planners in designing optimal interventions against pandemic influenza. It can reproduce the infection dynamics of pandemic influenza like complex computer simulations while offering at the same time reproducibility, higher computational performance and better operability. © 2007 Eichner et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"antivirus agent; absenteeism; accuracy; article; computer model; computer program; computer simulation; death; demography; hospitalization; human; influenza; Internet","Mounier-Jack, S., Coker, R.J., How prepared is Europe for pandemic influenza?

These models are the standard SIR and SEIR models with time-varying periodic contact rate. The importance of the latent period is our target. When the latent period can be ignored and when it must be taken into account are the main points of our simulation. The comparison of the simulation results of our two models shows that the latent period is affecting the pattern of the dynamics of the disease. This paper addresses how model predictions are affected by the assumed form of the seasonally varying transmission rate and whether or not a latent class is included. Moreover, for some infectious diseases, using latent period leads to appearance or disappearance of some periodic solutions for the same parameter set. A key parameter for our models is the basic reproductive number R0. We have simulated our models for a set of values of parameters insuring that R0 &gt; 1, which represent the endemic case (Greenhalgh and Moneim, 2003; Moneim and Greenhalgh, 2005a,b). Different patterns have been obtained for each of the SIR or SEIR; these patterns are representing the filtered results of the long-term behaviour of the endemic periodic solution for a range of amplitude parameter values of the periodic contact rate. So it is too important to determine which type of model SIR or SEIR is more likely to describe the actual nature of the dynamics of each disease. © 2007 Oxford University Press.","Bifurcation; Epidemics; Filter; Periodicity; Poincaré; Section; SEIR; Simulation; SIR","article; chickenpox; controlled study; endemic disease; epidemic; human; intermethod comparison; mathematical model; measles; mumps; prediction; rubella; seasonal variation; simulation; virus infection; virus transmission; Algorithms; Chickenpox; Communicable Diseases; Computer Simulation; Endemic Diseases; Humans; Measles; Models, Biological; Mumps; Rubella; Seasons","Anderson, R.M., May, R.M., (1991) Infectious Diseases of Humans: Dynamics and Control, , Oxford: Oxford University Press; Aron, J.L., Schwartz, I., Seasonality and period-doubling bifurcations in an epidemic model (1984) J.

Here, we present a method for estimating balanced simultaneous confidence sets for the mean sample path of a stochastic SIR model, thus providing a simple representation of both the typical behavior and the variability of the epidemic. The confidence sets are estimated by a bootstrap procedure, using asymptotic properties of density dependent jump Markov processes. The method is applied to chickenpox epidemics in France and the coverage probability of the confidence sets is estimated in that context.","Bootstrap; Chickenpox; Confidence sets; SIR models; Stochastic models",,,"Commun.

Improving over the classical SIR approach, we introduce a fourth class (C) for the cross-immune individuals in the population, i.e., those that recovered after being infected by different strains of the same viral subtype in the past years. The SIRC model predicts that the prevalence of a virus is maximum for an intermediate value of R0, the basic reproduction number. Via a bifurcation analysis of the model, we discuss the effect of seasonality on the epidemiological regimes. For realistic parameter values, the model exhibits a rich variety of behaviors, including chaos and multi-stable periodic outbreaks. Comparison with empirical evidence shows that the simulated regimes are qualitatively and quantitatively consistent with reality, both for tropical and temperate countries. We find that the basins of attraction of coexisting cycles can be fractal sets, thus predictability can in some cases become problematic even theoretically. In accordance with previous studies, we find that increasing cross-immunity tends to complicate the dynamics of the system. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

They often provide insights into model behaviour and help validate simulation results. However, existing closure schemes typically fail in situations where the population distribution is highly skewed or extinctions occur. In this study we address these problems by introducing novel second- and third-order moment closure approximations which we apply to the stochastic SI and SIS epidemic models. In the case of the SI model, which has a highly skewed distribution of infection, we develop a second-order approximation based on the beta-binomial distribution. In addition, a closure approximation based on mixture distribution is developed in order to capture the behaviour of the stochastic SIS model around the threshold between persistence and extinction. This mixture approximation comprises a probability distribution designed to capture the quasi-equilibrium probabilities of the system and a probability mass at 0 which represents the probability of extinction. Two third-order versions of this mixture approximation are considered in which the log-normal and the beta-binomial are used to model the quasi-equilibrium distribution. Comparison with simulation results shows: (1) the beta-binomial approximation is flexible in shape and matches the skewness predicted by simulation as shown by the stochastic SI model and (2) mixture approximations are able to predict transient and extinction behaviour as shown by the stochastic SIS model, in marked contrast with existing approaches. We also apply our mixture approximation to approximate a likelihood function and carry out point and interval parameter estimation. © 2004 Society for Mathematical Biology. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

It is important both for predicting the future of the present outbreak and for implementing effective prophylactic measures, to identify the causes of this behavior. Results: In this report, we show first that the standard Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) model cannot account for the patterns observed in various regions where the disease spread. We develop a model involving two superimposed epidemics to study the recent spread of the SARS in Hong Kong and in the region. We explore the situation where these epidemics may be caused either by a virus and one or several mutants that changed its tropism, or by two unrelated viruses. This has important consequences for the future: the innocuous epidemic might still be there and generate, from time to time, variants that would have properties similar to those of SARS. Conclusion: We find that, in order to reconcile the existing data and the spread of the disease, it is convenient to suggest that a first milder outbreak protected against the SARS. Regions that had not seen the first epidemic, or that were affected simultaneously with the SARS suffered much more, with a very high percentage of persons affected. We also find regions where the data appear to be inconsistent, suggesting that they are incomplete or do not reflect an appropriate identification of SARS patients. Finally, we could, within the framework of the model, fix limits to the future development of the epidemic, allowing us to identify landmarks that may be useful to set up a monitoring system to follow the evolution of the epidemic. The model also suggests that there might exist a SARS precursor in a large reservoir, prompting for implementation of precautionary measures when the weather cools down. © 2003 Ng et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"analytical parameters; article; China; epidemic; Hong Kong; human; mutant; population research; prevalence; SARS coronavirus; severe acute respiratory syndrome; statistical analysis; statistical model; strain difference; virus mutation","Rasschaert, D., Duarte, M., Laude, H., Porcine respiratory coronavirus differs from transmissible gastroenteritis virus by a few genomic deletions (1990) J.

The model considers the society as a system of individual sexuated agents that can be organized in couples and interact with each other. The different social behaviors are incorporated assigning what we call a promiscuity value to each individual agent. The individual promiscuity is taken from a distribution and represents the daily probability of going out to look for a sexual partner, abandoning its eventual mate. In terms of this parameter we find a threshold for the epidemic which is much lower than the classical SIR model prediction, i.e., R0 (basic reproductive number)=1. Different forms for the distribution of the population promiscuity are considered showing that the threshold is weakly sensitive to them. We study the homosexual and the heterosexual case as well. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

The classical hawk-dove game is used to describe interactions between individuals on a fast time scale (the day). Individuals may exhibit both tactics according to their own experience, to environment conditions, and to the opponent. They are not able to recognize the epidemiological state of their opponents. This fast-time part of the model is coupled to a classical compartmental epidemic model describing the demography of the population and the transmission of the disease from an infected individual to a healthy one on a slow time scale (the year). The model is applied to the case of feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV)-domestic cat population system. Our model gives rise to different predictions according to values of cost and gain due to fights: extinction of the epidemic, FIV endemicity at low, intermediate and high prevalence. These predictions are in good agreement with results from domestic cat populations living in different environmental conditions. © 2003 Elsevier Science (USA).

An important development has been the increasing interest in spatially explicit models, which require more advanced analytical techniques than the usual mean-field or mass-action approaches. The general principle is the derivation of differential equations describing the evolution of the expected population size and other statistics. As a result of spatial interactions no closed set of equations is obtained. Nevertheless, approximate solutions are possible using closure relations for truncation. Here we review and report recent progress on closure approximations applicable to lattice models with nearest-neighbour interactions, including cluster approximations and elaborations on the pair (or pairwise) approximation. This study is made in the context of an SIS model for plant-disease epidemics introduced in Filipe and Gibson (1998, Studying and approximating spatio-temporal models for epidemic spread and control, Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B 353, 21532162) of which the contact process [Harris, T. E. (1974), Contact interactions on a lattice, Ann. Prob. 2, 969] is a special case. The various methods of approximation are derived and explained and their predictions are compared and tested against simulation. The merits and limitations of the various approximations are discussed. A hybrid pairwise approximation is shown to provide the best predictions of transient and long-term, stationary behaviour over the whole parameter range of the model. © 2001 Society for Mathematical Biology.",,"agriculture; analytic method; article; biological model; cluster analysis; comparative study; ecology; epidemic; epidemiology; hybrid; statistical model; statistics","Ben Avraham, D., Kohler, J., Mean-field (N,M)-cluster approximation for lattice models (1992) Phys.

Street Road, Kennett Square, PA 19348, United States","A mathematical model for infection with bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) was created comprising a series of coupled differential equations. The model architecture is a development of the traditional model framework using susceptible, infectious and removed animals (the SIR model). The model predicts 1.2% persistent infection (within the range of field estimates) and is fairly insensitive to alterations of structure or parameter values. This model allows us to draw important conclusions regarding the control of BVD, particularly with respect to the importance of persistently infected (PI) animals in maintaining BVD as an endemic entity in the herd. Herds without PI animals are likely to experience episodic reproductive losses at intervals of two to three years, unlike herds with PI animals which will not see such marked episodic manifestations of infection. Instead, these herds will experience an initial peak of disease which will settle to low-level chronic reproductive losses. The model indicates that vaccine coverage for herd immunity (to avoid episodic manifestations of disease) need be only 57% without PI animals, although 97% coverage is required when PI animals are present. Analysis of model behavior suggests a program of detection and removal of PI animals may enhance the effectiveness of a vaccine program provided these animals are in the herd for 10 days or less. The best results would be seen with PI animals in the herd for 5 or fewer days. © 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.","Bovine viral diarrhea virus; Cattle - microbiological diseases; Eradication programs; Modelling; Test and removal; Vaccination","animal; animal disease; article; biological model; birth rate; cattle; cattle disease; dairying; disease predisposition; disease transmission; epidemic; fertility; standard; time; vaccination; Animals; Birth Rate; Bovine Virus Diarrhea-Mucosal Disease; Cattle; Dairying; Disease Outbreaks; Disease Susceptibility; Fertility; Models, Biological; Time Factors; Vaccination","Alenius, S., Larsson, B., Olsson, S.-O., Jakobsson, L., Elvander, M., A voluntary control programme in Sweden against bovine virus diarrhea virus (BVD) infections in cattle (1994) Proc. 18th World Buiatrics Congress, pp. 741-742. , Bologna, Italy; Ames, T.R., The causative agent of BVD: Its epidemiology and pathogenesis (1986) Vet.

Mathematical models used in the past (such as the SEIR model with seasonal forcing) have been able to predict the onset of both periodic and chaotic sustained epidemics using parameters of childhood diseases. Although these models possess stable solutions which appear to have the correct frequency content, the corresponding outbreaks require extremely large populations to support the epidemic. This paper shows that by relaxing the assumption of uniformity in the supply of susceptibles, simple models predict stable long period oscillatory epidemics having small amplitude. Both coupled and single population models are considered. © 1992, Springer-Verlag.

Populations of both host and vector are divided into compartments representing disease status (susceptible, exposed, infectious, and, for humans, resistant), and the flow between compartments is described by differential equations. Examination of the equilibrium points leads to a formulation of the basic reproduction rate (z0) of the disease. With a base set of parameters, z0 = 1.9 and the model realistically reproduces epidemic transmission in an immunologically naive population. Control of adult mosquitoes by ultra-low volume (ULV) aerosols is simulated by an abrupt decrease in vector densities, followed by gradual recovery of the vector population. The model indicates that ULV has little impact on disease incidence, even when multiple applications are made, although the peak of the epidemic may be delayed. Decreasing the carrying capacity of the environment for mosquitoes, and thus the basic reproduction rate of the disease, by source reduction or other means, is more effective in reducing transmission.",,"insecticide; Aedes aegypti; article; dengue; Dengue virus; disease severity; epidemic; host susceptibility; insecticide resistance; population exposure; prevalence; priority journal; vector control; virus transmission",,"AM.

The model is shown to exhibit bistable behavior for a fixed set of parameters. Basins of attraction for each recurrent outbreak are computed, and it is shown that the basins of two coexisting stable outbreaks are intertwined in a complicated manner. The effect of such a basin structure is shown to result in an obstruction in predicting asymptotically the type of outbreak given an uncertainty in the initial population of susceptibles and infectives. © 1985 Springer-Verlag.","Bistability; forced nonlinear differential equations; measles, epidemics, predictability","epidemiology; human; measles; methodology; nonbiological model; statistics; Epidemiology; Human; Mathematics; Models, Biological; Seasons","Anderson, R.M., May, R.M., Directly transmitted infectious diseases: Control by vaccination (1982) Science, 215, pp. 1053-1054; Aron, J., Schwartz, I., Seasonality and period-doubling bifurcations in an epidemic model (1984) J.
