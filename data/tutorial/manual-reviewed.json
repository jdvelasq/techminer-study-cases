The on-going research on noise elimination in time series forecasting has led to a successful approach of decomposing the data sequence into component trends to identify noise-inducing information. The empirical mode decomposition method separates the time series\/signal into a set of intrinsic mode functions ranging from high to low frequencies, which can be summed up to reconstruct the original data. The usual assumption that random noises are only contained in the high-frequency component has been shown not to be the case, as observed in our previous findings. The results from that experiment reveal that noise can be present in a low frequency component, and this motivates the newly-proposed algorithm. Additionally, to prevent the erosion of periodic trends and patterns within the series, we perform the learning of local and global trends separately in a hierarchical manner which succeeds in detecting and eliminating short\/long term noise. The algorithm is tested on four datasets from financial market data and physical science data. The simulation results are compared with the conventional and state-of-the-art approaches for time series machine learning, such as the non-linear autoregressive neural network and the long short-term memory recurrent neural network, respectively. Statistically significant performance gains are recorded when the meta-learning algorithm for noise reduction is used in combination with these artificial neural networks. For time series data which cannot be decomposed into meaningful trends, applying the moving average method to create meta-information for guiding the learning process is still better than the traditional approach. Therefore, this new approach is applicable to the forecasting of time series with a low signal to noise ratio, with a potential to scale adequately in a multi-cluster system due to the parallelized nature of the algorithm. \u00a9 2017 by the authors.","SELECTED":true}

Jump is an important behavior in financial time series, since it implies a change in volatility. Ones can buy the volatility instrument if ones expect the volatility will bloom up in the future. A jump detection model attempts to detect short-term market instability, since it could be jumping up or down, instead of a directional prediction. The directional prediction can be considered as a momentum or trend following, which is not the focus of this paper. A jump detection model is commonly applied in a systematic fast-moving strategy, which reallocates the assets automatically. Also, a systematic opening position protection strategy can be driven by a jump detection model. For example, for a tail risk protection strategy, a pair of long call and put option order could be placed in the same time, in order to protect the open position given a huge change in volatility. One of the key differentiations of the proposed model with the classical methods of time-series anomaly detection is that, jump threshold parameters are not required to be predefined in our proposed model. Also the model is a combination of a Long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network model and a machine learning pattern recognition model. The LSTM model is applied for time series prediction, which predicts the next data point. The historical prediction errors sequence can be used as the information source or input of the jump detection model\/module. The machine learning pattern recognition model is applied for jump detection. The combined model attempts to determine whether the current data point is a jump or not. LSTM neural network is a type of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). LSTM records not only the recent market, but also the historical status. A stacked RNN is trained on a dataset which is mixed with normal and anomalous data. We compare the performance of the proposed Hybrid jump detection model and different pattern classification algorithms, such as k-nearest neighbors algorithm identifier, Hampel identifier, and Lee Mykland test. The model is trained and tested using real financial market data, including 11 global stock market in both developed and emerging markets in US, China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Japan, UK, German, and Israel. The experiment result shows that the proposed Hybrid jump detection model is effective to detect jumps in terms of accuracy, comparing to the other classical jump detection methods. \u00a9 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","SELECTED":true}

Recently, the deep neural network is popularly applied in this area of research; however, it is prone to overfitting owing to limited availability of data points for training. We propose a novel data augmentation approach for stock market index forecasting through our ModAugNet framework, which consists of two modules: an overfitting prevention LSTM module and a prediction LSTM module. The performance of the proposed model is evaluated using two different representative stock market data (S&P500 and Korea Composite Stock Price Index 200 (KOSPI200)). The results confirm the excellent forecasting accuracy of the proposed model. ModAugNet-c yields a lower test error than the comparative model (SingleNet) in which an overfitting prevention LSTM module is absent. The test mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and mean absolute error (MAE) for S&P500 decreased to 54.1%, 35.5%, and 32.7%, respectively, of the corresponding S&P500 forecasting errors of SingleNet, while the same for KOSPI200 decreased to 48%, 23.9%, and 32.7%, respectively, of the corresponding KOSPI200 forecasting errors of SingleNet. Furthermore, through the analyses of the trained ModAugNet-c, we found that test performance is entirely dependent on the prediction LSTM module.

In that, conventional time series analysis often fails to give an accurate forecast for financial processes due to inherent noise patterns, fat tails, and nonlinear components. A recent stream of literature on behavioral finance has revealed that boundedly rational agents using simple rules of thumb for their decisions under uncertainty provides a more realistic description of human behavior than perfect rationality with optimal decision rules. Consequently, the application of technical analysis in trading could produce high returns. Machine learning techniques have been employed in economic systems in modeling nonlinearities and simulating human behavior. In this study, we expand the literature that evaluates return sign forecasting ability by introducing a recurrent neural network approach that combines heuristic learning and short-term memory emulation, thus mimicking the decision-making process of boundedly rational agents.

While temporal relationships in the data exist, they are difficult to analyze and predict accurately due to the non-linear trends and noise present in the series. We propose to learn these dependencies by a convolutional neural network. In particular the focus is on multivariate time series forecasting. Effectively, we use multiple financial time series as input in the neural network, thus conditioning the forecast of a time series x(t) on both its own history as well as that of a second (or third) time series y(t). Training a model on multiple stock series allows the network to exploit the correlation structure between these series so that the network can learn the market dynamics in shorter sequences of data. We show that long-term temporal dependencies in and between financial time series can be learned by means of a deep convolutional neural network based on the WaveNet model [2]. The network makes use of dilated convolutions applied to multiple time series so that the receptive field of the network is wide enough to learn both short and long-term dependencies. The architecture includes batch normalization and uses a 1 \u00d7 k convolution with parametrized skip connections from the input time series as well as the time series we condition on, in this way learning long-term interdependencies in an efficient manner [1]. This improves the forecast, while at the same time limiting the requirement for a long historical price series and reducing the noise. Knowing the strong performance of CNNs on classification problems we show that they can be applied successfully to forecasting financial time series, without the need of large samples of data. We compare the performance of the WaveNet model to a state-of-the-art fully convolutional network (FCN), and an autoregressive model popular in econometrics and show that our model is much better able to learn important dependencies in between financial time series resulting in a more robust and accurate forecast. \u00a9 Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","SELECTED":true}

This paper aims to seek a computationally feasible approach for predicting large scale conditional volatility and covariance of financial time series. In the case of multi-variant time series, the volatility is represented by a Conditional Covariance Matrix (CCM). Traditional models for predicting CCM such as GARCH models are incapable of dealing with high-dimensional cases as there are O(N 2) parameters to be estimated in the case of N-variant asset return, and it is difficult to accelerate the computation of estimating these parameters by utilizing modern multi-core architecture. These GARCH models also have difficulties in modeling non-linear properties.

Historical stock market data from the perspective of time series analysis is also included as an input feature. With the extracted features, we use a support vector machine (SVM) to build the prediction model, with its parameters optimised through particle swarm optimisation (PSO). Experimental results show that our proposed SVM and PSO-based model is able to obtain better results than a deep learning model in terms of time and accuracy. The results presented here are to date the best in the literature based on the financial news dataset tested. This excellent performance is attributed to the sentiment analysis done during the pre-processing stage, as it reduces the feature dimensions significantly. \u00a9 2018 Copyright held by the owner\/author(s).","SELECTED":true}

However, deep learning (DL) on the application of automated financial management has been rarely investigated. Thus, this research focuses on the applications of FinTech and DL in asset allocation and aims to optimize investment portfolio. The best investment portfolio in index-based funds based on Taiwan's index-type security investment trust funds are the main investment targets. Time series models for DL, that is, long short-term memory, predict the increase of each investment target and find the best investment portfolio in combination with the relevant asset allocation theory. In this research, we use the Markowitz mean-variance and Black-Litterman models as our asset allocation models for robo-advisor. Results show that the Black-Litterman model has a better accumulated return performance than the Morkowitz model and outperforms other strategies. The Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) dialogue service adopts artificial intelligence markup language (AIML) and a generative model.

In finance, several of this quantities of interests (stock valuations, return, volatility) have been shown to be mutually influencing each other, making the prediction of such quantities a difficult task, especially while dealing with an high number of variables and multiple horizons in the future. Here we propose a machine learning based framework, the DFML, based on the Dynamic Factor Model, to first perform a dimensionality reduction and then perform a multiple step ahead forecasting of a reduced number of components. Finally, the components are transformed again into an high dimensional space, providing the desired forecast. Our results, comparing the DFML with several state of the art techniques from different domanins (PLS, RNN, LSTM, DFM), on both traditional stock markets and cryptocurrencies market and for different families of volatility proxies show that the DFML outperforms the concurrent methods, especially for longer horizons.

However, this rapid development has led to a major potential risk. A few P2P enterprises operate well in the beginning but close within a short period because of the suspension of business, fraud, illegal fundraising, and blind expansion. Effective supervision of the P2P industry is an urgent problem. Trading volume reflects the operation stability of P2P platforms. Hence, predicting the volume of the P2P market is an important research topic. This paper first analyzes the trading data of a P2P platform. It is found that the sentiment of investor comments is related to the trading volume of the P2P platform. Then, we use the TextCNN model to classify the sentiment of investor comments and obtain the time series of changes in sentiment. It is verified that the time series of change in sentiment and the P2P volume index has statistical causality and a strong correlation. This paper proposes a model that uses the trend of change in investor sentiment to predict P2P trading volume. This model uses the historical time series change in investor sentiment, the P2P volume index, and WeekDay characteristics to predict future P2P trading volume. The experimental results show that the proposed model is better than a few existing baseline methods.

Machine learning methods such as shallow neural networks have higher predictive accuracy than time series models when trained on input features carefully crafted by domain knowledge experts. This suggests that deep neural networks, with their ability to learn abstract features from raw data, may provide improved predictive accuracy with raw exchange rates as inputs. The preponderance of research focuses on developed currency markets. The paucity of research in emerging currency markets, and the crucial role that stable currencies play in such economies, motivates us to investigate the effectiveness of deep networks for exchange rate prediction in emerging markets. Literature suggests that the Efficient Market Hypothesis, which posits that asset prices reflect all relevant information, may not hold in such markets because of extraneous factors such as political instability and governmental interventions. This motivates our hypothesis that inclusion of carefully chosen macroeconomic factors as input features may improve the predictive accuracy of deep networks in emerging currency markets.

This has triggered data to be mined at an even faster pace causing the rise of Data Centers that host over thousands of machines together with thousands of jobs running in each of those machines. The growing complexities associated with managing such a huge infrastructure has caused the scheduling management systems to be inefficient at resource allocation across these machines. Hence, resource usage forecasting of machines in data centers is a growing area for research. This study focuses on the Time Series forecasting of CPU usage of machines in data centers using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Network and evaluating it against the widely used and traditional autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models for forecasting.

To build an abstract representation of a real-world financial market situation, we structure the fundamental influences among homogeneous and heterogeneous markets with three types of correlations: The inner-domain correlation between homogeneous markets in various countries, the cross-domain correlation between heterogeneous markets, and the time-series correlation between current and past markets. Such types of correlations in global finance challenge traditional machine learning approaches due to model complexity and nonlinearity. In this paper, we propose a novel cross-domain deep learning approach (Cd-DLA) to learn real-world complex correlations for multiple financial market prediction. Based on recurrent neural networks, which capture the time-series interactions in financial data, our model utilizes the attention mechanism to analyze the inner-domain and cross-domain correlations, and then aggregates all of them for financial forecasting. Experiment results on ten-year financial data on currency and stock markets from three countries prove the performance of our approach over other baselines. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.","SELECTED":true}

Predicting stock price direction, especially short-term direction, is very challenging and consistently attracts researches. Deep recurrent neural networks, such as Long Short-Term Memory, typically outperform statistical time series models and traditional machine learning approaches with their mechanisms of learning to vectorize historical information. However, encoding entire history into a vector may unavoidably causes information loss regardless of memory learning and updating mechanisms, especially for those tasks where decisions need to be made on the current time point and similar historical time points are of great references to the decision making. In this paper, we propose a new deep architecture called Recurrent Embedding Kernel (REK) that can learn to make optimal decisions by referring to the entire history instead of just current memory vectors.

We first present a comparative study of recurrent neural network models (RNNs), including a simple RNN, long short-term memory (LSTM), and gated recurrent unit. The models are applied to the investment universe consisted of 10 stocks in the S& P500. The experimental results show that the LSTM-based prediction model outperforms the others in terms of hit ratio of 1-month-ahead forecasts. We then build predictive threshold-based portfolios (TBPs) that are subsets of the universe satisfying given threshold criteria for the LSTM-based return forecasts. The TBPs are rebalanced monthly to restore equal weight to the constituents of the TBPs. We find that the risk and return profile of the realized TBP represents a monotonically increasing frontier on the risk\u2013return plane, where the equally weighted universe portfolio plays a role in the lower bound of TBPs. This shows the availability of TBPs in targeting specific risk\u2013return levels, and the EWP of an universe plays a role in the reference portfolio of the TBPs. In the process, thresholds play dominant roles in characterizing risk, return, and the prediction accuracy of the TBPs.

Experiments on real-world stock price datasets demonstrate that the proposed model generates a better volatility estimation and prediction that outperforms mainstream methods, e.g., deterministic models such as GARCH and its variants, and stochastic models namely the MCMC-based stochvol as well as the Gaussian-process-based, on average negative log-likelihood.

Embedded in these big data are useful information and knowledge that can be discovered by machine learning and data mining models, techniques or algorithms. A rich source of big data is stock exchange. The ability to effectively predict future stock prices improves the economic growth and development of a country. Traditional linear approaches for prediction (e.g., Kalman filters) may not be practical in handling big data like stock prices due to highly nonlinear and chaotic nature. This lead to the exploitation of various nonlinear estimators such as the extended Kalman filters, expert systems, and various neural network architectures. Moreover, to lessen the potential shortcomings of individual algorithms, ensemble approaches have been created by averaging values across different algorithms. Existing ensemble techniques mostly basket-together a collection of sample-based algorithms that are catered to nonlinear functions. To the best of our knowledge, traditional linear estimators have not yet been incorporated into such an ensemble. Hence, in this paper, we propose a machine learning (specifically, token-based ensemble) algorithm that utilizes both linear and nonlinear estimators to predict big financial time-series data. Our ensemble consists of a traditional Kalman filter, long short-term memory (LSTM) network, and the traditional linear regression model. We also explore the adaptive properties in short-term high-risk trading in the presence of noisy data like stock prices and demonstrate the performance of our ensemble. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.","SELECTED":true}

For example, company earnings are calculated from total revenue minus total costs and each variable can be further decomposed into several accounting items. This property leads to a relatively new research problem. When the dependent variable for prediction has a hierarchical structure, which level of aggregation may be the optimal choice for prediction? Is it possible to use the information from the predictions of all component variables to enhance the prediction accuracy of the focal variable of interests? To solve this problem, this paper designs a novel forecasting method-Hierarchical Stacking of LSTM (HSL)-by using various data mining techniques. Our proposed solution consists of two stages. In the first phase, by LSTM-RNN, the proposed method makes predictions of the dependent variable given different candidate decompositions. Meanwhile, we devise a method creative use of Genetic algorithm to search for the top-performing decompositions of the dependent variable. In the second stage, the ensemble learning method by Stacking is applied to aggregate several predictions from top-performing decompositions.

Experimental results show that the two GRU models proposed in this paper both obtain higher prediction accuracy on these data sets, and the improved version can effectively improve the learning ability of the model. \u00a9 2018 The Authors.

Unfortunately, there is a significant gap in the real-world deployment of this breakthrough. For example, professional traders in their long-term careers have accumulated numerous trading rules, the myth of which they can understand quite well. On the other hand, deep learning models have been hardly interpretable. This paper presents DeepClue, a system built to bridge text-based deep learning models and end users through visually interpreting the key factors learned in the stock price prediction model. We make three contributions in DeepClue. First, by designing the deep neural network architecture for interpretation and applying an algorithm to extract relevant predictive factors, we provide a useful case on what can be interpreted out of the prediction model for end users. Second, by exploring hierarchies over the extracted factors and displaying these factors in an interactive, hierarchical visualization interface, we shed light on how to effectively communicate the interpreted model to end users. Specially, the interpretation separates the predictables from the unpredictables for stock prediction through the use of intercept model parameters and a risk visualization design. Third, we evaluate the integrated visualization system through two case studies in predicting the stock price with financial news and company-related tweets from social media. Quantitative experiments comparing the proposed neural network architecture with state-of-the-art models and the human baseline are conducted and reported. Feedbacks from an informal user study with domain experts are summarized and discussed in details. The study results demonstrate the effectiveness of DeepClue in helping to complete stock market investment and analysis tasks. \u00a9 1989-2012 IEEE.","SELECTED":true}

Traditionally, there are several techniques to effectively forecast the next lag of time series data such as univariate Autoregressive (AR), univariate Moving Average (MA), Simple Exponential Smoothing (SES), and more notably Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) with its many variations. In particular, ARIMA model has demonstrated its outperformance in precision and accuracy of predicting the next lags of time series. With the recent advancement in computational power of computers and more importantly development of more advanced machine learning algorithms and approaches such as deep learning, new algorithms are developed to analyze and forecast time series data. The research question investigated in this article is that whether and how the newly developed deep learning-based algorithms for forecasting time series data, such as 'Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)', are superior to the traditional algorithms. The empirical studies conducted and reported in this article show that deep learning-based algorithms such as LSTM outperform traditional-based algorithms such as ARIMA model. More specifically, the average reduction in error rates obtained by LSTM was between 84 - 87 percent when compared to ARIMA indicating the superiority of LSTM to ARIMA. Furthermore, it was noticed that the number of training times, known as 'epoch' in deep learning, had no effect on the performance of the trained forecast model and it exhibited a truly random behavior. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.","SELECTED":true}

This is a step toward making informed\/explainable decisions in the domain of time series, powered by deep learning. There have been numerous efforts to increase the interpretability of image-centric deep neural network models, where the learned features are more intuitive to visualize. Visualization in the domain of time series is significantly challenging, as there is no direct interpretation of the filters and inputs compared with the imaging modality. In addition, a little or no concentration has been devoted to the development of such tools in the domain of time series in the past. TSViz provides possibilities to explore and analyze the network from different dimensions at different levels of abstraction, which includes the identification of the parts of the input that were responsible for a particular prediction (including per filter saliency), importance of the different filters present in the network, notion of diversity present in the network through filter clustering, understanding of the main sources of variation learned by the network through inverse optimization, and analysis of the network's robustness against adversarial noise. As a sanity check for the computed influence values, we demonstrate our results on pruning of neural networks based on the computed influence information. These representations allow the user to better understand the network so that the acceptability of these deep models for time-series analysis can be enhanced. This is extremely important in domains, such as finance, industry 4.0, self-driving cars, health care, and counter-terrorism, where reasons for reaching a particular prediction are equally important as the prediction itself.

The universal price formation model exhibits a remarkably stable out-of-sample accuracy across a wide range of stocks and time periods. Interestingly, these results also hold for stocks which are not part of the training sample, showing that the relations captured by the model are universal and not asset-specific. The universal model\u2014trained on data from all stocks\u2014outperforms asset-specific models trained on time series of any given stock. This weighs in favor of pooling together financial data from various stocks, rather than designing asset- or sector-specific models, as is currently commonly done. Standard data normalizations based on volatility, price level or average spread, or partitioning the training data into sectors or categories such as large\/small tick stocks, do not improve training results.

However, introducing explicit knowledge as exogenous variables has received little attention. In this paper, we propose a novel model termed sentiment-aware volatility forecasting (SAVING), which incorporates market sentiment for stock return fluctuation prediction. Our framework provides an ensemble of symbolic and sub-symbolic AI approaches, that is, including grounded knowledge into a connectionist neural network. The model aims at producing a more accurate estimation of temporal variances of asset returns by better capturing the bi-directional interaction between movements of asset price and market sentiment. The interaction is modeled using Variational Bayes via the data generation and inference operations. We benchmark our model with 9 other popular ones in terms of the likelihood of forecasts given the observed sequence. Experimental results suggest that our model not only outperforms pure statistical models, e.g., GARCH and its variants, Gaussian-process volatility model, but also outperforms the state-of-the-art autoregressive deep neural nets architectures, such as the variational recurrent neural network and the neural stochastic volatility model. \u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.","SELECTED":true}

In practical applications, different indicator features have significant impact when predicting stock index. In addition, different technical indicators which contained in the same matrix will interfere with each other when convolutional neural network (CNN) is applied to feature extraction. To solve the above problem, this paper suggests a multi-indicator feature selection for stock index prediction based on a multi-channel CNN structure, named MI-CNN framework. In this method, candidate indicators are selected by maximal information coefficient feature selection (MICFS) approach, to ensure the correlation with stock movements while reduce redundancy between different indicators. Then an effective CNN structure without sub-sampling is designed to extract abstract features of each indicator, avoiding mutual interference between different indicators.

When institutions lack adequate cash flow for customer redemption, their income will decrease, their reputation will be affected, and they may even go bankrupt. However, the opposite extreme in which more cash is reserved than needed may result in lost opportunities to make successful investments. This study uses Yu'e Bao transaction data to investigate a method for forecasting financial capital flow. Yu'e Bao, which is a financial product launched by Alibaba, faces the core challenge of maximizing commercial profits to reduce investment risks. Liquidity risk is considered the main factor in Yu'e Bao's investment strategy.

In this paper, a deep-learning-based model is proposed to forecast the foreign exchange rate. Since the currency market is volatile and susceptible to ongoing social and political events, the proposed model incorporates event sentiments to accurately predict the exchange rate. Moreover, as the currency market is heavily dependent upon highly volatile factors such as gold and crude oil prices, we considered these sensitive factors for exchange rate forecasting. The validity of the model is tested over three currency exchange rates, which are Pak Rupee to US dollar (PKR\/USD), British pound sterling to US dollar (GBP\/USD), and Hong Kong Dollar to US dollar (HKD\/USD). The study also shows the importance of incorporating investor sentiment of local and foreign macro-level events for accurate forecasting of the exchange rate. We processed approximately 5.9 million tweets to extract major events' sentiment. The results show that this deep-learning-based model is a better predictor of foreign currency exchange rate in comparison with statistical techniques normally employed for prediction.

The problem, however, is that most of these methods is based on daily trading data. When facing the high frequency trading data which is more powerful in short-term forecasting, these methods become incapable. Inspired by the development of Convolutional Neural Network in image recognition tasks, this paper tries to apply the Convolutional Neural Network on the high frequency financial trading data, and has achieved good results. We collect the close price of Shanghai Composite Index from 2006 to 2008 and from 2014 to 2015, about 1000 trading days in total. The frequency of the trading data is 5 min. The paper intends to forecast the stock\u2019s future trend of the next day from historical data, namely, go up or down.

The Hodrick-Prescott filter(decomposition) is a mathematical tool used in macroeconomics to separate the cyclical component ct and trend component \u03c4t from a time series. After preprocessing, the proposed method novelly transforms the time series into pictures. We apply GASF, GADF and MTF algorithm [2] on the time series respectively, forming the R, G and B channels of a picture. By transforming each of the time series into picture mode, the trading time series produces a picture library.

The cycle characteristic is an important factor in time series prediction problem since it affects the trend of stock price. Thus, an effective cycle information can improve the prediction performance of stock price. In past years, many researches use the cycle feature with other features together as equally important, which might dilute the weight of cycle information since the cycle information should be paid more attention when making prediction on periodic data. As the result, we use CEAM making prediction with cycle information hidden in periodic data. The deep learning-based method has been developed in many fields and is a powerful prediction system. In addition, many researches use the embeddings feature and the attention mechanism to improve the prediction performance. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to capture the cycle information and use it to predict stock prices in U.S. stock market. The cycle information can be formed as a distributed vector as embeddings, called cycle embeddings. The CEAM approach use cycle embeddings to pay attention on periodically historical time series data by learning the cycle semantic relations between cycle characteristics and historical stock prices to optimize the prediction model. Therefore, the CEAM approach can improve the prediction performance for stock price.

Because financial data contain complex, incomplete and fuzzy information, predicting their development trends is an extremely difficult challenge.

Typically, Elman neural network is a local recurrent neural network, having one context layer that memorizes the past states, which is quite fit for resolving time series issues. Given this, this paper takes Elman network to predict the opening price of stock market. Considering that Elman network is limited, this paper adopts self-adapting variant PSO algorithm to optimize the weights and thresholds of network. Afterwards, the optimized data, regarded as initial weight and threshold value, is given to Elman network for training, accordingly the prediction model for opening price of stock market based on self-adapting variant PSO-Elman network is formed. Finally, this paper verifies that model by some stock prices, and compares with BP network and Elman network, so as to draw the result that shows the precision and stability of this predication model both are superior to the traditional neural network. \u00a9 2017 IEEE.","SELECTED":true}

However, the results are not quite satisfactory due to stock market's complexity. Many approaches either lack a clear and reasonable definition of trend or neglect the uniqueness of time attribute in stock data, treating them like other attributes, and use one-size-fits-All models to solve such a typical time-series problem. In this paper, we attempted to exploit the time attribute of stock data to improve prediction accuracy. Firstly, instead of treating data indiscriminately, we used time weight function to carefully assign weights to data according to their temporal nearness towards the data to be predicted. Secondly, the stock trend definitions were formally given by referencing financial theories and best practices. Lastly, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network was customized to discover the underlying temporal dependencies in data. The trials of different time-weighted functions showed that the relation between the importance of data and their time-series is not constant. Instead, it falls within linear and quadratic, roughly a quasilinear function. Equipped with the time-weighted function, LSTM outperformed other models and can be generalized to other stock indexes. In the test with CSI 300 index, we achieved 83.91% in accuracy when fed with the redefined trends. \u00a9 2017 IEEE.","SELECTED":true}

Deep belief network (DBN) model of deep learning is a new method of predicting the exchange rate data, and the designing of DBN structure and the learning rules of parameters are the most important parts of DBN model. The paper firstly divides the time series data into training and testing sets. By optimizing the DBN parameters, the paper analyses the results of the training analysis and answers how to do node setting. Then, the paper adjusts the number of hidden nodes, inputs nodes and hidden layers, and by using multiple variance analysis, it determines the sensitive range of the node. Finally, the experiments of INR\/USD and CNY\/USD have proved that compared with the FFNN model, the improved DBN model could better forecast the exchange rate. \u00a9 2017, The Natural Computing Applications Forum.","SELECTED":true}

While the LSTM prediction model has shown promise in anomaly detection in previous research, uncorrelated features can lead to unsatisfactory analysis result and can complicate the prediction model due to the curse of dimensionality. This paper proposes a novel method of clustering and predicting multidimensional aircraft time series. The purpose is to detect anomalies in flight vibration in the form of high dimensional data series, which are collected by dozens of sensors during test flights of large aircraft. The new method is based on calculating the Spearman\u2019s rank correlation coefficient between two series, and on a hierarchical clustering method to cluster related time series. Monotonically similar series are gathered together and each cluster of series is trained to predict independently. Thus series which are uncorrelated or of low relevance do not influence each other in the LSTM prediction model. The experimental results on COMAC\u2019s (Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China Ltd) C919 flight test data show that our method of combining clustering and LSTM model significantly reduces the root mean square error of predicted results. \u00a9 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","SELECTED":true}
{"Title":"Planning purchase decisions with advanced neural networks","Author Keywords":null,"Index Keywords":null,"Abstract":"In this chapter we investigate a typical situation of a corporate treasurer: on an ongoing basis some kind of transaction is performed. This may be a regular monthly investment in equities for a pension plan, or a fixed income placement. It might be a foreign exchange transaction to pay monthly costs in another currency. Or it could be the monthly supply of some commodity, like fuel or metal. All these cases have in common that the treasurer has to choose an appropriate time for the transaction. This is the day on which the price is the most favorable. Ideally, we want to buy at the lowest price within the month, and we also want to invest our money at the highest available interest rate. This problem is complex, because the underlying financial time series are not moving independently. Rather, they are interconnected. In order to truly understand our time series of choice, we have to model other influences as well: equities, currencies, interest rates, commodities, and so on. To achieve this we present a novel recurrent neural network approach: Historically Consistent Neural Networks (HCNN). HCNNs allow to model dynamics of entire markets using a state space equation: st+1=tanh(W\u22c5st). Here, W represents a weight matrix and st the state of our dynamic system at time t. This iterative formulation easily produces multi step forecasts for several time points into the future. We analyze monthly purchasing decisions for a market of 25 financial time series. This market approximates a world market: it includes various asset classes from Europe, the US, and Asia. Our benchmar, an averaging strategy, shows that using HCNNs to forecast an entry point for ongoing investments results in better prices for every time series in the sample. \u00a9 Springer-Verlag London 2013.","SELECTED":true}
