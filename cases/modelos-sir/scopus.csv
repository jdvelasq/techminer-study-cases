Each power spectral density (PSD) indicated exponential decay until it leveled off at a limit determined by the accuracy of the present data. Many spectral lines observed in the PSD could be fully assigned using linear combinations of a few fundamental periods. The optimum least squares fitting curve calculated using these fundamental periods essentially reproduced the underlying variation of disease data and an extension of the curve could be used to predict the incidence of the diseases. The effect of mass vaccinations on measles was quantitatively estimated by analyzing the monthly data from Statistics on Communicable Disease. The periodic modes for seasonal oscillations were also estimated. Some discussions including the chaotic dynamics of data on the outbreak of diseases are presented. The method of analysis was confirmed to be a highly effective in elucidating temporal variations of disease data of short data length.","Chaos; Chickenpox; Epidemiology; Exponential spectrum; Maximum entropy method (MEM); Measles; Mumps; Prediction analysis; Rubella; Time series analysis","Maximum entropy method; Power spectral density; Recurrent epidemics; Chaos theory; Computer aided analysis; Computer software; Curve fitting; Data reduction; Epidemiology; Least squares approximations; Spectrum analysis; Time series analysis; Diseases","Evans, A.L., (1989) Viral Infections of Humans - Epidemiology and Control, , Plenum Medical Book Co., New York, 3rd ed; Anderson, R.M., May, R.M., (1991) Infectious Disease of Humans - Dynamics and Control, , Oxford University Press, London; Levin, S.M., Hallam, T.G., Gross, L.J., (1980) Applied Mathematical Ecology, , Springer-Verlag, New York; Bailey, N.T.J., (1975) The Mathematical Theory of Infectious Disease and Its Applications, , Charles Griffin, New York, 2nd ed; May, R.M., (1991) The New Scientist Guide to Chaos, p. 82. , ed.

The analysis is based on seroepidemiological data of all reported HIV carriers and a number of explaining variables based on individual level register data. Instead of focusing on populations of carriers and susceptibles, emphasis is placed on identifying the primary influences directing the epidemic as a spatial process. This is done by dividing Finland into 62 functional small area units and by assigning the risk of obtaining the virus to each unit based on behavioral, socioeconomic, interaction, and structural characteristics of the population. The approach is a multistep procedure including multivariate regression analysis, the potential model, and time series analysis. The model was used to produce a three-year forecast of the distribution of new HIV carriers in Finland. Compared with earlier studies of similar nature based on the use of administrative regional units, in this paper the forecast distribution of HIV cases is more closely related to the functional structure of the spatial system in Finland. Such an approach offers a method for producing more reliable short-term forecasts of the spatial distribution of new HIV cases. Three different spatial diffusion patterns were identified.",,"disease epidemic; forecasting method; HIV; medical geography; methodological approach; spatial distribution; Finland","Aho, K., Kantanen, M.-L., Cantell, K., Brink, A., Pönk, A., Screening for HIV antibody during pregnancy (1987) Lancet, 333, p. 921; Anderson, R.M., May, R.M., The epidemiological parameters of HIV transmission (1988) Nature, 333, pp. 314-319; Barnett, T., Blaikie, P., (1992) AIDS in Africa, Its Present and Future Impact, , John Wiley & Sons, Chichester; Casetti, E., Fan, C.C., The spatial spread of the AIDS epidemic in Ohio: Empirical analyses using the expansion method (1991) Env Plann A, 23, pp. 1589-1608; Chu, S.Y., Peterman, T.A., Doll, L.S., Buehler, J.W., Curran, J.W., AIDS in bisexual men in the United States: Epidemiology and transmission to women (1992) Am J Public Health, 82, p. 220; Dangelo, L.J., Getson, P.R., Luban, N.L.C., Gayle, H.D., Human immunodeficiency infection in adolescents: Can we predict who is at risk?

The recent analysis undertaken to determine the risk to the population from dorsal route ganglia illustrated the danger in presenting point estimates rather than ranges of scenarios in the face of uncertainty. We present a mathematical template that relates the past pattern of the BSE epidemic in cattle to the future course of any vCJD epidemic in humans, and use extensive scenario analysis to explore the wide range of possible outcomes given the uncertainty in epidemiological determinants. We demonstrate that the average number of humans infected by one infectious bovine and the incubation period distribution are the two epidemiological factors that have the greatest impact on epidemic size and duration. Using the time-series of the BSE epidemic and the cases seen to date, we show that the minimum length of the incubation period is approximately nine years, and that at least 20% of the cases diagnosed to date were exposed prior to 1986. We also demonstrate that the current age distribution of vCJD cases can only arise if younger people were either exposed to a greater extent, more susceptible to infection, or have shorter incubation periods. Extensive scenario analyses show that given the information currently available, the very high degree of uncertainty in the future size of the epidemic will remain for the next 3-5 years. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this uncertainty is unlikely to be reduced by mass screening for late-stage infection.","BSE; Epidemic size; Mathematical model; Prediction; vCJD","bovine spongiform encephalopathy; epidemic; health risk; medical geography; age distribution; article; bovine spongiform encephalopathy; Creutzfeldt Jakob disease; disease course; epidemic; human; incubation time; mass screening; mathematical model; population exposure; priority journal; United Kingdom; United Kingdom; Bos taurus; Bovinae","Anderson, R.M., Transmission dynamics and epidemiology of BSE in British cattle (1996) Nature, 382, pp. 779-788; Asher, D.M., Gibbs, C.J., David, E., Alpers, M.P., Gajdusek, D.C., Sadowsky, D.A., Experimental kuru in the chimpanzee: Physical findings and clinical laboratory studies (1973) Symp.

METHODS: Incidence data of notifiable communicable diseases during 1975 to 1996 were collected. Time series of measles and scarlet fever incidence during 1975 to 1995, 1980 to 1995, 1985 to 1995 and 1990 to 1995 were established. Correlation analysis was conducted between monthly cumulative percentage and predictive ratio of increase to decrease in incidence rate at the best cut-off point. Prediction was studied based on the constructed extrapolation model. RESULTS: Correlation analysis showed that 98.3% (232/236) of the coefficients of correlation were negative (R < 0), indicating further the existence of Zeng-Ding phenomenon in disease epidemic. There was significant difference in coefficients of correlation between the four time series, which accounted for 63.8%, 54.2%, 44.1% and 35.0%, respectively; and for 73.3%, 56.7%, 36.7% and 36.7%, respectively, in measles, and for 53.6%, 51.8%, 51.7% and 33.3%, respectively, in scarlet fever. It showed that Zeng-Ding phenomenon correlated with the time series and the kinds of diseases. Prediction from extrapolation model showed that there was significant difference in predictive agreement between two time series of 1975 to 1995 (65.5%) and 1985 to 1995 (37.0%) with chi 2 of 4.54 and P < 0.05, indicating a trend that predictive agreement increased with prolonging of time series, and a trend that predictive agreement for scarlet fever increased with decreasing of coefficients of correlation. CONCLUSION: Predictive value of the incidence data can be evaluated by their source and length of time series.",,"article; China; forecasting; human; incidence; measles; methodology; scarlet fever; China; Forecasting; Humans; Incidence; Measles; Scarlet Fever",,"Zhonghua Liu Xing Bing Xue Za Zhi",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033169780

This paper describes a study that used data collected through a national public health surveillance system in the United States to evaluate and compare the performances of a seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) and a dynamic linear model (DLM) for estimating case occurrence of two notifiable diseases. The comparison uses reported cases of malaria and hepatitis A from January 1980 to June 1995 for the United States. The residuals for both predictor models show that they were adequate tools for use in epidemiological surveillance. Qualitative aspects were considered for both models to improve the comparison of their usefulness in public health. Our comparison found that the two forecasting modelling techniques (SARIMA and DLM) are comparable when long historical data are available (at least 52 reporting periods). However, the DLM approach has some advantages, such as being more easily applied to different types of time series and not requiring a new cycle of identification and modelling when new data become available.

We propose that childhood microparasitic infections, notably measles, provide an unusually suitable empirical and theoretical test bed for addressing these issues. We base our analysis on a new mechanistic time series model for measles, the TSIR model, which captures the mechanistic essence of epidemic dynamics. The model, and parameter estimates based on short-term fits to prevaccination measles time series for 60 towns and cities in England and Wales, is introduced in a companion paper. Here, we explore how well the model predicts the long-term dynamics of measles and the balance between noise and determinism, as a function of population size. The TSIR model captures the basic dynamical features of the long-term pattern of measles epidemics in large cities remarkably well (based on time and frequency domain analyses). In particular, the model illustrates the impact of secular increases in birth rates, which cause a transition from biennial to annual dynamics. The model also captures the observed increase in epidemic irregularity with decreasing population size and the onset of local extinction below a critical community size. Decreased host population size is shown to be associated with an increased impact of demographic stochasticity. The interaction between nonlinearity and noise is explored using local Lyapunov exponents (LLE). These testify to the high level of stability of the biennial attractor in large cities. Irregularities are due to the limit cycle evolving with changing human birth rates and not due to complex dynamics. The geometry of the dynamics (sign and magnitude of the LLEs across phase space) is similar in the cities and the smaller urban areas. The qualitative difference in dynamics between small and large host communities is that demographic and extinction-recolonization stochasticities are much more influential in the former. The regional dynamics can therefore only be understood in terms of a core-satellite metapopulation structure for this host-enemy system.

We tested five methods using incidence data reported from health facilities in 20 areas in central and north-western Ethiopia. The accuracy of each method was determined by calculating errors resulting from the difference between observed incidence and corresponding forecasts obtained for prediction intervals of up to 12 months. Simple seasonal adjustment methods outperformed a statistically more advanced autoregressive integrated moving average method. In particular, a seasonal adjustment method that uses mean deviation of the last three observations from expected seasonal values consistently produced the best forecasts. Using 3 years' observation to generate forecasts with this method gave lower errors than shorter or longer periods. Incidence during the rainy months of June-August was the most predictable with this method. Forecasts for the normally dry months, particularly December-February, were less accurate. The study shows the limitations of forecasting incidence from historical morbidity patterns alone, and indicates the need for improved epidemic early warning by incorporating external predictors such as meteorological factors.","Epidemic early warning system; Ethiopia; Forecasting; Malaria; Time series analysis","disease prevalence; forecasting method; health monitoring; malaria; morbidity; accuracy; analytical error; article; controlled study; epidemic; Ethiopia; forecasting; health care facility; human; incidence; malaria; meteorological phenomena; methodology; morbidity; parasite transmission; prediction; seasonal variation; Disease Outbreaks; Ethiopia; Forecasting; Humans; Incidence; Malaria; Models, Statistical; Morbidity; Seasons; Time Factors; Ethiopia; Protozoa","Allard, R., Use of time-series analysis in infectious disease surveillance (1998) Bulletin of the World Health Organization, 76, pp. 327-333; Bouma, M.J., Van der Kaay, J., The El Niño Southern Oscillation and the historic malaria epidemics on the Indian subcontinent and Sri Lanka: An early warning system for future epidemics?

This method was applied to time series data of measles case notification in several communities in the UK, USA and Denmark. The dominant spectral lines observed in each power spectral density (PSD) can be safely assigned as fundamental periods. The optimum least squares fitting (LSF) curve calculated using these fundamental periods can essentially reproduce the underlying variation of the measles data. An extension, of the LSF curve can be used to predict measles case notification quantitatively.

However, the contribution of higher temperatures to vector-borne diseases, particularly malaria, remains controversial despite the known biological dependence of both vector and pathogen on climate. Misconceptions and inappropriate use of variables and methods have contributed to the controversy. At present there appears to be more support for non-climatic explanations to account for the resurgence of malaria in the African highlands, e.g. the deterioration of malaria control and the development of drug resistance. An attempt is made here to show that dismissing temperature as a driving force in the case of malaria is premature. Using a de-trended time-series of malaria incidence in Madagascar between 1972 and 1989 indicated that a minimum temperature during 2 months at the start of the transmission season can account for most of the variability between years (r2 = 0.66). These months correspond with the months when the human-vector (Anopheles gambiae sensu lato) contact is greatest. The relationship between El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and temperature (r = 0.79), and ENSO and malaria (r = 0.64), suggests that there might be an increased epidemic risk during post-Niño years in the Madagascar highlands and therefore warrants increased vigilance and extended control efforts in the first half of 2003. This review suggests that the rejection of climate-disease associations in studies so far published may not have used biologically relevant climate parameters. It highlights the importance of identifying more relevant parameters during critical periods of the transmission season in order to aid epidemic forecasting and to assess the potential impact of global warming.","Climate change; El Niño; Epidemiology; Forecasting; Madagascar; Malaria","Africa; Anopheles gambiae; antibiotic resistance; climate change; disaster; disease transmission; El Nino; environmental impact assessment; environmental temperature; food availability; forecasting; frequency analysis; geography; greenhouse effect; health hazard; host pathogen interaction; incidence; Madagascar; malaria; malaria control; parasite vector; review; risk assessment; seasonal variation; temperature dependence; time series analysis; Anopheles gambiae; Protozoa","(1971) Observatoire D'Antananarivo Bulletin Météorologique Mensuel, , Anonymous Université d'Antananarivo, Madagascar; Bodker, R., Kisinza, W., Malima, R., Msangeni, H., Lindsay, S., Resurgence of malaria in the Usambara mountains, Tanzania, an epidemic of drug-resistant parasites (2000) Global Change and Human Health, 1, pp. 134-153; Bouma, M.J., van der Kaay, H.J., The El Niño Southern Oscillation and the historic malaria epidemics on the Indian subcontinent and Sri Lanka: An early warning system for future epidemics?

For measles, a simple model has indicated that epidemic patterns represent attractors of a nonlinear dynamic system and that transitions between different attractors are driven by slow changes in birth rates and vaccination levels. The same analysis can explain the main features of chickenpox dynamics, but fails for rubella and whooping cough. We show that an additional (perturbative) analysis of the model, together with knowledge of the population size in question, can account for all the observed incidence patterns by predicting how stochastically sustained transient dynamics should be manifested in these systems.","Childhood disease dynamics; Demographic stochasticity; Perturbation theory; Poincaré map; Seasonal forcing; SEIR model","epidemic; analytic method; article; birth rate; chickenpox; child; childhood disease; compartment model; epidemic; human; incidence; measles; measles vaccination; nonlinear system; pertussis; population dynamics; population size; prediction; priority journal; rubella; statistical analysis; stochastic model","Anderson, R.M., May, R.M., (1991) Infectious Diseases of Humans, , Oxford University Press; Anderson, R.M., Grenfell, B.T., May, R.M., Oscillatory fluctuations in the incidence of infectious disease and the impact of vaccination: Time series analysis (1984) J.

The authors applied it to forecasting the incidences of influenza-like illnesses (ILI) in France and in the country's 21 administrative regions, using a series of data for 938 consecutive weeks of ILI surveillance between 1984 and 2002, and compared the results with those for autoregressive models. For 1- to 10-week-ahead predictions, the correlation coefficients between the observed and forecasted regional incidences ranged from 0.81 to 0.66 for the method of analogues and from 0.73 to -0.09 for the autoregressive models (p < 0.001). Similar results were obtained for national incidence forecasts. From the results of this method, maps of influenza epidemic forecasts can be made in countries in which national and regional data are available.","Communicable disease control; Diffusion; Epidemiologic methods;

To evaluate recurrent neural networks as a predictive technique for time-series in the health field. Methods. The study was carried out during a cholera epidemic which took place in 1993 and 1994 in the state of Ceará, northeastern Brazil, and was based on excess deaths having 'poorly defined intestinal infections' as the underlying cause (ICD-9). The monthly number of deaths with due to this cause between 1979 and 1995 in the state of Ceará was obtained from the Ministry of Health's Mortality Information System (SIM). A network comprising two neurons in the input layer, twelve in the hidden layer, one in the output layer, and one in the memory layer was trained by backpropagation using the fist 150 observations, with 0.01 learning rate and 0.9 momentum. Training was ended after 22,000 epochs. We compare the results with those of a negative binomial regression. Results. ANN forecasting was adequate. Excessive mortality (number of deaths above the upper limit of the confidence interval) was detected in December 1993 and October/November 1994. However, negative binomial regression detected excess mortality from March 1992 onwards. Conclusions. The artificial neural network showed good predictive ability, especially in the initial period, and was able to detect alterations concomitant and a subsequent to the cholera epidemic. However, it was less precise that the binomial regression model, which was more sensitive to abnormal data concomitant with cholera circulation.","Cholera, epidemiology; Epidemiologic surveillance; Forecasting; Neural networks (computer); Time series","article; artificial neural network; binomial distribution; Brazil; cause of death; cholera; confidence interval; controlled study; disease classification; epidemic; forecasting; human; information system; learning; mortality; observation; prediction; public health service; regression analysis; time series analysis; training","Alves, M.T., Silva, A.A.M., Nemes, M.I.B., Brito, G.O., Tendência da incidência e da mortalidade por Aids no Maranhão, 1985 a 1998 (2003) Rev.

Underlying its multi-strain structure is the evolutionary process of antigenic drift whereby epitope mutations give mutant virions a selective advantage. While there is substantial understanding of the molecular mechanisms of antigenic drift, until now there has been no quantitative analysis of this process at the population level. The aim of this study is to develop a predictive model that is of a modest-enough structure to be fitted to time series data on weekly flu incidence. We observe that the rate of antigenic drift is highly non-uniform and identify several years where there have been antigenic surges where a new strain substantially increases infective pressure. The SIR-S approach adopted here can also be shown to improve forecasting in comparison to conventional methods.

N1G 2W1, Canada","The invasion of new species and the spread of emergent infectious diseases in spatially structured populations has stimulated the study of explicit spatial models such as cellular automata, network models and lattice models. However, the analytic intractability of these models calls for the development of tractable mathematical approximations that can capture the dynamics of discrete, spatially-structured populations. Here we explore moment closure approximations for the invasion of an SIS epidemic on a regular lattice. We use moment closure methods to derive an expression for the basic reproductive number, R0, in a lattice population. On lattices, R0 should be bounded above by the number of neighbors per individual. However, we show that conventional pair approximations actually predict unbounded growth in R0 with increasing transmission rates. To correct this problem, we propose an 'invasory' pair approximation which yields a relatively simple expression for R0 that remains bounded above, and also predicts R0 values from lattice model simulations more accurately than conventional pair and triple approximations. The invasory pair approximation is applicable to any spatial model, since it takes into account characteristics of invasions that are common to all spatially structured populations. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Improving over the classical SIR approach, we introduce a fourth class (C) for the cross-immune individuals in the population, i.e., those that recovered after being infected by different strains of the same viral subtype in the past years. The SIRC model predicts that the prevalence of a virus is maximum for an intermediate value of R0, the basic reproduction number. Via a bifurcation analysis of the model, we discuss the effect of seasonality on the epidemiological regimes. For realistic parameter values, the model exhibits a rich variety of behaviors, including chaos and multi-stable periodic outbreaks. Comparison with empirical evidence shows that the simulated regimes are qualitatively and quantitatively consistent with reality, both for tropical and temperate countries. We find that the basins of attraction of coexisting cycles can be fractal sets, thus predictability can in some cases become problematic even theoretically. In accordance with previous studies, we find that increasing cross-immunity tends to complicate the dynamics of the system. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Many human and wildlife systems, however, have small groups with limited movement among groups. In these situations, the basic reproductive number, R0, is likely to be a poor predictor of a disease pandemic because it typically does not account for group structure and movement of individuals among groups. We extend recent work by combining the movement of hosts, transmission within groups, recovery from infection and the recruitment of new susceptibles into a stochastic model of disease in a host metapopulation. We focus on how recruitment of susceptibles affects disease invasion and how population structure can affect the frequency of superspreading events (SSEs). We show that the frequency of SSEs may decrease with the reduced movement and the group sizes due to the limited number of susceptible individuals available. Classification tree analysis of the model results illustrates the hierarchical nature of disease invasion in host metapopulations. First, the pathogen must effectively transmit within a group (R0 &gt; 1), and then the pathogen must persist within a group long enough to allow for movement among the groups. Therefore, the factors affecting disease persistence - such as infectious period, group size and recruitment of new susceptibles - are as important as the local transmission rates in predicting the spread of pathogens across a metapopulation. © 2006 The Royal Society.","Disease; Invasion; Metapopulation; SIR model; Superspreader","article; controlled study; disease classification; disease course; disease transmission; epidemic; group structure; histogram; host pathogen interaction; human; infection rate; infection sensitivity; metapopulation; organism group size; pandemic; predictor variable; stochastic model; basic reproduction number; computer simulation; population dynamics; theoretical model; Basic Reproduction Number; Computer Simulation; Disease Outbreaks; Humans; Models, Theoretical; Population Dynamics","Altizer, S., Social organization and parasite risk in mammals: Integrating theory and empirical studies (2003) Annu.

The goal of this research was to develop a model to back-calculate the day HPAI virus is introduced into a flock, based on within-flock mortality data. The back-calculation method was based on a stochastic SEIR (susceptible (S) - latently infected (E) - infectious (I) - removed (= dead; R)) epidemic model. The latent and infectious period were assumed to be gamma distributed. Parameter values were based on experimental H7N7 within-flock transmission data. The model was used to estimate the day of virus introduction based on a defined within-flock mortality threshold (detection rule for determining AI). Our results indicate that approximately two weeks can elapse before a noticeable increase in mortality is observed after a single introduction into a flock. For example, it takes twelve (minimum 11 - maximum 15) days before AI is detected if the detection rule is fifty dead chickens on two consecutive days in a 10 000 chicken flock (current Dutch monitoring rule for notification). The results were robust for flock size and detection rule, but sensitive to the length of the latent and infectious periods. Furthermore, assuming multiple introductions on one day will result in a shorter estimated period between infection and detection. The implications of the model outcomes for detecting and tracing outbreaks of H7N7 HPAI virus are discussed. © INRA, EDP Sciences, 2007.","Back-calculation; H7N7; Highly pathogenic avian influenza; SEIR model; Within-flock mortality","article; avian influenza; disease transmission; epidemic; infection control; infection risk; Influenza virus A H7N7; mortality; outcome assessment; pathogenesis; pathogenicity; poultry; probability; sensitivity analysis; simulation; virus detection; animal; animal disease; avian influenza; biological model; chicken; computer simulation; health survey; Netherlands; population density; prediction and forecasting; statistics; time; virology; virus latency; Aves; Avian influenza virus; Gallus gallus; Animals; Chickens; Computer Simulation; Disease Outbreaks; Influenza A Virus, H7N7 Subtype; Influenza in Birds; Models, Biological; Mortality; Netherlands; Population Density; Predictive Value of Tests; Sentinel Surveillance; Stochastic Processes; Time Factors; Virus Latency","Begon, M., Bennett, M., Bowers, R.G., French, N.P., Hazel, S.M., Turner, J., A clarification of transmission terms in host-microparasite models: Numbers, densities and areas (2002) Epidemiol.

The prediction ability of a semi-mechanistic time series model that incorporates both these elements is examined. Results show that ENSO is a key covariate and confirm the importance of its interplay with immunity levels, now from the perspective of prediction. They support the feasibility of using the model as a forecasting tool: the lack of extreme events between 2001 and 2005 would have been anticipated with 75% confidence half a year ahead with a model fitted to data up to 2000. Long-term change in the transmission rate, the non-mechanistic part of the model, sets limits to the forecasting horizon because of a breakdown in its relationship with river discharge towards the end of the 1990s. We discuss this and other limitations of the approach as well as future directions related to the development of an early warning system for cholera in this region. © Inter-Research 2008.","Cholera prediction; Climate forcing; Early-warning systems; ENSO; Nonlinear disease dynamics; Population immunity; Time series model; TSIRS","Bacteria; Climate change; Climatology; Diseases; Mathematical models; Time series analysis; Weather forecasting; cholera; climate effect; climate forcing; climate variation; early warning system; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; endemism; prediction; time series analysis; Asia; Bangladesh; Eurasia; South Asia","Abeku, T.A., Vlas, S.J.D.E., Boorsboom, G.J.J.M., Tagede, A., and others, Effects of meteorological factors on epidemic malaria in Ethiopia: A statistical modeling approach based on theoretical reasoning (2004) Parasitology, 128, pp. 585-593; Anderson, R.M., May, R.M.C., (1991) Infectious diseases of humans: Dynamics and control, , Oxford University Press, Oxford; Bouma MJ, Pascual M (2001) Contributions of climate and geography to seasonal and interannual cycles of endemic cholera in Bengal 1891-1940.

A major difficulty for inference is that (i) the latent transmission process is partially observed and (ii) observed quantities are further aggregated temporally. We develop a data augmentation strategy to tackle these problems and introduce a diffusion process that mimicks the susceptible-infectious-removed (SIR) epidemic process, but that is more tractable analytically. While methods based on discrete-time models require epidemic and data collection processes to have similar time scales, our approach, based on a continuous-time model, is free of such constraint. Using simulated data, we found that all parameters of the SIR model, including the generation time, were estimated accurately if the observation interval was less than 2.5 times the generation time of the disease. Previous discrete-time TSIR models have been unable to estimate generation times, given that they assume the generation time is equal to the observation interval. However, we were unable to estimate the generation time of measles accurately from historical data. This indicates that simple models assuming homogenous mixing (even with age structure) of the type which are standard in mathematical epidemiology miss key features of epidemics in large populations. © 2007 The Royal Society.","Bayesian inference; Cox-Ingersoll-Ross model; Epidemics; Markov chain Monte Carlo methods; Measles; Susceptible-infectious-removed model","Continuous time systems; Estimation; Health; Markov processes; Mixing; Parameter estimation; Standards; (e ,3e) process; age structures; Continuous time (CT) model; Continuous-time (CT); Data augmentation (DA); data collections; Diffusion processes; Discrete time (DT); Discrete-time modeling; Epidemic models; Generation time; Generation times; Historical data; Mathematical epidemiology; Simple modeling; Simulated data; SIR models; Statistical approaches; time scaling; Time series data; Transmission processing; Population statistics; accuracy; article; Bayes theorem; epidemic; human; measles; Monte Carlo method; prediction; probability; statistical model; time series analysis; United Kingdom; virus transmission","Anderson, R.M., May, R.M., (1991) Infectious diseases of humans: Dynamics and control, , Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press; Auranen, K., Arjas, E., Leino, T., Takala, A.K., Transmission of pneumococcal carriage in families: A latent markov process model for binary longitudinal data (2000) J.

To strengthen the country's prevention and control measures, this study was carried out to develop forecasting and prediction models of malaria incidence in the endemic districts of Bhutan using time series and ARIMAX. Methods: This study was carried out retrospectively using the monthly reported malaria cases from the health centres to Vector-borne Disease Control Programme (VDCP) and the meteorological data from Meteorological Unit, Department of Energy, Ministry of Economic Affairs. Time series analysis was performed on monthly malaria cases, from 1994 to 2008, in seven malaria endemic districts. The time series models derived from a multiplicative seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) was deployed to identify the best model using data from 1994 to 2006. The best-fit model was selected for each individual district and for the overall endemic area was developed and the monthly cases from January to December 2009 and 2010 were forecasted. In developing the prediction model, the monthly reported malaria cases and the meteorological factors from 1996 to 2008 of the seven districts were analysed. The method of ARIMAX modelling was employed to determine predictors of malaria of the subsequent month. Results: It was found that the ARIMA (p, d, q) (P, D, Q)s model (p and P representing the auto regressive and seasonal autoregressive; d and D representing the non-seasonal differences and seasonal differencing; and q and Q the moving average parameters and seasonal moving average parameters, respectively and s representing the length of the seasonal period) for the overall endemic districts was (2,1,1)(0,1,1)12; the modelling data from each district revealed two most common ARIMA models including (2,1,1)(0,1,1)12 and (1,1,1)(0,1,1)12. The forecasted monthly malaria cases from January to December 2009 and 2010 varied from 15 to 82 cases in 2009 and 67 to 149 cases in 2010, where population in 2009 was 285,375 and the expected population of 2010 to be 289,085. The ARIMAX model of monthly cases and climatic factors showed considerable variations among the different districts. In general, the mean maximum temperature lagged at one month was a strong positive predictor of an increased malaria cases for four districts. The monthly number of cases of the previous month was also a significant predictor in one district, whereas no variable could predict malaria cases for two districts. Conclusions: The ARIMA models of time-series analysis were useful in forecasting the number of cases in the endemic areas of Bhutan. There was no consistency in the predictors of malaria cases when using ARIMAX model with selected lag times and climatic predictors. The ARIMA forecasting models could be employed for planning and managing malaria prevention and control programme in Bhutan. © 2010 Wangdi et al.",,"Article; autoregressive integrated moving average model; Bhutan; case study; climate change; endemic disease; health center; health program; human; humidity; incidence; malaria; malaria control; Plasmodium; prediction and forecasting; retrospective study; seasonal variation; temperature measurement; time series analysis; article; Bhutan; disease transmission; forecasting; season; statistical model; time; weather; Bhutan; Forecasting; Humans; Incidence; Malaria; Models, Statistical; Retrospective Studies; Seasons; Time Factors; Weather","Breman, J.G., The ears of the hippopotamus: Manifestations, determinants, and estimates of the malaria burden (2001) Am J Trop Med Hyg, 64 (1-2), pp. 1-11; Greenwood, B.M., Bojang, K., Whitty, C.J., Targett, G.A., Malaria (2005) Lancet, 365, pp. 1487-1498; Mishra, S.K., Mohapatra, S., Mohanty, S., Jaundice in Falciparum Malaria (2003) JIACM, 4, pp. 12-13; Snow, R.W., Guerra, C.A., Noor, A.M., Myint, H.Y., Hay, S.I., The global distribution of clinical episodes of Plasmodium falciparum malaria (2005) Nature, 434, pp. 214-217; Martens, W.J.M., Niessen, L.W., Rotmans, J., Jetten, T.H., McMichael, A.J., Potential impact of global climate change on malaria risk (1995) Environ Health Perspect, 103, pp. 458-464; Trenberth, K.E., Climate variability and global warming (2001) Science, 293, pp. 48-49; McMichael, A.J., Woodruff, R.E., Hales, S., Climate change and human health: Present and future risks (2006) Lancet, 367, pp. 859-869; (2007) Annual Report; Malaria Disease Burden in SEA Region, , http://www.searo.who.int/EN/Section10/Section21/Section340_4018.htm, WHO; Chaikaew, N., Tripathi, N.K., Hara, S., Exploring spatial and spatio-temporal clusters of malaria in Chiang Mai, Thailand (2008) International Symposium on Geoinformatics for Spatial Infrastructure Development in Earth and Allied Sciences; Childs, D.Z., Cattadori, I.M., Suwonkerd, W., Prajakwong, S., Boots, M., Spatiotemporal patterns of malaria incidence in northern Thailand (2006) Trans R Soc Trop Med Hyg J, 100, pp. 623-631; Yeshiwondim, A., Gopal, S., Hailemariam, A., Dengela, D., Patel, H., Spatial analysis of malaria incidence at the village level in areas with unstable transmission in Ethiopia (2009) International Journal of Health Geographics, 8, p. 5; Zhou, G., Sirichaisinthop, J., Sattabongkot, J., Jones, J., Bjornstad, O.N., Yan, G., Cui, L., Spatio-temporal distribution of Plasmodium falciparum and P.

The vehicle of infection (Vibrio cholerae) is transported through the network links that are thought of as hydrological connections among susceptible communities. The mathematical tools used are borrowed from general schemes of reactive transport on river networks acting as the environmental matrix for the circulation and mixing of waterborne pathogens. Using the diffusion approximation, we analytically derive the speed of propagation for travelling fronts of epidemics on regular lattices (either one-dimensional or two-dimensional) endowed with uniform population density. Power laws are found that relate the propagation speed to the diffusion coefficient and the basic reproduction number. We numerically obtain the related, slower speed of epidemic spreading for more complex, yet realistic river structures such as Peano networks and optimal channel networks. The analysis of the limit case of uniformly distributed population sizes proves instrumental in establishing the overall conditions for the relevance of spatially explicit models. To that extent, the ratio between spreading and disease outbreak time scales proves the crucial parameter. The relevance of our results lies in the major differences potentially arising between the predictions of spatially explicit models and traditional compartmental models of the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR)-like type. Our results suggest that in many cases of real-life epidemiological interest, time scales of disease dynamics may trigger outbreaks that significantly depart from the predictions of compartmental models. © 2009 The Royal Society.","Optimal channel network and Peano network; Reproduction number; Scaling laws; SIR-like models; Travelling waves","Forecasting; Optimization; Population statistics; Wave transmission; Basic reproduction number; Compartmental model; Crucial parameters; Diffusion approximations; Diffusion Coefficients; Disease dynamics; Disease outbreaks; Environmental matrixes; Epidemic spreading; Local community; Mathematical tools; Network links; Optimal channel network and Peano network; Optimal channels; Population densities; Population sizes; Power law; Propagation speed; Reactive transport; Regular lattice; Reproduction number; River network; Spatially explicit; Spatially explicit models; Speed of propagation; Time-scales; Travelling front; Travelling waves; Vibrio cholerae; Water-borne pathogens; Disease control; active transport; article; bacterial reproduction; basic reproduction number; cholera; diffusion coefficient; epidemic; human; nonhuman; Vibrio cholerae; Vibrio cholerae","Abramowitz, M., Stegun, I., (1965) Handbook of mathematical functions, , New York, NY: Dover Publications; Aparicio, J.P., Pascual, M., Building epidemiological models from R0: An implicit treatment of transmission in networks (2007) Proc.

The nonstandard finite difference scheme with Conservation Law (NSFDCL) developed here satisfies some important properties associated with the considered SIR epidemic model, such as positivity, boundedness, monotonicity, stability and conservation of frequency of the oscillations. Numerical comparisons between the NSFDCL numerical scheme developed here and Runge-Kutta type schemes show its effectiveness. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Epidemic model SIR; Nonstandard finite difference schemes; Numerical solution; Predictor-corrector","Boundedness; Conservation law; Continuous models; Epidemic models; Monotonicity; Nonstandard finite difference schemes; Nonstandard finite differences; Numerical comparison; Numerical scheme; Numerical solution; Predictor corrector; Runge-Kutta; SIR epidemic model; Epidemiology; Finite difference method; Runge Kutta methods; Mathematical models","Mickens, R.E., (1994) Nonstandard Finite Difference Models of Differential Equations, , World Scientific; Mickens, R.E., (2000) Applications of Nonstandard Finite Difference Schemes, , World Scientific, Singapore; Mickens, R.E., Numerical integration of population models satisfying conservation laws: NSFD methods (2007) Journal of Biological Dynamics, 1 (4), pp. 427-436; Mickens, R.E., Dynamic consistency: a fundamental principle for constructing nonstandard finite difference schemes for differential equations (2005) Journal of Difference Equations and Applications, 11 (7), pp. 645-653; Anguelov, R., Lubuma, J.M.-S., Contributions to the mathematics of the nonstandard finite difference method and applications (2001) Numerical Methods for Partial Differential Equations, 17 (5), pp. 518-543; Anguelov, R., Lubuma, J.M.S., Nonstandard finite difference method by nonlocal approximation (2003) Mathematics and Computers in Simulation, 61 (3-6), pp. 465-475; Dimitrov, D.T., Kojouharov, H.V., Positive and elementary stable nonstandard numerical methods with applications to predator-prey models (2006) Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics, (1-2), pp. 98-108; Solis, F.J., Chen-Charpentier, B., Nonstandard discrete approximations preserving stability properties of continuous mathematical models (2004) Mathematical & Computer Modelling, 40, pp. 481-490; Chen-Charpentier, B.M., Dimitrov, D.T., Kojouharov, H.V., Combined nonstandard numerical methods for ODEs with polynomial right-hand sides (2006) Mathematics and Computers in Simulation, 73, pp. 105-113; Villanueva, R., Arenas, A.J., González-Parra, G., A nonstandard dynamically consistent numerical scheme applied to obesity dynamics (2008) Journal of Applied Mathematics, 2008, p. 14; Arenas, A.J., Moran ̂o, J.A., Cortés, J.C., Non-standard numerical method for a mathematical model of RSV epidemiological transmission (2008) Computers & Mathematics with Applications, 56, pp. 670-678; Moghadas, S.M., Alexander, M.E., Corbett, B.D., Gumel, A.B., A positivity preserving mickens-type discretization of an epidemic model (2003) Journal of Difference Equations and Applications, 9 (11), pp. 1037-1051; Piyawong, W., Twizell, E.H., Gumel, A.B., An unconditionally convergent finite-difference scheme for the SIR model (2003) Applied Mathematics and Computation, 146, pp. 611-625; Jansen, H., Twizell, E.H., An unconditionally convergent discretization of the SEIR model (2002) Mathematics and Computers in Simulation, 58, pp. 147-158; Gumel, A.B., Mickens, R.E., Corbett, B.D., A non-standard finite-difference scheme for a model of HIV transmission and control (2003) Journal of Computational Methods in Sciences and Engineering, 3 (1), pp. 91-98; Jódar, L., Villanueva, R.J., Arenas, A.J., González, G.C., Nonstandard numerical methods for a mathematical model for influenza disease (2008) Mathematics and Computers in Simulation, 79, pp. 622-633; Lambert, J.D., (1973) Computational Methods in Ordinary Differential Equations, , Wiley, New York; Duncan, C.J., Duncan, S.R., Scott, S., Whooping cough epidemic in London, 1701-1812: infection dynamics seasonal forcing and the effects of malnutrition (1996) Proceedings of the Royal Society of London, Series B, 263, pp. 445-450; Mickens, R.E., Calculation of denominator functions for nonstandard finite difference schemes for differential equations satisfying a positivity condition (2006) Wiley InterScience, 23 (3), pp. 672-691; Brauer, F., Castillo-Chavez, C., (2001) Mathematical Models in Population Biology and Epidemiology, , Springer-Verlag","Comput Math Appl",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-77953228943

The system collected data on the number of prescriptions from approximately 3350 pharmacies, which account for almost 7% of all pharmacies in Japan, and published the number online on a daily basis, except for Sundays. On the basis of these data, we further estimated R v and predicted its course every Monday using a very simple SIR model with data from previous studies. This paper summarizes our real-time estimation and prediction of ILI patients in the 2009 influenza A/H1N1 pandemic. The estimate on November 29 resulted in an R v of 1.72 (95%CI [1.69, 1.75]). The model predicted that the peak of the epidemic would be reached on December 23 2009 [December 14, 2009, January 2, 2010] with an estimated number of ILI patients of 227,000 [193,000, 262,000]. The cumulative number of ILI patients over the period would be as high as 17.8% [16.6, 19.0%] of the total population of Japan. This information was circulated weekly among central and local government officers in charge of pandemic control to provide updates on the pandemic situation and to aid their decision-making on control strategies. In conclusion, for the first time in the world, we successfully demonstrated real-time estimation and prediction for the entire course of a pandemic, and which could be used routinely for planning counter-measures. © 2011 Japanese Society of Chemotherapy and The Japanese Association for Infectious Diseases.","Oseltamivir; Pandemic flu; Pharmacy survey; Real-time estimation; Zanamivir","oseltamivir; zanamivir; 2009 H1N1 influenza; article; compartment model; control strategy; data collection method; decision making; disease surveillance; drug surveillance program; human; influenza; influenza like illness; Japan; pharmacy survey; prediction; prescription; seasonal variation; sentinel surveillance; SIR model","Ferguson, N.M., Cummings, D.A.T., Cauchemez, S., Fraser, C., Riley, S., Meeyai, A., Iamsirithaworn, S., Burke, D.S., Strategies for containing an emerging influenza pandemic in Southeast Asia (2005) Nature, 437 (7056), pp. 209-214. , DOI 10.1038/nature04017; Longini Jr., I.M., Nizam, A., Xu, S., Ungchusak, K., Hanshaoworakul, W., Cummings, D.A.T., Halloran, M.E., Containing pandemic influenza at the source (2005) Science, 309 (5737), pp. 1083-1087. , DOI 10.1126/science.1115717; Germann, T.C., Kadau, L., Longini Jr., I.M., MacKen, C.A., Mitigation strategies for pandemic influenza in the United States (2006) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 103, pp. 5935-5940. , 16585506 10.1073/pnas.0601266103 1:CAS:528:DC%2BD28XktFaitLg%3D; Ferguson, N.M., Cummings, D.A.T., Fraser, C., Cajka, J.C., Cooley, P.C., Burke, D.S., Strategies for mitigating an influenza pandemic (2006) Nature, 442 (7101), pp. 448-452. , DOI 10.1038/nature04795, PII NATURE04795; Ohkusa, Y., Sugawara, T., Simulation model of pandemic influenza in the whole of Japan (2009) J Jpn Infect Dis, 62 (2), pp. 98-106; Fraser, C., Donnelly, C., Cauchemez, S., Hanage, W.P., Van Kerkhove, M.D., Hollingsworth, T.D., Pandemic potential of a strain of influenza A (H1N1): Early findings (2009) Science, 324 (5934), pp. 1557-1561. , 19433588 10.1126/science.1176062 1:CAS:528:DC%2BD1MXnsFOrsrk%3D; Mangili, A., Gendreau, M.A., Transmission of infectious diseases during commercial air travel (2005) Lancet, 365 (9463), pp. 989-996. , DOI 10.1016/S0140-6736(05)71089-8, PII S0140673605710898; Elizabeth Halloran, M., Longini, I.M., Cowart, D.M., Nizam, A., Community interventions and the epidemic prevention potential (2002) Vaccine, 20 (27-28), pp. 3254-3262. , DOI 10.1016/S0264-410X(02)00316-X, PII S0264410X0200316X; Nishiura, H., Castillo-Chavez, C., Safan, M., Chowell, G., Transmission potential of the new influenza A (H1N1) virus and its age-specificity in Japan (2009) Euro Surveill, 14 (22), pp. 1-4; Kash, J.C., Qi, L., Dugan, V.G., Jagger, B.W., Hrabal, R.J., Memoli, M.J., Prior infection with classical swine H1N1 influenza viruses is associated with protective immunity to the 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus (2010) Influenza Other Respi Viruses, 4 (3), pp. 121-127. , 20409208 10.1111/j.1750-2659.2010.00132.x 1:CAS:528:DC%2BC3cXntVymsLg%3D; Yoshida, M., Matsui, T., Ohkusa, Y., Seasonal influenza surveillance using prescription data for anti-influenza medications (2009) JJID, 62 (2), pp. 233-235; Kawai, N., Kawade, Y., Kobayashi, H., Real-time pharmacy surveillance and estimation of influenza patients during 2009/2010 influenza pandemic (in Japanese) (2010) Nihonijisinpou, 4487, pp. 58-64","J.

Methods: Time-series curves for the weekly counts of laboratory-confirmed H1N1 cases in Manitoba during the 2009 pandemic were plotted against the three syndromic indicators: 1) GFT data, based on flu-related Internet search queries, 2) weekly count of all ED visits triaged as influenza-like illness (ED ILI volume), and 3) percentage of all ED visits that were triaged as an ILI (ED ILI percent). A linear regression model was fitted separately for each indicator and correlations with weekly virologic data were calculated for different lag periods for each pandemic wave. Results: All three indicators peaked 1-2 weeks earlier than the epidemic curve of laboratory-confirmed cases. For GFT data, the best-fitting model had about a 2-week lag period in relation to the epidemic curve. Similarly, the best-fitting models for both ED indicators were observed for a time lag of 1-2 weeks. All three indicators performed better as predictors of the virologic time trends during the second wave as compared to the first. There was strong congruence between the time series of the GFT and both the ED ILI volume and the ED ILI percent indicators. Conclusion: During an influenza season characterized by high levels of disease activity, GFT and ED indicators provided a good indication of weekly counts of laboratory-confirmed influenza cases in Manitoba 1-2 weeks in advance. © Canadian Public Health Association, 2011.","Epidemiology; H1N1 subtype; Influenza a virus; Public health surveillance",,"Elliot, A., Syndromic surveillance: The next phase of public health monitoring during the H1N1 influenza pandemic (2009) Euro Surveill, 14, p. 44; (2008) Syndromic Surveillance: An Applied Approach to Outbreak Detection, , http://www.cdc.gov/ncphi/disss/nndss/syndromic.htm, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Accessed October 1, 2010; Carneiro Herman, A., Mylonakis, E., Google Trends: A web-based tool for realtime surveillance of disease outbreaks (2009) Clin Infect Dis, 49 (10), pp. 1557-1564; Seifter, A., Schwarzwalder, A., Geis, K., Aucott, J., The utility of ""Google Trends"" for epidemiological research: Lyme disease as an example (2010) Geospatial Health, 4 (2), pp. 135-137; Wilson, N., Mason, K., Tobias, M., Peacey, M., Huang, Q., Baker, M., Interpreting Google Flu Trends data for pandemic H1N1 influenza: The New Zealand experience (2009) Euro Surveillance: Bulletin Européen Sur Les Maladies Transmissibles= European Communicable Disease Bulletin, 14 (44); Kelly, H., Grant, K., Interim analysis of pandemic influenza (H1N1) 2009 in Australia: Surveillance trends, age of infection and effectiveness of seasonal vaccination (2009) Euro Surveill, 14 (31), p. 2; Pelat, C., Turbelin, C., Bar-Hen, A., Flahault, A., Valleron, A.-J., More diseases tracked by using Google trends (2009) Emerg Infect Dis, 15 (8), p. 1327. , Letter to the editor; (2010) Google Flu Trends-Canada, , www.google.org/, Accessed May 9; Ginsberg, J., Mohebbi, M.H., Patel, R.S., Brammer, L., Smolinski, M.S., Brilliant, L., Detecting influenza epidemics using search engine query data (2009) Nature, 457 (7232), pp. 1012-1014. , 10.1038/nature07634; (2009) Flu Watch For September 6, 2009 to September 12, 2009 (Week 36), , http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/fluwatch/09-10/w36_09/index-eng.php, Public Health Agency of Canada, Accessed September 23, 2009; (2010) General Information On Lab-Confirmed Cases of Pandemic H1N1 Influenza, , http://www.gov.mb.ca/health/pub-lichealth/sri/stats1.html, Manitoba Health, Accessed July 10, 2010; (2010), MATLAB version 7.10.0 (R2010a).

Unfortunately, virus writers have begun exploiting lax security in many mobile devices and subsequently developed malware exploiting proximity-based propagation mechanisms (e.g. Cabir or CommWarrior). So, if given an ad-hoc network of such mobile users, will a proximity-spreading virus survive or die out; that is, can we determine the ""tipping point"" between survival and die out? What effect does the average user velocity have on such spread? We answer the initial questions and more. Our contributions in this paper are: (a) we present a framework for analyzing epidemic spreading processes on mobile ad hoc networks, (b) using our framework, we are the first to derive the epidemic threshold for any mobility model under the SIS model, and (c) we show that the node velocity in mobility models does not affect the epidemic threshold. Additionally, we introduce a periodic mobility model and provide evaluation via our framework. We validate our theoretical predictions using a combination of simulated and synthetic mobility data, showing ultimately, our predictions accurately estimate the epidemic threshold of such systems. © 2011 IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.",,"Epidemic spread; Epidemic spreading; Epidemic threshold; Malwares; Mobile users; Mobility model; Point-to-point communication; Propagation mechanism; SIS model; Theoretical prediction; Tipping point; Virus writers; Epidemic spread; Epidemic spreading; Epidemic threshold; Mobility datum; Mobility model; Point-to-point communication; Propagation mechanism; Tipping point; C (programming language); Computer viruses; Dies; Epidemiology; Forecasting; Global system for mobile communications; Mobile ad hoc networks; Mobile devices; Models; Portable equipment; Telecommunication networks; Viruses; Ad hoc networks; Computer viruses; Epidemiology; Forecasting; Mobile devices; Mobile security; Mobile telecommunication systems; Secure communication; Telecommunication networks; Viruses; Ad hoc networks; Mobile ad hoc networks","Anderson, R.M., May, R.M., (1991) Infectious Diseases of Humans, , Oxford University Press, Oxford; Bailey, N.T.J., (1975) The Mathematical Theory of Infectious Diseases and Its Applications, , Charles Griffin and Company Ltd., London; Barabasi, A.L., Albert, R., Emergence of scaling in random networks (1999) Science, 286 (5439), pp. 509-512; Barrett, C.L., Bisset, K.R., Eubank, S.G., Feng, X., Marathe, M.V., EpiSimdemics: An efficient algorithm for simulating the spread of infectious disease over large realistic social networks (2008) ACM/IEEE Conf. on Supercomputing; Bettstetter, C., Resta, G., Santi, P., The node distribution of the random waypoint mobility model for wireless Ad Hoc networks (2003) IEEE Trans. on Mobile Computing, 2 (3); Camp, T., Boleng, J., Davies, V., A survey of mobility models for ad hoc network research (2002) Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing, 2 (5), pp. 483-502. , DOI 10.1002/wcm.72; Chakrabarti, D., Wang, Y., Wang, C., Leskovec, J., Faloutsos, C., Epidemic thresholds in real networks (2008) ACM TISSEC, 10 (4); Chakrabarti, D., Leskovec, J., Faloutsos, C., Madden, S., Guestrin, C., Faloutsos, M., Information survival threshold in sensor and p2p networks (2007) IEEE ICC; Domingos, P., Richardson, M., Mining the network value of customers (2001) ACM SIGKDD 2001, pp. 57-66. , ACM Press, New York; Faloutsos, M., Faloutsos, P., Faloutsos, C., On power-law relationships of the Internet topology (1999) Computer Communication Review, 29 (4), pp. 251-262. , DOI 10.1145/316194.316229; Ganesh, A., Massoulie, L., Towsley, D., The effect of network topology in spread of epidemics (2005) IEEE INFOCOM; Gonsalves, A., Android phones steal market share (2010) Information Week, 4. , http://www.informationweek.com/news/mobility/smart_phones/showArticle. jhtml?articleID=224201881; Hethcote, H.W., The mathematics of infectious diseases (2000) SIAMRev., 42 (4), pp. 599-653; Johnson, D.B., Maltz, D.A., Dynamic source routing in Ad Hoc wireless networks (1996) Mobile Computing; Kephart, J.O., White, S.R., Directed-graph epidemiological models of computer viruses (1991) IEEE Security and Privacy, pp. 343-359. , May; Kephart, J.O., White, S.R., Measuring and modeling computer virus prevalence (1993) IEEE Security and Privacy 1993, pp. 2-15. , May; Kumar, S., Raghavan, P., Rajagopalan, S., Tomkins, A., Trawling the web for emerging cyber-communities (1999) Computer Networks, 31 (11-16), pp. 1481-1493; Mickens, J.W., Noble, B.D., Modeling epidemic spreading in mobile environments (2005) WiSe - Proceedings of the 2005 ACM Workshop on Wireless Security, pp. 77-86. , WiSe - Proceedings of the 2005 ACM Workshop on Wireless Security; Mickens, J.W., Noble, B.D., Analytical models for epidemics in mobile networks (2007) IEEE WiMob 2007, p. 77; Moreno, Y., Pastor-Satorras, R., Vespignani, A., Epidemic outbreaks in complex heterogeneous networks (2002) European Physical Journal B, 26 (4), pp. 521-529. , DOI 10.1007/s10051-002-8996-y; Newman, M., Threshold effects for two pathogens spreading on a network (2005) Phys.

Detailed individual-based mathematical models on complex networks play an important role towards this aim. In this work, it is shown how one can exploit the Equation-Free approach and optimization methods such as Simulated Annealing to bridge detailed individual-based epidemic models with coarse-grained, system-level analysis within a pair-wise representation perspective. The proposed computational methodology provides a systematic approach for analyzing the parametric behavior of complex/multiscale epidemic simulators much more efficiently than simply simulating forward in time. It is shown how steady state and (if required) time-dependent computations, stability computations, as well as continuation and numerical bifurcation analysis can be performed in a straightforward manner. The approach is illustrated through a simple individual-based SIRS epidemic model deploying on a random regular connected graph. Using the individual-based simulator as a black box coarse-grained timestepper and with the aid of Simulated Annealing I compute the coarse-grained equilibrium bifurcation diagram and analyze the stability of the stationary states sidestepping the necessity of obtaining explicit closures at the macroscopic level. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

However, with regard to this objective, conventional estimation methods for discrete-time dynamical models are frequently found to be wanting. In fact, they are characteristically misguided in at least two respects: (i) assuming that there is a true model; (ii) evaluating the efficacy of the estimation as if the postulated model is true. There are numerous examples of models, when fitted by conventional methods, that fail to capture some of the most basic global features of the data, such as cycles with good matching periods, singularities of spectral density functions (especially at the origin) and others. We argue that the shortcomings need not always be due to the model formulation but the inadequacy of the conventional fitting methods. After all, all models are wrong, but some are useful if they are fitted properly. The practical issue becomes one of how to best fit the model to data. Thus, in the absence of a true model, we prefer an alternative approach to conventional model fitting that typically involves one-step-ahead prediction errors. Our primary aim is to match the joint probability distribution of the observable time series, including long-term features of the dynamics that underpin the data, such as cycles, long memory and others, rather than shortterm prediction. For want of a better name, we call this specific aim feature matching. The challenges of model misspecification, measurement errors and the scarcity of data are forever present in real time series modeling. In this paper, by synthesizing earlier attempts into an extended-likelihood, we develop a systematic approach to empirical time series analysis to address these challenges and to aim at achieving better feature matching. Rigorous proofs are included but relegated to the Appendix. Numerical results, based on both simulations and real data, suggest that the proposed catch-all approach has several advantages over the conventional methods, especially when the time series is short or with strong cyclical fluctuations. We conclude with listing directions that require further development.","ACF; Bayesian statistics; Black-box models; Blowflies; Box's dictum; Calibration; Catch-all approach; Data mining; Ecological populations; Epidemiology; Feature consistency; Feature matching; Least squares estimation; Maximum likelihood; Measles; Measurement errors; Misspecified models; Model averaging; Multi-step-ahead prediction; Nonlinear time series; Observation errors; Optimal parameter; Periodicity; Population models; Sea levels; Short time series; SIR epidemiological model; Skeleton; Substantive models; Sunspots; Threshold autoregressive models,Whittle's likelihood; XT-likelihood",,"Akaike, H., On the likelihood of a time series model (1978) The Statistician, 27, pp. 217-235; Alligood, K.T., Sauer, T.D., Yorke, J.A., (1997) Chaos: An Introduction to Dynamical Systems, , Springer, New York; Anderson, R.M., May, R.M., (1991) Infectious Diseases of Humans: Dynamics and Control, , Oxford Univ.

In this study, we tested whether time series analysis was useful for predicting the incidence of influenza in Japan. Methods The method of time series analysis we used consists of spectral analysis based on the maximum entropy method (MEM) in the frequency domain and the nonlinear least squares method in the time domain. Using this time series analysis, we analyzed the incidence data of influenza in Japan from January 1948 to December 1998; these data are unique in that they covered the periods of pandemics in Japan in 1957, 1968, and 1977. Results On the basis of the MEM spectral analysis, we identified the periodic modes explaining the underlying variations of the incidence data. The optimum least squares fitting (LSF) curve calculated with the periodic modes reproduced the underlying variation of the incidence data. An extension of the LSF curve could be used to predict the incidence of influenza quantitatively. Conclusions Our study suggested that MEM spectral analysis would allow us to model temporal variations of influenza epidemics with multiple periodic modes much more effectively than by using the method of conventional time series analysis, which has been used previously to investigate the behavior of temporal variations in influenza data. © The Japanese Society for Hygiene 2011.","Epidemiology; Influenza; Prediction analysis; Surveillance; Time series analysis","article; epidemic; incidence; influenza; Japan; maximum entropy method; prediction; regression analysis; spectroscopy; statistical analysis; time series analysis; Epidemics; Humans; Incidence; Influenza, Human; Japan; Least-Squares Analysis; Nonlinear Dynamics; Periodicity; Population Surveillance; Time Factors","Cliff, A., Haggett, P., Smallman-Raynor, M., An exploratory method for estimating the changing speed of epidemic waves from historical data (2008) Int J Epidemiol, 37, pp. 106-112; Surveillance, B.Pb., Evans, A.L., Brachman, P.S., (1991) Bacterial Infections of Humans: Epidemiology and Control, pp. 49-61. , 2nd ed.

While in the situation that epidemic pathway is defined by traffic flows, the epidemic spreading in networks with pronounced community structure is obviously accelerated instead. When it is extended to the SIS model with traffic flows, the epidemic threshold is found to be proportional to the inverse of the average betweenness.

However, there are many open questions regarding the intricate relationship between seasonality and the complex dynamics of infectious diseases it gives rise to. For example, in the analysis of long-term time-series of childhood diseases, it is not clear why there are transitions from regimes with regular annual dynamics, to regimes in which epidemics occur every two or more years, and vice-versa. The classical seasonally-forced SIR epidemic model gives insights into these phenomena but due to its intrinsic nonlinearity and complex dynamics, the model is rarely amenable to detailed mathematical analysis.Making sensible approximations we analytically study the threshold (bifurcation) point of the forced SIR model where there is a switch from annual to biennial epidemics. We derive, for the first time, a simple equation that predicts the relationship between key epidemiological parameters near the bifurcation point. The relationship makes clear that, for realistic values of the parameters, the transition from biennial to annual dynamics will occur if either the birth-rate (μ) or basic reproductive ratio (R 0) is increased sufficiently, or if the strength of seasonality (δ) is reduced sufficiently. These effects are confirmed in simulations studies and are also in accord with empirical observations. For example, the relationship may explain the correspondence between documented transitions in measles epidemics dynamics and concomitant changes in demographic and environmental factors. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Infectious diseases; Nonlinear dynamics; Seasonal epidemics; SIR model","disease transmission; epidemic; epidemiology; infectious disease; long-term change; numerical model; periodicity; seasonality; spatiotemporal analysis; time series analysis; analytical parameters; article; birth rate; dynamics; epidemic; epidemiological parameter; mathematical analysis; medical parameters; observation; periodicity; prediction; priority journal; reproduction; seasonal variation; simulation; statistical model; Basic Reproduction Number; Birth Rate; Communicable Diseases; Epidemics; Humans; Models, Biological; Nonlinear Dynamics; Periodicity; Seasons","Altizer, S., Dobson, A., Hosseini, P., Hudson, P., Pascual, M., Rohani, P., Seasonality and the dynamics of infectious diseases (2006) Ecol.

We take the classical stochastic SIR model as a case study. Using the inverse-size expansion of van Kampen we obtain approximations for the first and second moments of the state variables. These approximate moments are in turn matched to the moments of an inputed Generic Discrete distribution aimed at generating an approximate likelihood that is valid both for low count or high count data. We conduct a full Bayesian inference using informative priors.

Identifying the climatic triggers that increase malaria risk affords a basis for developing environmentally-driven early warning systems. Satellite remote sensing provides a wide range of environmental metrics that are sensitive to temperature, rainfall, and other climatic variables. The goals of this study were to develop a computer application for automatically acquiring and processing remote sensing data, and to test the utility of these data for modelling and forecasting malaria epidemics in the Amhara region of Ethiopia. The application was programmed using JAVA for user interface development and overall system control. Spatial analyses were carried out using Python scripts to call ArcGIS geoprocessing functions, and PostgreSQL was used to store and manipulate the resulting data summaries. Remotely-sensed variables included land surface temperature from MODIS/Terra, vegetation indices computed using MODIS nadir BRDF-adjusted reflectance, precipitation estimates from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission, and actual evapotranspiration modelled using the simplified surface energy balance method. Historical remote sensing data from 2000-2010 were summarized at the district level by 8-day MODIS composite periods and transformed to deviations from their 11-year means. Time series of monthly malaria outpatient cases were collected for 19 districts in the Amhara region and used to compute risk indices for the main epidemic season from September- December. Malaria epidemics during this season were associated with a higherthan- normal number of malaria cases in May-June, higher-than normal rainfall in January-May, and warmer-than-normal temperatures in May-June. A crossvalidated statistical model containing these variables predicted more than 50% of the variability in malaria relative risk. Continued environmental monitoring using satellite remote sensing will allow us to forecast the environmental risk of malaria epidemics in future years and validate these initial results.","Early warning; Geoinformatics; Malaria; Remote sensing",,"Abeku, T.A., Response to malaria epidemics in Africa (2007) Emerging Infectious Diseases, 13, pp. 681-686; DaSilva, J., Garanganga, B., Teveredzi, V., Marx, S.M., Mason, S.J., Connor, S.J., Improving epidemic malaria planning, preparedness and response in Southern Africa (2004) Malaria Journal, 3, p. 37; Ford, T.E., Colwell, R.R., Rose, J.B., Morse, S.S., Rogers, D.J., Yates, T.L., Using satellite images of environmental changes to predict infectious disease outbreaks (2009) Emerging Infectious Diseases, 15, pp. 1341-1346; Guintran, J., Delacollette, C., Trigg, P., (2006) Systems for the Early Detection of Malaria Epidemics in Africa: An Analysis of Current Practices and Future Priorities, , WHO/HTM/MAL/2006.1115, World Health Organization, Geneva; (2012) R Development Core Team, R: A Language and Environment for Statistical Computing, R Foundation for Statistical Computing, , Vienna, Austria; Rop, M., Liu, Y., Wimberly, M.C., FWA - A framework for developing web- Atlas applications (2011) Proceedings of the 2011 International Conference on Software Engineering Research and Practice (SERP'11), , Las Vegas, NV, July 18-21; Senay, G.B., Buddle, M., Verdin, J.P., Melesse, A.M., A coupled remote sensing and simplified surface energy balance approach to estimate actual evapotranspiration from irrigated field (2007) Sensors, 7, pp. 979-1000; Senay, G.B., Budde, M.E., Verdin, J.P., Enhancing the simplified surface energy balance (SSEB) approach for estimating landscape ET: Validation with the METRIC model (2011) Agricultural Water Management, 98, pp. 606-618; Thomson, M.C., Connor, S.J., The development of malaria early warning systems for Africa (2001) TRENDS in Parasitology, 17, pp. 438-445","iEMSs - Managing Resour.

Previous work, based on the standard seasonally forced 'susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed' (SEIR) model has found that transitions in the dynamics of many childhood diseases result from bifurcations induced by slow changes in birth and vaccination rates. However, the standard SEIR formulation assumes that the stage durations (latent and infectious periods) are exponentially distributed, whereas real distributions are narrower and centred around the mean. Much recent work has indicated that realistically distributed stage durations strongly affect the dynamical structure of seasonally forced epidemic models. We investigate whether inferences drawn from previous analyses of transitions in patterns of measles dynamics are robust to the shapes of the stage duration distributions. As an illustrative example, we analyse measles dynamics in New York City from 1928 to 1972. We find that with a fixed mean infectious period in the susceptible-infectious-removed (SIR) model, the dynamical structure and predicted transitions vary substantially as a function of the shape of the infectious period distribution. By contrast, with fixed mean latent and infectious periods in the SEIR model, the shapes of the stage duration distributions have a less dramatic effect on model dynamical structure and predicted transitions. All these results can be understood more easily by considering the distribution of the disease generation time as opposed to the distributions of individual disease stages. Numerical bifurcation analysis reveals that for a given mean generation time the dynamics of the SIR and SEIR models for measles are nearly equivalent and are insensitive to the shapes of the disease stage distributions. © 2013 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

A SIRS model based on ordinary differential equations has also been proposed to describe RSV dynamics in the region of Valencia. However, this continuous-time deterministic model is not suitable when the initial number of infected individuals is small. Stochastic epidemic models based on a probability of disease transmission provide a more natural description of the spread of infectious diseases. In addition, by allowing the transmission rate to vary stochastically over time, the proposed model provides an improved description of RSV dynamics. The Bayesian analysis of the model allows us to calculate both the posterior distribution of the model parameters and the posterior predictive distribution, which facilitates the computation of point forecasts and prediction intervals for future observations. © 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Researchers recently have tried to develop mathematical models to predict the epidemic of infectious diseases. However, with the development of ground transportation system in modern society, the spread of infectious diseases became faster and more complicated in terms of the speed and the pathways. The route of infectious diseases during Vancouver Olympics was predicted based on the Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) model. In this model only the air traffic as an essential factor for the intercity migration of infectious diseases was involved. Here, we propose a multi-city transmission model to predict the infection route during 2018 Winter Olympics in Korea based on the pre-existing SIR model. Various types of transportation system such as a train, a car, a bus, and an airplane for the interpersonal contact in both inter- and intra-city are considered. Simulation is performed with assumptions and scenarios based on realistic factors including demographic, transportation and diseases data in Korea. Finally, we analyze an economic profit and loss caused by the variation of the number of tourists during the Olympics. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Forecasting; Integrated circuits; Transportation; Viruses; Air traffics; Economic profit; Ground transportation systems; Infectious disease; Route predictions; SIR model; Transmission model; Transportation system; Diseases","Longini Jr., I.M., (2005) Science, 309 (5737), p. 1083. , 10.1126/science.1115717 0036-8075; Carrat, F., Luong, J., Lao, H., (2006) BMG Med, 4 (1), p. 1. , 10.1186/1741-7015-4-1 1741-7015; Fulford, G.R., Barnes, B., (2009) Taylor & Francis Group, p. 95; Hyman, J.M., Laforce, Banks, T.H., Castillo-Chavez, C., (2003) Bioterrorism, p. 215; Kermack, W.O., McKendrick, A.H., (1991) Bull.

By applying these methods to the SARS case, we have found that the ensemble method works well as a PoP method.","Decay function; Ensemble method; Generalized logistic distribution; L-plot; Ordinary differential equation model; Pandemic; PoP; Restricted RMSE; SIR model; Statistical truncated model","Exponential functions; Ordinary differential equations; Decay function; Ensemble methods; Generalized logistic distributions; L-plot; Ordinary differential equation models; Pandemic; PoP; Restricted RMSE; SIR model; Forecasting","Anderson, R., May, R., Infectious diseases of humans: Dynamics and control (1991), Oxford University Press; Hirose, H., The mixed trunsored model with applications to SARS (2007) Mathematics and Computers in Simulation, 74, pp. 443-453; Hirose, H., Estimation of the number of failures in the Weibull model using the ordinary differential equation (2012) European Journal of Operational Research, 223 (3), pp. 722-731; Hirose, H., Pandemic Simulations by MADE: A combination of Multiagent and Differential Equations, with Novel Influenza A(H1N1) (2013) Information, 16 (7 B), pp. 5365-5390; Hirose, H., The trunsored model and its applications to lifetime analysis: unified censored and truncated models (2005) IEEE Transactions on Reliability, 54, pp. 11-21; Hirose, H., The mixed trunsored model with applications to SARS (2007) Mathematics and Computers in Simulation, 74, pp. 443-453; Hirose, H., Matsukuma, K., Sakumura, T., Infectious disease spread prediction models and consideration (2010), pp. 1-6. , IPSJ SIG Technical Report 2010-MPS-81 15; Hirose, H., Estimation for the size of fragile population in the trunsored and truncated models with application to the confidence interval for the case fatality ratio of SARS (2009) Information, 12 (1), pp. 33-50; Hirose, H., The mixed trunsored model with applications to SARS (2007) Mathematics and Computers in Simulation, 72 (6), pp. 443-453; Hirose, H., Koyanagi, Y., Prediction on Predictions by Ensemble Method (2014), pp. 1204-1208. , Lecture Notes in Engineering and Computer Science: Proceedings of The International MultiConference of Engineers and Computer Scientists 2014, IMECS 2014, 12-14 March Hong Kong; Kermack, W.O., McKendrick, A.G., Contributions to the mathematical theory of epidemics-iii. further studies of the problem of endemicity (1933) Proceedings of the Royal Society, 141 A, pp. 94-122; Donnelly, C.A., Epidemiological determinants of spread of causal agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome in Hong Kong (2003) The Lancet, 361 (9371), pp. 1761-1766; Nelder, J.A., Mead, R., A simplex method for function minimization (1965) The Computer Journal, 7, pp. 308-313; Toyosaka, Y., Hirose, H., The consistency of the pandemic simulations between the SEIR model and the MAS model (2009) IEICE Transactions on Fundamentals, E92-A (7), pp. 1558-1562; Zaman, F., Hirose, H., Classification Performance of Bagging and Boosting Type Ensemble Methods with Small Training Sets (2011) New Generation Computing, special issue on Hybrid and Ensemble Methods in Machine Learning, 29 (3), pp. 277-292","IAENG Int.

This study proposes a stochastic framework to integrate space-time dynamics in the form of a Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model, together with uncertain disease observations, into a Bayesian maximum entropy (BME) framework. The resulting model (BME-SIR) can be used to predict space-time disease spread. Specifically, it was applied to obtain a space-time prediction of the dengue fever (DF) epidemic that took place in Kaohsiung City (Taiwan) during 2002. In implementing the model, the SIR parameters were continually updated and information on new cases of infection was incorporated. The results obtained show that the proposed model is rigorous to user-specified initial values of unknown model parameters, that is, transmission and recovery rates. In general, this model provides a good characterization of the spatial diffusion of the DF epidemic, especially in the city districts proximal to the location of the outbreak. Prediction performance may be affected by various factors, such as virus serotypes and human intervention, which can change the space-time dynamics of disease diffusion. The proposed BME-SIR disease prediction model can provide government agencies with a valuable reference for the timely identification, control, and prevention of DF spread in space and time. © 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The positivity and boundedness are studied firstly. The locally asymptotical stability of the disease-free equilibrium and endemic equilibrium is studied in succession. And then, the conditions on which periodic orbits bifurcate are given. Furthermore, we show that the local Hopf bifurcation implies the global Hopf bifurcation after the second critical value of the delay. The obtained results show that the time delay in media coverage can not affect the stability of the disease-free equilibrium when the basic reproduction number R0<1. However, when R0>1, the stability of the endemic equilibrium will be affected by the time delay; there will be a family of periodic orbits bifurcating from the endemic equilibrium when the time delay increases through a critical value. Finally, some examples for numerical simulations are also included. © 2014 Huitao Zhao et al.",,"algorithm; article; basic reproduction number; compartment model; epidemic; human; mass medium; mathematical model;

This paper reviews methods for influenza forecasting proposed during previous influenza outbreaks and those evaluated in hindsight. We discuss the various approaches, in addition to the variability in measures of accuracy and precision of predicted measures. PubMed and Google Scholar searches for articles on influenza forecasting retrieved sixteen studies that matched the study criteria. We focused on studies that aimed at forecasting influenza outbreaks at the local, regional, national, or global level. The selected studies spanned a wide range of regions including USA, Sweden, Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore, United Kingdom, Canada, France, and Cuba. The methods were also applied to forecast a single measure or multiple measures. Typical measures predicted included peak timing, peak height, daily/weekly case counts, and outbreak magnitude. Due to differences in measures used to assess accuracy, a single estimate of predictive error for each of the measures was difficult to obtain. However, collectively, the results suggest that these diverse approaches to influenza forecasting are capable of capturing specific outbreak measures with some degree of accuracy given reliable data and correct disease assumptions. Nonetheless, several of these approaches need to be evaluated and their performance quantified in real-time predictions. © 2013 The Authors.

A forecasting system has been designed and developed using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). It is a novel research as a novel dataset has been exploited. The data are categorized in two groups of climatic parameters (temperature, humidity, precipitation, wind speed & sea level pressure) and number of patients (number of total referrals and number of patients with Influenza-Like Illnesses (ILI)).

These methods have found application in a range of disciplines and settings, including engineering design and forecasting, and, over the last two decades, have been applied to infectious disease epidemiology. For any system of interest, the ideal filter depends on the nonlinearity and complexity of the model to which it is applied, the quality and abundance of observations being entrained, and the ultimate application (e.g. forecast, parameter estimation, etc.). Here, we compare the performance of six state-of-the-art filter methods when used to model and forecast influenza activity. Three particle filters-a basic particle filter (PF) with resampling and regularization, maximum likelihood estimation via iterated filtering (MIF), and particle Markov chain Monte Carlo (pMCMC)-and three ensemble filters-the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF), the ensemble adjustment Kalman filter (EAKF), and the rank histogram filter (RHF)-were used in conjunction with a humidity-forced susceptible-infectious-recovered-susceptible (SIRS) model and weekly estimates of influenza incidence. The modeling frameworks, first validated with synthetic influenza epidemic data, were then applied to fit and retrospectively forecast the historical incidence time series of seven influenza epidemics during 2003-2012, for 115 cities in the United States. Results suggest that when using the SIRS model the ensemble filters and the basic PF are more capable of faithfully recreating historical influenza incidence time series, while the MIF and pMCMC do not perform as well for multimodal outbreaks. For forecast of the week with the highest influenza activity, the accuracies of the six model-filter frameworks are comparable; the three particle filters perform slightly better predicting peaks 1-5 weeks in the future; the ensemble filters are more accurate predicting peaks in the past. © 2014 Yang et al.",,"analytical error; article; disease activity; ensemble adjustment Kalman filter; ensemble Kalman filter; epidemic; filtration; incidence; influenza; intermethod comparison; iterated filtering; measurement accuracy; model; particle filter; particle Markov chain Monte Carlo; particulate matter; prediction and forecasting; prevalence; rank histogram filter; susceptible infectious recovered susceptible model; time series analysis; validation process; comparative study; epidemiology; forecasting; human; Influenza, Human; retrospective study; theoretical model; United States; validation study; Forecasting; Humans; Influenza, Human; Models, Theoretical; Retrospective Studies; United States","Molinari, N.-A.M., Ortega-Sanchez, I.R., Messonnier, M.L., Thompson, W.W., Wortley, P.M., The annual impact of seasonal influenza in the US: Measuring disease burden and costs (2007) Vaccine, 25, pp. 5086-5096; Ong, J.B., Chen, M.I., Cook, A.R., Lee, H.C., Lee, V.J., Real-time epidemic monitoring and forecasting of H1N1-2009 using influenza-like illness from general practice and family doctor clinics in Singapore (2010) PLoS One, 5, pp. e10036; Dukic, V., Lopes, H.F., Polson, N.G., Tracking epidemics with google flu trends data and a state-space SEIR model (2012) Journal of the American Statistical Association, 107, pp. 1410-1426; Shaman, J., Karspeck, A., Forecasting seasonal outbreaks of influenza (2012) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 109, pp. 20425-20430; Skvortsov, A., Ristic, B., Monitoring and prediction of an epidemic outbreak using syndromic observations (2012) Mathematical Biosciences, 240, pp. 12-19; Shaman, J., Karspeck, A., Lipsitch, M., (2013) Week 1 Influenza Forecast for the 2012-2013 US Season, , arXiv: 1301.3110; Shaman, J., Karspeck, A., Yang, W., Tamerius, J., Lipsitch, M., Real-time influenza forecasts during the 2012-2013 season (2013) Nat Commun, 4, p. 2837; (2013) FluView, , http://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; Goldstein, E., Cobey, S., Takahashi, S., Miller, J.C., Lipsitch, M., Predicting the Epidemic Sizes of Influenza A/H1N1, A/H3N2, and B: A Statistical Method (2011) PLoS Med, 8, pp. e1001051; (2013) Google Flu Trend, , http://www.google.org/flutrends, Google.org; Shaman, J., Pitzer, V.E., Viboud, C., Grenfell, B.T., Lipsitch, M., Absolute Humidity and the Seasonal Onset of Influenza in the Continental United States (2010) PLoS Biol, 8, pp. e1000316; Shaman, J., Kohn, M., Absolute humidity modulates influenza survival, transmission, and seasonality (2009) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 106, pp. 3243-3248; Anderson, J.L., A non-Gaussian ensemble filter update for data assimilation (2010) Mon Weather Rev, 138, pp. 4186-4198; Evensen, G., (2008) Sequential data assimilation.

In epidemiological surveillance, the problem is compounded by the fact that infectious diseases models (such as susceptible-infected-recovered-susceptible, SIRS) are very sensitive to current conditions, such that small changes can produce remarkable differences in future outcomes. Unfortunately, current or nearly-current conditions keep changing as data are collected and updated by the epidemiological surveillance organizations. In this paper we show that the time series of Twitter messages reporting a combination of symptoms that match the influenza-like-illness (ILI) case definition represent a more stable and reliable information on ""current conditions"", to the point that they can replace, rather than simply integrate, official epidemiological data. We estimate the effectiveness of these data at predicting current and past flu seasons (17 seasons overall), in combination with official historical data on past seasons, obtaining an average correlation of 0.85 over a period of 17 weeks covering the flu season. © 2014 Springer International Publishing.","epidemiological surveillance; predictability of health-related phenomena; Twitter mining","Information science; Monitoring; Social networking (online); Flu epidemics; Historical data; Infectious disease; predictability of health-related phenomena; Predicting currents; Prediction model; Social datum; Health","Yu, S., Kak, S., (2012) A Survey of Prediction Using Social Media, , http://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1203/1203.1647.pdf, retrieved; Asur, S., Huberman, B.H., Predicting the Future with Social Media, , http://www.hpl.hp.com/research/scl/papers/socialmedia/socialmedia.pdf, retrieved; Radinsky, K., Horvitz, E., Mining the web to predict future events (2013) WSDM 2013, pp. 255-264; Ruiz, E.J., Hristidis, V., Castillo, C., Gionis, A., Jaimes, A., Correlating financial time series with micro-blogging activity (2012) Proceedings of the Fifth ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining, WSDM 2012, pp. 513-522. , ACM, New York; Carrifere-Swallow, Y., Labbfe, F., (2010) Nowcasting with Google Trends in An Emerging Market, (588). , Central Bank of Chile, Working Papers; Ginsberg, J., Mohebbi, M.H., Patel, R.S., Brammer, L., Smolinski, M.S., Detecting influenza epidemics using search engine query data (2009) Nature, 457, pp. 1012-1014; Althouse, B.M., Ng, Y.Y., Cummings, D.A.T., Prediction of Dengue Incidence Using Search Query Surveillance (2011) PLoS Negl.

These models are extended by including a random rewiring of susceptible individuals from infectious (and exposed) neighbours. The derived relationship between the exponential growth rate and R0 appears as formally consistent with those derived from homogeneous mixing models, enabling us to measure the transmission potential using the early growth rate of cases. On the other hand, the algebraic expression of R0 for the SEIR pairwise model shows that its value is affected by the average duration of the latent period, in contrast to what happens for the homogeneous mixing SEIR model. Numerical simulations on complex contact networks are performed to check the analytical assumptions and predictions. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Basic reproduction number; Initial epidemic growth rate; Pairwise epidemic models; SEIR model","epidemic; growth rate; homogeneous medium; numerical model; theoretical study; article; attitude to health; basic reproduction number; correlation analysis; disease duration; disease predisposition; disease transmission; epidemic; growth rate; human; mathematics; neighborhood; pairwise model; population dynamics; prediction; priority journal; statistical model; susceptible exposed infectious recovered model; susceptible infected susceptible model; Susceptible Infectious Recovered model; susceptible population; virus latency; biological model; epidemiology; Disease Susceptibility; Epidemiologic Studies; Humans; Models, Biological","Anderson, R.M., May, R.M., (1991) Infectious Diseases of Humans: Dynamics and Control, , Oxford University Press, USA; Bansal, S., Grenfell, B.T., Meyers, L.A., When individual behaviour matters. homogeneous and networks models in epidemiology (2007) J.

Recently, the world medical association has announced that their new medicine could stop Ebola and cure patients whose disease is not advanced. Aiming at the three countries where the epidemic is most serious, we develop mathematical models to make arrangements for the plans of the medicine. For the quantity of the medicine needed, we find it is related to the spread of Ebola. To estimate the spread of Ebola, we introduce the SI model .With the collection of the historical data and linear fitting, we study the development of the disease before the medicine is used. In order to predict the quantity of the patients after the medicine is used, we improve the SI model into the SIR model. According to the change of the quantity of the patients, we divide the treatment into two sections and calculate the quantity of the medicine in section 1 is 1207591 units, while it is 11611 units in section 2. Based on the quantity of the medicine needed and the shelf life of the medicine in Western Africa, we plan the speed of manufacturing the medicine rationally. Our model is not only easy to be understood, but also with novelty. Moreover, our model can be applied to other situations with a simple change of parameters. Compared with other models which make plenty of assumptions, our model is objective and reasonable based on the realistic data.","SI SIR mathematical model linear fitting","Disease control; Patient treatment; Project management; Forecast and analysis; Historical data; Linear fitting; Shelf life; Si models; SIR model; Two section; Diseases","Jiang, Q., Xie, J., Ye, J., (2010) Mathematical Model, 4th Edition, pp. 136-140; (2015) 2014 Eola Outbreak in West Africa-Reported Cases Graphs, , http://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/outbreaks/2014-west-adrica/cumulative-cases-graphs.html, Feb 4th; Zheng, C., (2014) Ebola Virus with Twenty Percent of the Infection Will Probably Invade the USA at the End of October, , http://blog.sina.com.cn/s/blog_4c37ab0c0102v9iu.html, At Most 28 Million People Will Be Infected at the End of the Year, Sep 16th","Conf.

The Japanese infectious disease surveillance scheme was established to detect infectious disease outbreaks during their early stages. Under this scheme, incident reports on infectious diseases are collected from 47 prefectures in Japan. However, publication of aggregate reports based on the scheme is delayed by about 2 weeks after data collection. Alternative data sources and real-time tools to monitor infectious disease are therefore required. We investigated whether websites operated by Twitter and local newspapers are promising data sources for monitoring the incidence of influenza. It was found that the Twitter corpus is a promising data source for monitoring national morbidity of influenza, and content from the websites of many local newspapers seems to reflect current local influenza morbidity. We then performed a time series analysis to construct a suitable model for predicting future morbidity. As the result of time series analyses, the nearest neighbor method, which used together Internet-based data with retrospective Japanese infectious disease surveillance data, was found to yield the best fit predictions. The obtained suitable model for predicting future morbidity had been made available on our website, which presents sophisticated visualizations for users to easily ascertain future morbidity. The site can also help medical personnel quickly ascertain trends in infectious diseases morbidity and warn the general population of impending outbreaks of diseases. © 2015.","Influenza; Predicting future epidemics; Twitter; Web-based data","Data acquisition; Forecasting; Harmonic analysis; Information management; Internet; Monitoring; Network security; Newsprint; Risk management; Social networking (online); Time series analysis; Viruses; Websites; Infectious disease; Infectious disease outbreaks; Influenza; Nearest neighbor method; Predicting future epidemics; Twitter; Web based; Web based information systems; Diseases","Ginsberg, J., Detecting influenza epidemics using search engine query data (2009) Nature, 19 (7232), pp. 1012-1014. , 457; Lampos, V., Flu Detector - Tracking Epidemics on Twitter (2010) Machine Learning and Knowledge Discovery in Databases, 6223, pp. 599-602; Masashi, I., Reducing of a Web-based Data Visualization System for Comprehensible Ascertainment of the Spatiotemporal Extent of Infectious Diseases (2013) Japan Journal of Medical Informatics, 33, pp. 27-32","Proc.

The dynamics of the agent-based simulator evolve on small-world transmission networks of sizes equal to the population of each country, with adjustable densities to account for the effects of public health intervention policies and individual behavioral responses to the evolving epidemic. Based on time series of the official case counts from the World Health Organization (WHO), we provide estimates for key epidemiological variables by employing the so-called Equation-Free approach. The underlying transmission networks were characterized by rather random structures in the two countries with densities decreasing by ~19% from the early (May 27-early August) to the last period (mid October-December 21). Our estimates for the values of key epidemiological variables, such as the mean time to death, recovery and the case fatality rate, are very close to the ones reported by the WHO Ebola response team during the early period of the epidemic (until September 14) that were calculated based on clinical data. Specifically, regarding the effective reproductive number Re, our analysis suggests that until mid October, Re was above 2.3 in both countries; from mid October to December 21, Re dropped well below unity in Liberia, indicating a saturation of the epidemic, while in Sierra Leone it was around 1.9, indicating an ongoing epidemic. Accordingly, a ten-week projection from December 21 estimated that the epidemic will fade out in Liberia in early March; in contrast, our results flashed a note of caution for Sierra Leone since the cumulative number of cases could reach as high as 18,000, and the number of deaths might exceed 5,000, by early March 2015. However, by processing the reported data of the very last period (December 21, 2014-January 18, 2015), we obtained more optimistic estimates indicative of a remission of the epidemic in Sierra Leone, as reflected by the derived Re (~0.82, 95% CI: 0.81-0.83). © 2015, Public Library of Science.

This approach was successfully used in USSR by Baroyan and Rvachev to predict flu outbreaks throughout 1970's. However, in early 1980's it became increasingly inaccurate and due to that the approach was not applied since. Our aim is to find out, using the long-term data on acute respiratory infections incidence for Moscow, Saint Petersburg and Novosibirsk as an input, to what extent this method of outbreak peak prediction is applicable nowadays, and discuss the methods of increasing its accuracy. We found that SEIR population modeling is still valid for prediction of peak heights, but not peak days. © 2016 The Authors.

Continued surveillance activities are recommended in the post pandemic phase to watch over the trend, severity and impact of Influenza like illnesses (ILI). Aims This study aimed to document the epidemiological profile of lab positive H1N1 cases in post pandemic period from August 2010-December 2014 in nodal H1N1 surveillance centre of Puducherry. Methods The study analysed secondary data collected during the period August 10, 2010 to Dec 2014 from ILI suspects attending a tertiary care hospital, for the Integrated Disease Surveillance Project (IDSP). Demographic details, lab positivity based on Real-time PCR technique for H1N1, clinical symptoms and outcomes were extracted. Data were analysed using STATA version 11.0. Independent predictors of lab positivity rate were identified using logistic regression analysis. Time trend of frequency of suspected cases and lab positivity rate were performed using time series plots. Results A total of 2065 suspected cases were reported, of whom 197 cases were positive for H1N1 (lab positivity rate 9.5 per cent). Being an adult (OR: 1.6; 95 per cent CI: 1.1-2.3; p=0.02), management in in-patient settings (OR: 2.5; 95 per cent CI: 1.3-4.7; p=0.001), history of contact (OR: 2.7; 95 per cent CI: 1.5-4.5; p=0.0001) and history of travel (OR: 2.3; 95 per cent CI: 1.2-4.3; p=0.01) were the independent predictors for lab positivity. Death rate among lab confirmed cases was found to be 9.6 per cent. After 2012, the trend of laboratory confirmed H1N1 cases became a plateau. One needs to screen 35 suspected cases to capture one lab confirmed case of H1N1 in 2014. Conclusion Lab positivity was seen among 9.5 per cent of cases and the independent predictors were severe cases, adult patients, positive history of contact and travel. The number needed to screen to get one lab positive H1N1 case is 35 suspected cases. © 2016, Australasian Medical Journal Pty Ltd.

We focus on whether or not a major outbreak (i.e. an epidemic that will go on to infect a large number of individuals) can be predicted reliably soon after initial cases of disease have appeared within a population. For emerging epidemics, significant time and effort is spent recording symptomatic cases. Scientific attention has often focused on improving statistical methodologies to estimate disease transmission parameters from these data. Here we show that, even if symptomatic cases are recorded perfectly, and disease spread parameters are estimated exactly, it is impossible to estimate the probability of a major outbreak without ambiguity. Our results therefore provide an upper bound on the accuracy of forecasts of major outbreaks that are constructed using data on symptomatic cases alone. Accurate prediction of whether or not an epidemic will occur requires records of symptomatic individuals to be supplemented with data concerning the true infection status of apparently uninfected individuals. To forecast likely future behavior in the earliest stages of an emerging outbreak, it is therefore vital to develop and deploy accurate diagnostic tests that can determine whether asymptomatic individuals are actually uninfected, or instead are infected but just do not yet show detectable symptoms. © 2016 Thompson et al.",,"Article; calculation; compartment model; controlled study; diagnostic test; Ebola hemorrhagic fever; epidemic; incubation time; infection; mathematical analysis; mathematical computing; measurement accuracy; plots and curves; prediction and forecasting; presymptomatic infection; probability; SEIR model; simulation; stochastic model; Uganda; uncertainty; virus transmission; biological model; biology; Communicable Diseases, Emerging; early diagnosis; epidemic; forecasting; Hemorrhagic Fever, Ebola; human; Markov chain; procedures; statistical model; statistics and numerical data; Communicable Diseases, Emerging; Computational Biology; Diagnostic Tests, Routine; Disease Outbreaks; Early Diagnosis; Epidemics; Forecasting; Hemorrhagic Fever, Ebola; Humans; Models, Biological; Models, Statistical; Probability; Stochastic Processes","Matthews, L., Woolhouse, M., New approaches to quantifying the spread of infection (2005) Nature Rev Microbiol, 3, pp. 529-536. , .;:–; Woolhouse, M., How to make predictions about future infectious disease risks (2011) Phil Trans Roy Soc B, 366, pp. 2045-2054. , .;:–; Tildesley, M.J., Keeling, M.J., Is R0 a good predictor of final epidemic size: Foot-and-mouth disease in the UK (2009) J Theor Biol, 258, pp. 623-629. , 10.1016/j.jtbi.2009.02.019, 19269297, .;:–; Anderson, R.M., May, R.M., (1992) Infectious Diseases of Humans: Dynamics and Control, , .,;; Keeling, M.J., Rohani, P., (2008) Modelling Infectious Diseases in Humans and Animals, , .;; Anderson, D., Watson, R., On the spread of a disease with gamma distributed latent and infectious periods (1980) Biometrika, 67, pp. 191-198. , .;:–; Craft, M.E., Beyer, H.L., Haydon, D.T., Estimating the probability of a major outbreak from the timing of early cases: an indeterminate problem?

Methods: We investigated the effects of some model-building choices (targets, pace, coverage rate) on the results of SEIR models in the case of vaccination against varicella and herpes zoster. Results: The analysis demonstrated the need for a progressive unvaccinated to vaccinated transition and a dynamic system-equilibrium before vaccination onset. When several doses are considered, new compartments are needed to account for vaccination histories. For varicella, the delay to reach the expected coverage rate and the pace until reaching this rate have significant impacts, especially on the short-term incidence. The impact of vaccination through herd immunity should be systematically investigated. Conclusions: Graphs help understanding the progress of instantaneous incidence; however, tables of cumulative average incidence over decades should be preferred because of higher stability. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","herpes zoster; immunization strategy; prediction; SEIR models; vaccination modeling; varicella","chickenpox vaccine; varicella zoster vaccine; chickenpox vaccine; varicella zoster vaccine; Article; chickenpox; clinical assessment; clinical evaluation; compartment model; controlled study; health program; herd immunity; herpes zoster; human; incidence; long term care; managed care; medical history; outcome assessment; priority journal; public health campaign; short course therapy; strategic planning; susceptible exposed infected and recovered model; treatment failure; vaccination; Varicella zoster virus; adolescent; adult; chickenpox; child; female; herpes zoster; immunology; infant; male; middle aged; preschool child; preventive health service; statistical model; time; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Chickenpox; Chickenpox Vaccine; Child; Child, Preschool; Female; Herpes Zoster; Herpes Zoster Vaccine; Humans; Immunization Programs; Infant; Male; Middle Aged; Models, Statistical; Time; Young Adult","Anderson, R.M., May, R.M., (1991) Infectious diseases of humans: dynamics and control, , Oxford: Oxford University Press; Newall, A.T., Dehollain, J.P., Wood, J.G., Under-explored assumptions in influenza vaccination models: implications for the universal vaccination of children (2012) Vaccine, 30, pp. 5776-5781; Buonomo, B., A simple analysis of vaccination strategies for rubella (2011) Math Biosci Eng, 8, pp. 677-687; Huang, S.-Z., A new SEIR epidemic model with applications to the theory of eradication and control of diseases, and to the calculation of R0 (2008) Math Biosci, 215, pp. 84-104; Chen, S.C., Chang, C.F., Jou, L.J., Modelling vaccination programmes against measles in Taiwan (2007) Epidemiol Infect, 135, pp. 775-786; Halloran, M.E., Haber, M.J., Longini, I.M., Direct and indirect effects in vaccine efficacy and effectiveness (1991) Am J Epidemiol, 133, pp. 323-331; Matrajt, L., Jr., Longini, I.M., Optimizing vaccine allocation at different points in time during an epidemic (2010) PLoS One, 5, p. e13767; Brisson, M., Melkonyan, G., Drolet, M., Modeling the impact of one- and two-dose varicella vaccination on the epidemiology of varicella and zoster (2010) Vaccine, 28, pp. 3385-3397; Andrei, G., Snoeck, R., Advances in the treatment of varicella-zoster virus infections (2013) Adv Pharmacol, 67, pp. 107-168; Oxman, M.N., Zoster vaccine: current status and future prospects (2010) Clin Infect Dis, 51, pp. 197-213; Thomas, S.L., Wheeler, J.G., Hall, A.J., Contacts with varicella or with children and protection against herpes zoster in adults: a case-control study (2002) Lancet, 360, pp. 678-682; Hope-Simpson, R.E., The nature of herpes zoster: a long-term study and a new hypothesis (1965) Proc R Soc Med, 58, pp. 9-20; Reynolds, M.A., Chaves, S.S., Harpaz, R., The impact of the varicella vaccination program on herpes zoster epidemiology in the United States: a review (2008) J Infect Dis, 197, pp. S224-S227; Oxman, M.N., (Immunization to reduce the frequency and severity of herpes zoster and its complications (1995) Neurology, 45, pp. S41-S46; Gao, Z., Wood, J.G., Gidding, H.F., Control of varicella in the post-vaccination era in Australia: a model-based assessment of catch-up and infant vaccination strategies for the future (2015) Epidemiol Infect, 143, pp. 1467-1476; Lian, I.-B., Chien, Y.-Z., Hsu, P.-S., The changing epidemiology of varicella incidence after implementation of the one-dose varicella vaccination policy (2011) Vaccine, 29, pp. 1448-1454; Poletti, P., Melegaro, A., Ajelli, M., Perspectives on the impact of varicella immunization on herpes zoster.

Chan School of Public Health, Boston, United States","Background: The recent Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in West Africa has spread wider than any previous human EVD epidemic. While individual-level risk factors that contribute to the spread of EVD have been studied, the population-level attributes of subnational regions associated with outbreak severity have not yet been considered. Methods: To investigate the area-level predictors of EVD dynamics, we integrated time series data on cumulative reported cases of EVD from the World Health Organization and covariate data from the Demographic and Health Surveys. We first estimated the early growth rates of epidemics in each second-level administrative district (ADM2) in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia using exponential, logistic and polynomial growth models. We then evaluated how these growth rates, as well as epidemic size within ADM2s, were ecologically associated with several demographic and socio-economic characteristics of the ADM2, using bivariate correlations and multivariable regression models. Results: The polynomial growth model appeared to best fit the ADM2 epidemic curves, displaying the lowest residual standard error. Each outcome was associated with various regional characteristics in bivariate models, however in stepwise multivariable models only mean education levels were consistently associated with a worse local epidemic. Discussion: By combining two common methods - estimation of epidemic parameters using mathematical models, and estimation of associations using ecological regression models - we identified some factors predicting rapid and severe EVD epidemics in West African subnational regions. While care should be taken interpreting such results as anything more than correlational, we suggest that our approach of using data sources that were publicly available in advance of the epidemic or in real-time provides an analytic framework that may assist countries in understanding the dynamics of future outbreaks as they occur. © 2016 Valeri et al.

This paper proposes a novel adaptive network fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) to overcome the aforementioned problem. In particular, we use incremental k-mean to pre-identify the number of nodes in the adaptive network. Each node includes a set of samples in a training set. For each sample, we identify a fuzzy value of the particular sample data belonging to each node in the network. The learning perceptron algorithm also investigates to adjust weights by learning from real output data. In this study, the novel ANFIS model is employed to the dengue prediction application as well as evaluates performance execution by a real dataset of dengue disease in Tien Giang, Vietnam. The result shows that our proposed model of ANFIS gets better accuracy in comparison with linear regression, multiple linear regression, time series and neural network. © 2017 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","Adaptive network fuzzy inference system; ANFIS; Epidemic prediction; K-mean clustering; Neural network; Perceptron","Forecasting; Fuzzy logic; Fuzzy neural networks; Fuzzy systems; K-means clustering; Linear regression; Multilayer neural networks; Neural networks; Adaptive network fuzzy inference systems; Adaptive networks; ANFIS; ANFIS model; K-mean clustering; Multiple linear regressions; Perceptron algorithms; Training sets; Fuzzy inference","Bottou, L., Bengio, Y., Convergence properties of the K-means algorithm (1995) Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 7; Bottou, L., Bengio, Y., Convergence properties of the Kmeans algorithm (1995) Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 7, pp. 585-592. , Tesauro, G., Touretzky, D. and Leen, T.

Challenges to the identification of nascent malaria epidemics include obtaining recent epidemiological surveillance data, spatially and temporally harmonizing this information with timely data on environmental precursors, applying models for early detection and early warning, and communicating results to public health officials. Automated web-based informatics systems can provide a solution to these problems, but their implementation in real-world settings has been limited. Methods: The Epidemic Prognosis Incorporating Disease and Environmental Monitoring for Integrated Assessment (EPIDEMIA) computer system was designed and implemented to integrate disease surveillance with environmental monitoring in support of operational malaria forecasting in the Amhara region of Ethiopia. A co-design workshop was held with computer scientists, epidemiological modelers, and public health partners to develop an initial list of system requirements. Subsequent updates to the system were based on feedback obtained from system evaluation workshops and assessments conducted by a steering committee of users in the public health sector. Results: The system integrated epidemiological data uploaded weekly by the Amhara Regional Health Bureau with remotely-sensed environmental data freely available from online archives. Environmental data were acquired and processed automatically by the EASTWeb software program. Additional software was developed to implement a public health interface for data upload and download, harmonize the epidemiological and environmental data into a unified database, automatically update time series forecasting models, and generate formatted reports. Reporting features included district-level control charts and maps summarizing epidemiological indicators of emerging malaria outbreaks, environmental risk factors, and forecasts of future malaria risk. Conclusions: Successful implementation and use of EPIDEMIA is an important step forward in the use of epidemiological and environmental informatics systems for malaria surveillance. Developing software to automate the workflow steps while remaining robust to continual changes in the input data streams was a key technical challenge. Continual stakeholder involvement throughout design, implementation, and operation has created a strong enabling environment that will facilitate the ongoing development, application, and testing of the system. © 2017 The Author(s).","Early detection; Early warning; Environmental data; Forecasting; Malaria informatics system; Remote sensing; Risk map; Surveillance","access to information; Article; computer interface; computer system; controlled study; data base; disease surveillance; environmental factor; environmental monitoring; epidemic; epidemiological data; Ethiopia; health survey; human; infection risk; information processing; information retrieval; malaria; nonhuman; online system; prediction and forecasting; public health; risk factor; software; system analysis; The Epidemic Prognosis Incorporating Disease and Environmental Monitoring for Integrated Assessment system; time series analysis; climate; epidemiological monitoring; forecasting; malaria; parasitology; procedures; Climate; Disease Outbreaks; Epidemiological Monitoring; Ethiopia; Forecasting; Humans; Malaria; Population Surveillance; Software","Murray, C.J.L., Rosenfeld, L.C., Lim, S.S., Andrews, K.G., Foreman, K.J., Haring, D., Global malaria mortality between 1980 and 2010: A systematic analysis (2012) Lancet, 379, pp. 413-431. , 22305225; Bhatt, S., Weiss, D., Cameron, E., Bisanzio, D., Mappin, B., Dalrymple, U., The effect of malaria control on Plasmodium falciparum in Africa between 2000 and 2015 (2015) Nature, 526, pp. 207-211. , 1:CAS:528:DC%2BC2MXhsFersLrN 26375008 4820050; Abeku, T.A., Response to malaria epidemics in Africa (2007) Emerg Infect Dis, 13, pp. 681-686. , 17553244 2738452; Maes, P., Harries, A.D., Van Den Bergh, R., Noor, A., Snow, R.W., Tayler-Smith, K., Can timely vector control interventions triggered by atypical environmental conditions prevent malaria epidemics?

The overall burden of influenza is captured by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s influenza-like illness network, which provides invaluable information about the current incidence. This information is used to provide decision support regarding prevention and response efforts. Despite the relatively rich surveillance data and the recurrent nature of seasonal influenza, forecasting the timing and intensity of seasonal influenza in the U.S. remains challenging because the form of the disease transmission process is uncertain, the disease dynamics are only partially observed, and the public health observations are noisy. Fitting a probabilistic state-space model motivated by a deterministic mathematical model [a susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) model] is a promising approach for forecasting seasonal influenza while simultaneously accounting for multiple sources of uncertainty. A significant finding of this work is the importance of thoughtfully specifying the prior, as results critically depend on its specification. Our conditionally specified prior allows us to exploit known relationships between latent SIR initial conditions and parameters and functions of surveillance data. We demonstrate advantages of our approach relative to alternatives via a forecasting comparison using several forecast accuracy metrics. © Institute of Mathematical Statistics, 2017.","Bayesian modeling; Forecasting; Influenza; SIR model; State-space modeling; Time-series",,"Anderson, J.L., An ensemble adjustment Kalman filter for data assimilation (2001) Mon.

Hence, we consider SEIR dynamics with or without infectious force in latent period on random networks with arbitrary degree distributions. Both of these models are governed by intrinsically three dimensional nonlinear systems of ordinary differential equations, which are the same as classical SEIR models. The basic reproduction numbers and the final size formulae are explicitly derived. Predictions of the models agree well with the large-scale stochastic SEIR simulations on contact networks. In particular, for SEIR model without infectious force in latent period, although the length of latent period has no effect on the basic reproduction number and the final epidemic size, it affects the arrival time of the peak and the peak size; while for SEIR model with infectious force in latent period it also affects the basic reproduction number and the final epidemic size. These accurate model predictions, may provide guidance for the control of network infectious diseases with latent periods. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Final epidemic size; Latent period; Probability generating function; Random networks; SEIR models; Stochastic simulations","Differential equations; Disease control; Epidemiology; Forecasting; Nonlinear equations; Ordinary differential equations; Stochastic control systems; Stochastic systems; Final epidemic size; Latent period; Probability generating functions; Random network; Seir models; Stochastic simulations; Stochastic models","Bernoulli, D., Essai d'une nouvelle analyse de la mortalité causée par la petite vérole (1760) Mém Math Phys Acad Roy Sci Paris, 62, pp. 39-64; Ross, R., (1911) The prevention of malaria, , John Murray London; Kermack, W.O., McKendrick, A.G., A contribution to the mathematical theory of epidemics (1927) Proc Royal Soc London B, 115, pp. 700-721; Diekmann, O., Heesterbeek, J.A.P., Metz, J.A.J., On the definition and the computation of the basic reproduction ratio r0 in models for infectious diseases in heterogeneous populations (1990) J Math Biol, 28, pp. 365-382; Dietz, K., The estimation of the basic reproduction number for infectious diseases (1993) Stat Methods Med Res, 2, pp. 23-41; Heesterbeek, J.A.P., Dietz, K., The concept of r0 in epidemic theory (1996) Statist Neerlandica, 50, pp. 89-110; Anderson, R.M., May, R.M., (1992) Infectious diseases of humans, , Oxford University Press Oxford; Keeling, M.J., Rohani, P., (2008) Modeling infectious diseases in humans and animals, , Princeton University Press Princeton; Diekmann, O., De Jong, M.C.M., Metz, J.A.J., A deterministic epidemic model taking account of repeated contacts between the same individuals (1998) J Appl Prob, 35, pp. 448-462; Pastor-Satorras, R., Vespignani, A., Epidemic spreading in scale-free networks (2001) Phys Rev Lett, 86, pp. 3200-3203; Moreno, Y., Pastor-Satorras, R., Vespignani, A., Epidemic outbreaks in complex heterogeneous networks (2002) Eur Phys J B, 26, pp. 521-529; Newman, M.E.J., Spread of epidemic disease on networks (2002) Phys Rev E, 66, p. 016128; Lindquist, J., Ma, J.L., van den Driessche, P., Willeboordse, F.H., Effective degree network disease models (2011) J Math Biol, 62, pp. 143-164; Keeling, M.J., The effects of local spatial structure on epidemiological invasions (1999) Proc Roy Soc B, 266, pp. 859-867; Eames, K.T.D., Keeling, M.J., Modeling dynamic and network heterogeneities in the spread of sexually transmitted diseases (2002) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 99, pp. 13330-13335; Volz, E., SIR dynamics in random networks with heterogeneous connectivity (2008) J Math Biol, 56, pp. 293-310; Mille, J.C., A note on a paper by erik volz: SIR dynamics in random networks (2011) J Math Biol, 62, pp. 349-358; Miller, J.C., Slim, A.C., Volz, E.M., Edge-based compartmental modelling for infectious disease spread (2012) J R Soc Interface, 9, pp. 890-906; Miller, J.C., Volz, E.M., Incorporating disease and population structure into models of SIR disease in contact networks (2013) PLoS One, 8, p. e69162; Miller, J.C., Epidemics on networks with large initial conditions or changing structure (2014) PLoS One, 9, p. e101421; Koch, D., Illner, R., Ma, J.L., Edge removal in random contact networks and the basic reproduction number (2013) J Math Biol, 67, pp. 217-238; Li, M.L., Ma, J.L., van den Driessche, P., Model for disease dynamics of a waterborne pathogen on a random network (2014) J Math Biol; Murray, J.D., (2002) Mathematical biology I: an introduction, 17, pp. 315-327. , Springer New York; Li, M.Y., Muldowney, J.S., Global stability for the SEIR model in epidemiology (1995) Math Biosci, 125, pp. 155-164; Li, M.Y., Smith, H.L., Wang, L., Global dynamics of an SEIR epidemic model with vertical transmission (2001) SIAM J Appl Math, 62, pp. 58-69; Zhang, J., Ma, Z.E., Global dynamic of SEIR epidemic model with saturating contact rate (2003) Math Biosci, 185, pp. 15-32; Li, G.H., Wang, W.D., Jin, Z., (2006) Global stability of an SEIR epidemic model with constant immigration, 30, pp. 1012-1019. , Chaos, Solitons & Fractals; Xu, R., Ma, Z.E., Global stability of a delayed SEIRS epidemic model with saturation incidence rate (2010) Nonlinear Dyn, 61, pp. 229-239; Brauer, F., The kermack-mckendrick epidemic model revisited (2005) Math Biosci, 198, pp. 119-131; Liu, J.L., Zhang, T.L., Epidemic spreading of an SEIRS model in scale-free networks (2011) Commun Nonlinear Sci Numer Simulat, 16, pp. 3375-3384; Jin, Z., Zhang, J.P., Song, L.P., Sun, G.-Q., Kan, J.L., Zhu, H.P., Modelling and analysis of influenza a (h1n1) on networks (2011) BMC Public Health, 11, p.

Objectives: The aim of the study was to investigate the effects of climatic and socioeconomic indicators on malaria transmission and to predict malaria transmission risk until 2025 for all the southeastern endemic counties in Iran. Methods: The aggregated data from indigenous malaria cases, as well as, climatic and socioeconomic indicators of malaria endemic areas were collected on the monthly basis from each county between 2005 and 2015. The collected variables were, then, estimated until 2025 using time series analysis. Considering the nature of these data, two different multilevel models were implemented for vivax and falciparum based on the socioeconomic variable that was used. Finally, applying two different models, two sets of estimates were obtained for malaria transmission risk in each county. Results: The annual decline of malaria transmission was estimated to be 17% based on model 1, and 25% based on the model 2 for vivax (P < 0.001). These estimates were 13% and 21% for falciparum (P < 0.001), respectively. For every increased unit in the wealth index, malaria transmission for vivax and falciparum decreased by 33% (P = 0.001) and 12% (P = 0.54), respectively. Also, for every increase in the mean years of schooling, the transmission decreased by 65% (P < 0.001) and 57% (P = 0.001) for vivax and falciparum. Conclusions: The results of this study, using climatic variables along with socioeconomic variables, indicated the obvious influence of socioeconomic status improvement on decreasing malaria transmission. According to the results, malaria transmission risk will considerably diminish in the next few years. The pattern of malaria transmission decline was consistent with the declining trend of malaria incidence which will move from the west to the east and from the north to the south in the years to come. The transmission risk for falciparum was considerably lower than that of vivax and the endemic areas of falciparum move towards 0 faster than vivax. © 2017, Iranian Red Crescent Medical Journal.","Geographic information systems; Iran; Malaria; Multilevel analysis; Risk","adult; Article; climate change; disease elimination; disease surveillance; disease transmission; endemic disease; female; geographic distribution; health program; human; incidence; Iran; major clinical study; malaria; malaria falciparum; male; medical education; multilevel analysis; Plasmodium vivax; probability; risk factor; socioeconomics; temperature","(2015), Organization WH..World Malaria Report 2015; Edrissian, G.H., Malaria in iran: Past and present situation (2006) Iran J Parasitol, 1 (1), pp. 1-14; Azizi, M.H., Bahadori, M., Brief historical perspectives of malaria in Iran (2013) Arch Iran Med, 16 (2), pp. 131-135. , PubMed: 23360639; Sheikhzadeh, K., Haghdoost, A.A., Bahrampour, A., Zolala, F., Raeisi, A., Assessment of the impact of the malaria elimination programme on the burden of disease morbidity in endemic areas of Iran (2016) Malar J, 15, p. 209. , PubMed: 27074734; Norouzinejad, F., Ghaffari, F., Raeisi, A., Norouzinejad, A., Epidemiological status of malaria in Iran, 2011-2014 (2016) Asian Pac J Trop Med, 9 (11), pp. 1055-1061. , PubMed: 27890364; McKelvie, W.R., Haghdoost, A.A., Raeisi, A., Defining and detecting malaria epidemics in south-east Iran (2012) Malar J, 11, p. 81. , PubMed: 22443235; Loha, E., Lindtjorn, B., Predictors of Plasmodium falciparum malaria incidence in Chano Mille, South Ethiopia: A longitudinal study (2012) Am J Trop Med Hyg., 87 (3), pp. 450-459. , PubMed: 22826493; Bi, P., Tong, S., Donald, K., Parton, K.A., Ni, J., Climatic variables and transmission of malaria: A 12-year data analysis in Shuchen County, China (2003) Public Health Rep, 118 (1), pp. 65-71. , PubMed: 12604766; Parham, P.E., Michael, E., Modeling the effects of weather and climate change on malaria transmission (2010) Environ Health Perspect, 118 (5), pp. 620-626. , PubMed: 20435552; Worrall, E., Basu, S., Hanson, K., Is malaria a disease of poverty?

J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 140, 1023-1038], combining the ""classical"" concept of the power-spectrum model (PSM) and the envelope power spectrum-model (EPSM), was demonstrated to account for several psychoacoustic and speech intelligibility (SI) experiments. The PSM path of the model uses long-time power signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), while the EPSM path uses short-time envelope power SNRs. A systematic comparison of existing SI models for several spectro-temporal manipulations of speech maskers and gender combinations of target and masker speakers [Schubotz et al. (2016). J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 140, 524-540] showed the importance of short-time power features. Conversely, Jørgensen et al. [(2013). J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 134, 436-446] demonstrated a higher predictive power of short-time envelope power SNRs than power SNRs using reverberation and spectral subtraction. Here the GPSM was extended to utilize short-time power SNRs and was shown to account for all psychoacoustic and SI data of the three mentioned studies. The best processing strategy was to exclusively use either power or envelope-power SNRs, depending on the experimental task. By analyzing both domains, the suggested model might provide a useful tool for clarifying the contribution of amplitude modulation masking and energetic masking. © 2017 Acoustical Society of America.",,"Acoustics; Power spectrum; Reverberation; Signal to noise ratio; Energetic masking; Power signals; Predictive power; Processing strategies; Si models; Spectral subtractions; Speech maskers; Time intensities; Speech intelligibility; auditory stimulation; auditory threshold; comparative study; female; human; male; masking; noise; perceptive discrimination; procedures; psychoacoustics; signal noise ratio; speech; speech audiometry; speech intelligibility; speech perception; time factor; voice; Acoustic Stimulation; Audiometry, Speech; Auditory Threshold; Discrimination (Psychology); Female; Humans; Male; Noise; Perceptual Masking; Psychoacoustics; Signal-To-Noise Ratio; Speech Acoustics; Speech Intelligibility; Speech Perception; Time Factors; Voice Quality","(1969) Methods for the Calculation of the Articulation Index, , ANSI.

This paper proposes an approach that combines high resolution agent-based models using realistic social contact networks for simulating epidemic evolution with a particle filter based method for assimilation based forecasting. Agent-based modeling using realistic social contact networks provides two key advantages: (i) they capture the causal processes underlying the epidemic and hence are useful to understand the role of interventions on the course of the epidemics - typically time series models cannot capture this and as a result often do not perform well in such situations; (ii) they provide detailed forecast information - this allows us to produce forecast at high levels of temporal, spatial and social granularity. We also propose a new variation of particle filter technique called beam search particle filtering. The modification allows us to more efficiently search the parameter space which is necessitated by the fact that agent-based techniques are computationally expensive. We illustrate our methodology on the synthetic dataset of Ebola provided as a part of the NSF/NIH Ebola forecasting challenge. Our results show the efficacy of the proposed approach and suggest that agent-based causal models can be combined with filtering techniques to yield a new class of assimilation models for infectious disease forecasting. © 2017 IEEE.","Data assimilation; Ebola disease modeling; Epidemic forecasting; Particle Filter","Autonomous agents; Computational methods; Data mining; Diseases; Epidemiology; Filtration; Monte Carlo methods; Agent-based technique; Data assimilation; Disease modeling; Filtering technique; Forecast information; Infectious disease; Particle filter; Temporal evolution; Forecasting","Molinari, N.A.M., Ortega-Sanchez, I.R., Messonnier, M.L., Thompson, W.W., Wortley, P.M., Weintraub, E., Bridges, C.B., The annual impact of seasonal influenza in the us: Measuring disease burden and costs (2007) Vaccine, 25 (27), pp. 5086-5096; Hethcote, H.W., The mathematics of infectious diseases (2000) SIAM Review, 42 (4), pp. 599-653; Bisset, K., Chen, J., Feng, X., Epifast: A fast algorithm for large scale realistic epidemic simulations on distributed memory systems (2009) 23rd International Conference on Supercomputing, pp. 430-439; Meyers, L.A., Contact network epidemiology: Bond percolation applied to infectious disease prediction and control (2007) Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society, 44 (1), pp. 63-86; Barrett, C., Bisset, K.R., Eubank, S.G., Feng, X., Marathe, M., Episimdemics: An efficient and scalable framework for simulating the spread of infectious disease on large social networks (2008) International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis (SC08), , November; Bisset, K.R., Chen, J., Deodhar, S., Feng, X., Ma, Y., Marathe, M.V., Indemics : An interactive high-performance computing framework for data intensive epidemic modeling (2014) ACM Transactions on Modeling and Computer Simulation, 24 (1), pp. 41-432; Shaman, J., Karspeck, A., Yang, W., Tamerius, J., Lipsitch, M., Real-time influenza forecasts during the 2012-2013 season (2013) Nature Communications, 4, p. 2837; Yang, W., Karspeck, A., Shaman, J., Comparison of filtering methods for the modeling and retrospective forecasting of influenza epidemics (2014) PLoS Computational Biology, 10 (4), p. e1003583; (2015) Rapidd Ebola Challenge, , http://ebola-challenge.org, Aug; Loganathan, P., Ho Chee, S., Hao Ran, L., Lakshminarayanan, S., Towards forecasting flu dynamics using a regionalized state space model (2011) Advanced Control of Industrial Processes (ADCONIP), 2011 International Symposium on, (1), pp. 175-180; Ong, J.B.S., Chen, M.I.-C., Cook, A.R., Lee, H.C., Lee, V.J., Lin, R.T.P., Tambyah, P.A., Goh, L.G., Real-time epidemic monitoring and forecasting of h1n1-2009 using influenza-like illness from general practice and family doctor clinics in Singapore (2010) PloS One, 5 (4), p. e10036; Dukic, V., Lopes, H.F., Polson, N.G., Tracking epidemics with google flu trends data and a state-space seir model (2012) Journal of the American Statistical Association, 107, pp. 1410-1426. , January; Dawson, P., Gailis, R., Meehan, A., Detecting disease outbreaks using a combined Bayesian network and particle filter approach (2015) Journal of Theoretical Biology, 370, pp. 171-183; Koepke, A.A., Longini, I.M., Halloran, M.E., Wakefield, J., Minin, V.N., Predictive modeling of cholera outbreaks in Bangladesh (2016) Annals of Applied Statistics, 10 (2), pp. 575-595; Skvortsov, A., Ristic, B., Monitoring and prediction of an epidemic outbreak using syndromic observations (2012) Mathematical Biosciences, 240 (1), pp. 12-19; Skvortsov, A., Ristic, B., Woodruff, C., Predicting an epidemic based on syndromic surveillance (2010) 2010 13th International Conference on Information Fusion, pp. 1-8; Osgood, N., Liu, J., Towards closed loop modeling: Evaluating the prospects for creating recurrently regrounded aggregate simulation models using particle filtering (2014) Proceedings of the Winter Simulation Conference, pp. 829-841. , Savanah, GA; Sheinson, D.M., Niemi, J., Meiring, W., Comparison of the performance of particle filter algorithms applied to tracking of a disease epidemic (2014) Mathematical Biosciences, 255 (1), pp. 21-32; Eubank, S., Guclu, H., Kumar, V.A., Marathe, M.V., Srinivasan, A., Toroczkai, Z., Wang, N., Modelling disease outbreaks in realistic urban social networks (2004) Nature, 429 (6988), pp. 180-184; Gordon, N., Salmond, D., Smith, M.A.F., Novel approach to nonlinear/non-Gaussian Bayesian state estimation (1993) IEE Proceedings F Radar and Signal Processing, 140 (2), p. 107; Mousavi, S.R., Bahri, F., Tabataba, F.S., An enhanced beam search algorithm for the shortest common supersequence problem (2012) Eng.

The first one is a continuous SEIR model described by a system of ordinary differential equations. The second one is a discrete model formulated as a set of difference equations, which was used in the Baroyan-Rvachev modeling framework for the influenza outbreak prediction in the Soviet Union. The outbreak peak day and height predictions were performed by calibrating both models to varied-size samples of long-term data on ARI incidence in Moscow, Saint Petersburg, and Novosibirsk. The accuracy of the modeling predictions on incomplete data was compared with a number of other peak forecasting methods tested on the same dataset. The drawbacks of the described prediction approach and possible ways to overcome them are discussed.","Epidemiology; Influenza; Mathematical modeling; Prediction","Difference equations; Epidemiology; Mathematical models; Ordinary differential equations; Discrete modeling; Forecasting methods; Incomplete data; Influenza; Model framework; Model prediction; Soviet Union; System of ordinary differential equations; Forecasting; algorithm; calibration; city; communicable disease control; epidemic; human; incidence; infectious disease medicine; influenza; procedures; reproducibility; retrospective study; Russian Federation; theoretical model; Algorithms; Calibration; Cities; Communicable Disease Control; Disease Outbreaks; Humans; Incidence; Infectious Disease Medicine; Influenza, Human; Models, Theoretical; Reproducibility of Results; Retrospective Studies; Russia","Baroyan, O., Basilevsky, U., Ermakov, V., Frank, K., Rvachev, L., Shashkov, V., Computer modelling of influenza epidemics for large-scale systems of cities and territories (1970) Proc.

The model consists of four coupled time fractional ordinary differential equations. The time-fractional derivative is defined in the Caputo sense. Firstly, we solve this model by solving an approximate model that linearizes the four time fractional ordinary differential equations (TFODE) at each time step. Secondly, we derive an analytical solution of the single TFODE. Then, we can obtain analytical solutions of the four coupled TFODE at each time step, respectively. Thirdly, a computationally effective fractional Predictor-Corrector method (FPCM) is proposed for simulating the single TFODE. And the error analysis for the fractional predictor-corrector method is also given. It can be shown that the fractional model provides an interesting technique to describe measles spreading dynamics. We conclude that the analytical and Predictor-Corrector schemes derived are easy to implement and can be extended to other fractional models. Fourthly, for demonstrating the accuracy of analytical solution for fractional decoupled measles model, we applied GMMP Scheme (Gorenflo-Mainardi-Moretti-Paradisi) to the original fractional equations. The comparison of the numerical simulations indicates that the solution of the decoupled and linearized system is close enough to the solution of the original system. And it also indicates that the linearizing technique is correct and effective. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Analytical solution; GMMP Scheme; Predictor-corrector method; SEIR measles model; Time fractional model",,"Baleanu, D., Diethelm, K., Scalas, E., Trujillo, J.J., (2012) Fractional Calculus: Models and Numerical Methods, , World Scientific Publishing, Singapore; Podlubny, I., (1999) Fractional Differential Equations, , Academic Press, New York; Liu, F., Anh, V., Turner, I., Numerical Solution Of The space fractional Fokker-Planck equation (2004) J.

Data are more ubiquitous and richer than ever before and population biology in the big data era need to integrate novel methods. Calibrated Individual Based Models (IBMs) are powerful tools for process based predictive modelling. Intervention analysis is the analysis in time series of the potential impact of an event such as an extreme event or an experimentally designed intervention on the time series, for example vaccinating a population. A method for big data analytics (causal impact) that implements a Bayesian intervention approach to estimating the causal effect of a designed intervention on a time series is used to quantify the deviance between data and IBM outputs. Having quantified the deviance between IBM outputs and data, IBM scenarios are used to predict the counterfactual. The counterfactual is how the IBM response metric would have evolved after the intervention if the intervention had never occurred. The method is exemplified to quantify the deviance between a calibrated IBM outputs and epidemiological data of Bovine Tuberculosis with changing the cattle TB testing frequency as the intervention covariate. The advantage of IBM data validation and uncertainty assessment as time series is also discussed. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Agent based models; Causal inference; Counterfactual prediction; Epidemiology; Model validation; Time series","Autonomous agents; Bayesian networks; Computational methods; Ecology; Epidemiology; Inference engines; Population statistics; Time series; Time series analysis; Agent-based model; Causal inferences; Individual based model; Intervention analysis; Model validation; Predictive modelling; Testing frequencies; Uncertainty assessment; Big data; Bayesian analysis; calibration; epidemiology; extreme event; model validation; numerical model; prediction; time series analysis; tuberculosis; Bos; Bovinae","Aanensen, D.M., Huntley, D.M., Feil, E.J., al-Own, F., Spratt, B.G., EpiCollect: linking smartphones to web applications for epidemiology, ecology and community data collection (2009) PLoS ONE, 4; Albuquerque, M.T.D., Gerassis, S., Sierra, C., Taboada, J., Martín, J.E., Antunes, I.M.H.R., Gallego, J.R., Developing a new Bayesian risk index for risk evaluation of soil contamination (2017) Sci Total Environ, 603-604, pp. 167-177; Andre, F.E., Booy, R., Bock, H.L., Clemens, J., Datta, S.K., John, T.J., Lee, B.W., Ruff, T., Vaccination greatly reduces disease, disability, death and inequity worldwide (2008) Bull World Health Org, 86, pp. 140-146. , COI: 1:STN:280:DC%2BD1c7kt1Srtg%3D%3D; Aznar, I., Frankena, K., More, S.J., O’Keeffe, J., McGrath, G., de Jong, M.C.M., Quantification of mycobacterium bovis transmission in a badger vaccine field trial (2018) Prev Vet Med, 149, pp. 29-37. , COI: 1:STN:280:DC%2BC1Mzmtl2iuw%3D%3D; Begon, M., Townsend, C.A., Harper, J.L., (2005) Ecology: from individuals to ecosystems, , Wiley, Oxford; Bollerslev, T., Generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (1986) J Econom, 31, pp. 307-327; Briggs, H., (2015) Testing ‘more effective’ than Badger Cull, , http://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-30820579:BBC; Brodersen, K.H., Gallusser, F., Koehler, J., Remy, N., Scott, S.L., Inferring causal impact using Bayesian structural time-series models (2015) Ann Appl Stat, 9, pp. 247-274; Brooks-Pollock, E., Roberts, G.O., Keeling, M.J., A dynamic model of bovine tuberculosis spread and control in Great Britain (2014) Nature, 511, pp. 228-231. , COI: 1:CAS:528:DC%2BC2cXhtFehsL3K; Burnham, K.P., Anderson, D.R., (2002) Model selection and multimodel inference, , Springer, New York; Carter, S.P., Chambers, M.A., Rushton, S.P., Shirley, M.D.F., Schuchert, P., Pietravalle, S., Murray, A., McDonald, R.A., BCG vaccination reduces risk of tuberculosis infection in vaccinated badgers and unvaccinated badger cubs (2012) PLoS ONE, 7. , COI: 1:CAS:528:DC%2BC3sXht1U%3D; Claridge, J., Diggle, P., McCann, C.M., Mulcahy, G., Flynn, R., McNair, J., Strain, S., Williams, D.J.L., Fasciola hepatica is associated with the failure to detect bovine tuberculosis in dairy cattle (2012) Nat Commun, 3, p. 853; Congdon, P., Representing spatial dependence and spatial discontinuity in ecological epidemiology: a scale mixture approach (2017) Stoch Environ Res Risk Assess, 31, pp. 291-304; Daliakopoulos, I.N., Katsanevakis, S., Moustakas, A., Spatial downscaling of alien species presences using machine learning (2017) Front Earth Sci, 5, p. 60; Damos, P., A stepwise algorithm to detect significant time lags in ecological time series in terms of autocorrelation functions and ARMA model optimisation of pest population seasonal outbreaks (2016) Stoch Environ Res Risk Assess, 30, pp. 1961-1980; (2016) Annex—Background and Methodology to the National Statistics on the Incidence of Tuberculosis (TB) in Cattle in Great Britain; (2016) Bovine TB Testing Intervals, 2016, , https://www.gov.uk/guidance/bovine-tb-testing-intervals-2016; (2016) Monthly Publication of National Statistics on the Incidence of Tuberculosis (TB) in Cattle to End August 2016 for Great Britain; Diebold, F.X., (1998) Elements of forecasting, , Citeseer, Harrisburg; Dunson, D.B., Commentary: practical advantages of Bayesian analysis of epidemiologic data (2001) Am J Epidemiol, 153, pp. 1222-1226. , COI: 1:STN:280:DC%2BD3MzltFKrsg%3D%3D; Edwards, J.K., Lesko, C.R., Keil, A.P., Invited commentary: causal inference across space and time—quixotic quest, worthy goal, or both?

A simulation example shows the usefulness of the presented approach. © 2018 IEEE.","discrete-time; Epidemic models; least-squares; parameter estimation; SI(n)RS model","Epidemiology; Discrete time; Discrete-time model; Epidemic models; Estimated parameter; Estimation procedures; Least Square; Projection algorithms; Simulation example; Parameter estimation","https://www.bcm.edu/departments/molecular-virology-and-microbiology/emerging-infections-and-biodefense/introduction-toinfectious-diseases, Baylor College of Medicine, Access, July 20, 2017; Keeling, M.J., Rohani, P., (2008) Modeling Infectious Diseases in Humans and Animals, , Princeton University Press; De La Sen, M., Ibeas, A., Alonso-Quesada, S., On vaccination controls for the SEIR epidemic model (2012) Communications in Nonlinear Science and Numerical Simulation, 17 (6), pp. 2637-2658; Nistal, R., De La Sen, M., Alonso-Quesada, S., Ibeas, A., On a generalized SVEIR epidemic model under regular and adaptive impulsive vaccination (2014) Nonlinear Analysis: Modelling and Control, 19 (1), pp. 83-108; Ibeas, A., De La Sen, M., Alonso-Quesada, S., Zamani, I., Stability analysis and observer design for discrete-time SEIR epidemic models (2015) Advances in Difference Equations, 122. , 2015; Nistal, R., De La Sen, M., Alonso-Quesada, S., Ibeas, A., Garrido, A.J., On the stability and equilibrium points of multistaged SI(n)R epidemic models (2015) Discrete Dynamics in Nature and Society, 15p; Capistrán, M.A., Moreles, M.A., Lara, B., Parameter estimation of some epidemic models.

Disease prediction models can help support targeted intervention, particularly if they have fine spatial resolution. But, choosing an appropriate resolution is a difficult problem since choice of spatial scale can have a significant impact on accuracy of predictive models. In this paper, we introduce a new approach to spatial clustering for disease prediction we call complexity-based spatial hierarchical clustering. The technique seeks to find spatially compact clusters that have time series that can be well characterized by models of low complexity. We evaluate our approach with 2 years of malaria case data from Tak Province in northern Thailand. We show that the technique’s use of reduction in Akaike information criterion (AIC) and Bayesian information criterion (BIC) as clustering criteria leads to rapid improvement in predictability and significantly better predictability than clustering based only on minimizing spatial intra-cluster distance for the entire range of cluster sizes over a variety of predictive models and prediction horizons. © 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Akaike information criterion;

In addition, we address the aspect of trained immunity in our model. Using a mathematical approach of a system of ordinary differential equations which can be developed over several time-points we obtained varying infection or attack rates that led to different effects of the vaccination, depending on the setting of certain parameters and starting values in the compartments of a SEIR-model. We finally obtained different graphs of disease progression and were able to outline which upgrades and expansions our system requires in order to be exact and well adapted for predicting the course of future TB outbreaks. The model might also be beneficial in predicting non-specific effects of vaccines. © 2019 the Author(s).","Compartment models; Non-specific effects; ODE system; SEIR model; Trained Immunity; Tuberculosis; Vaccination","Forecasting; Ordinary differential equations; Compartment model; ODE system; Seir models; Specific effects; Trained Immunity; Tuberculosis; Vaccination; Vaccines","Brodhun, B., Altman, D., Hauer, B., (2018) Bericht Zur Epidemiologie Der Tuberkulose in Deutschland Für 2017 (Report on the Epidemiology of Tuberculosis in Germany for 2017) (in German), , Robert Koch-Institut, Berlin; Bozorgmehr, K., Stock, C., Joggerst, B., Tuberculosis screening in asylum seekers in Germany: A need for better data (2018) The Lancet, 3, pp. 359-361; Bozorgmehr, K., Preussler, S., Wagner, U., Using country of origin to inform targeted tuberculosis screening in asylum seekers: A modelling study of screening data in a German federal state, 2002-2015 (2019) BMC Infect.

Influenza epidemics and pandemics are associated with changes in the society structure that contribute to the spread of new viral strains in certain environmental and social settings. Currently, influenza is one of the most common global diseases that results in annual epidemics or even pandemics, often leading to lethal outcome. Influenza viruses are uniquely prone to variability via point mutations, recombination and gene reassortment accompanied with changes in their biological properties considered as the main cause of uncontrolled infection spread. Hence, examining cohorts of predisposed individuals by using probability models provides not only additional information about viral outbreaks, but also allows monitoring dynamics of viral epidemics in controlled areas. Understanding influenza epidemiology is crucial for restructuring healthcare resources. Public healthcare service mainly relies on influenza vaccination. However, there are vulnerable cohorts such as elderly and immunocompromised individuals, which usually contain no protective anti-influenza virus antibody level. Despite advances in the developing vaccines and chemotherapy, large-scale influenza epidemics still continue to emerge. Upon that, no reliable methods for disease prognosis based on rate of ongoing epidemic situation are currently available. Monitoring and predicting emerging epidemics is complicated due to discrepancy between dynamics of influenza epidemics that might be evaluated by using surveillance data as well as platform for tracking influenza incidence rate. However, it may be profoundly exacerbated by mutations found in the influenza virus genome by altering genuine morbidity dynamics. Use of probabilistic models for assessing parameters of stochastic epidemics would contribute to more accurately predicted changes in morbidity rate. Here, an SIR+A probabilistic model considering a relationship between infected, susceptible and protected individuals as well as the aggressiveness of external risks for predicting changes in influenza morbidity rate that allowed to evaluate and predict the 2016 ARVI influenza incidence rate in Moscow area. Moreover, introducing an intensity of infection parameter allows to conduct a reliable analysis of incidence rate and predict its changes. © Контаров Н.А. и соавт., 2019.","ARVI; Assessment; Disease; Influenza; Mathematical model; Prediction; SIR+А","Article; disease predisposition; human; incidence; infection risk; influenza; mathematical model; morbidity; Russian Federation","Barojan, O.V., Rvachev, L.A., Ivannikov, Yu.G., (1977) Modeling and Prediction of Influenza Epidemics for the Territory of the USSR, p. 546. , Бароян О.В., Рвачев Л.А., Иванников Ю.Г.

DeGroote Institute for Infectious Disease Research, 1280 Main Street West, Hamilton, ON  L8S 4K1, Canada","Seasonal variation in environmental variables, and in rates of contact among individuals, are fundamental drivers of infectious disease dynamics. Unlike most periodically forced physical systems, for which the precise pattern of forcing is typically known, underlying patterns of seasonal variation in transmission rates can be estimated approximately at best, and only the period of forcing is accurately known. Yet solutions of epidemic models depend strongly on the forcing function, so dynamical predictions-such as changes in epidemic patterns that can be induced by demographic transitions or mass vaccination-are always subject to the objection that the underlying patterns of seasonality are poorly specified. Here, we demonstrate that the key bifurcations of the standard epidemic model are invariant to the shape of seasonal forcing if the amplitude of forcing is appropriately adjusted. Consequently, analyses applicable to real disease dynamics can be conducted with a smooth, idealized sinusoidal forcing function, and qualitative changes in epidemic patterns can be predicted without precise knowledge of the underlying forcing pattern. We find similar invariance in a seasonally forced predator-prey model, and conjecture that this phenomenon-and the associated robustness of predictions-might be a feature of many other periodically forced dynamical systems. © 2019 The Author(s).","Dynamical systems; Infectious disease; Nonlinear oscillators; Predator-prey model; Seasonal forcing; SIR epidemic model","Disease control; Diseases; Dynamical systems; Ecology; Forecasting; Infectious disease; Non-linear oscillators; Predator-prey modeling; Seasonal forcing; SIR epidemic model; Predator prey systems; Article; basic reproduction number; disease transmission; epidemic; family; human; infection; mass immunization; measles; mumps; pertussis; predator prey interaction; rubella; seasonal variation; animal; biological model; communicable disease; epidemic; season; Animals; Communicable Diseases; Epidemics; Humans; Models, Biological; Seasons","Shaman, J., Kohn, M., Absolute humidity modulates influenza survival, transmission, and seasonality (2009) Proc.

The dynamics become very complex of epidemics in sweeping population. Efficient descriptive, predictive, preventive and prescriptive analyses on the huge data generated by SMAC are very crucial for valuable arrangement and associated responsive tactics. In this paper, we have proposed the use of machine learning techniques for performance evaluation of time series forecasting of Ebola casualties. By experimenting without lag creation, we achieved the best results in the MAE of 7.85%, RMSE value of 61.14%, and Direction Accuracy of 85.99% with Random Tree Classifier. Thus we can conclude that by using these models for forecasting epidemic spread and developing public health policies leads the health authorities to ensure the appropriate actions for the control of the outbreak. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2018.","Ebola; Epidemic Forecasting; SMAC; Time series forecasting Random tree","Disease control; Diseases; Forecasting; Learning algorithms; Time series; Time series analysis; Ebola; Machine learning techniques; Performance analysis; Public health policies; Random tree; SMAC; State-of-art technology; Time series forecasting; Machine learning","Pyne, S., Vullikanti, A.K.S., Marathe, M.V., Big Data applications in health sciences and epidemiology (2015) Handbook of Statistics, 33, pp. 171-202. , ISSN 0169-7161; (2018) Ebola Virus Disease: Fact Sheet, , http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs103/en/; Last, J., (2001) A Dictionary of Epidemiology, , 4th edn.

To do so, we used the GPS-based data of the Aedes larvae collected during 2014–2015 in Lahore. We developed a Geographically Weighted Logistic Regression (GWLR) model for Geospatially predicting larvae presence or absence in Lahore. Data on rainfall, temperature are included along with time series of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) derived from Landsat imagery. We observed a high spatial variability of the GWLR parameter estimates of these variables in the study area. The GWLR model significantly (R2a = 0.78) explained the presence or absence of Aedes larvae with temperature, rainfall and NDVI variables in South and Southeast of the study area. In the North and North-West, however, GWLR relationships were observed weak in highly populated areas. Interpolating GWLR coefficients generate more accurate maps of Aedes larvae presence or absence. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","dengue fever; disease forecasting; epidemiology; geographically weighted logistic regression; multispectral remote sensing; small area surveillance",,"Ali, H., Alvi, A., Fatima, S., Zafar, F., Naveed, S., Khan, K., Ali, U., Mallick, N., Dengue fever in Pakistan, episodes of epidemic to endemic: Treatment challenges, prevention and current facts (2017) J.

Therefore, the early prediction of and interventions against influenza epidemics are crucial to reduce mortality and morbidity because of this disease. Similar to other countries, the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (TWCDC) has implemented influenza surveillance and reporting systems, which primarily rely on influenza-like illness (ILI) data reported by health care providers, for the early prediction of influenza epidemics. However, these surveillance and reporting systems show at least a 2-week delay in prediction, indicating the need for improvement. Objective: We aimed to integrate the TWCDC ILI data with electronic medical records (EMRs) of multiple hospitals in Taiwan. Our ultimate goal was to develop a national influenza trend prediction and reporting tool more accurate and efficient than the current influenza surveillance and reporting systems. Methods: First, the influenza expertise team at Taipei Medical University Health Care System (TMUHcS) identified surveillance variables relevant to the prediction of influenza epidemics. Second, we developed a framework for integrating the EMRs of multiple hospitals with the ILI data from the TWCDC website to proactively provide results of influenza epidemic monitoring to hospital infection control practitioners. Third, using the TWCDC ILI data as the gold standard for influenza reporting, we calculated Pearson correlation coefficients to measure the strength of the linear relationship between TMUHcS EMRs and regional and national TWCDC ILI data for 2 weekly time series datasets. Finally, we used the Moving Epidemic Method analyses to evaluate each surveillance variable for its predictive power for influenza epidemics. Results: Using this framework, we collected the EMRs and TWCDC ILI data of the past 3 influenza seasons (October 2014 to September 2017). On the basis of the EMRs of multiple hospitals, 3 surveillance variables, TMUHcS-ILI, TMUHcS-rapid influenza laboratory tests with positive results (RITP), and TMUHcS-influenza medication use (IMU), which reflected patients with ILI, those with positive results from rapid influenza diagnostic tests, and those treated with antiviral drugs, respectively, showed strong correlations with the TWCDC regional and national ILI data (r=.86-.98). The 2 surveillance variables—TMUHcS-RITP and TMUHcS-IMU—showed predictive power for influenza epidemics 3 to 4 weeks before the increase noted in the TWCDC ILI reports. Conclusions: Our framework periodically integrated and compared surveillance data from multiple hospitals and the TWCDC website to maintain a certain prediction quality and proactively provide monitored results. Our results can be extended to other infectious diseases, mitigating the time and effort required for data collection and analysis.

Brazil has been traditionally praised by its HIV/Aids program, which provides free-of-charge care for people living with HIV-1. Using public epidemiology and demographic databases, we aimed at modeling HIV-1 MTCT prevalence in Brazil through the years (1994–2016) and elaborate a statistical model for forecasting, contributing to HIV-1 epidemiologic surveillance and healthcare decision-making. We downloaded sets of live births and mothers’ data alongside HIV-1 cases notification in children one year old or less. Through time series modeling, we estimated prevalence along the years in Brazil, and observed a remarkable decrease of HIV-1 MTCT between 1994 (10 cases per 100,000 live births) and 2016 (five cases per 100,000 live births), a reduction of 50%. Using our model, we elaborated a prognosis for each Brazilian state to help HIV-1 surveillance decision making, indicating which states are in theory in risk of experiencing a rise in HIV-1 MTCT prevalence. Ten states had good (37%), nine had mild (33%), and eight had poor prognostics (30%). Stratifying the prognostics by Brazilian region, we observed that the Northeast region had more states with poor prognosis, followed by North and Midwest, Southeast and South with one state of poor prognosis each. Brazil undoubtedly advanced in the fight against HIV-1 MTCT in the past two decades. We hope our model will help indicating where HIV-1 MTCT prevalence may rise in the future and support government decision makers regarding HIV-1 surveillance and prevention. © 2019 Sociedade Brasileira de Infectologia","Biostatistics; Epidemiology; Forecasting; HIV-1; Perinatal transmission; Vertical transmission","article; biostatistics; Brazil; child; clinical article; controlled study; decision making; female; forecasting; government; human; Human immunodeficiency virus 1; infant; live birth; mother; nonhuman; prevalence; prognosis; theoretical study; time series analysis; vertical transmission; adolescent; adult; Brazil; forecasting; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; middle aged; pregnancy; pregnancy complication; statistical model; time factor; vertical transmission; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Brazil; Child; Female; Forecasting; HIV Infections; HIV-1; Humans; Infectious Disease Transmission, Vertical; Linear Models; Middle Aged; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications, Infectious; Prevalence; Time Factors; Young Adult","World Health Organization, Progress Report on the Global Plan towards the elimination of new HIV infections among children and keeping their mothers alive (2015); Volmink, J.A., Marais, B.J., HIV: mother-to-child transmission (2008) BMJ Clin Evid, 2008; Luzuriaga, K., Mother-to-child transmission of HIV: a global perspective (2007) Curr Infect Dis Rep, 9 (6), pp. 511-517; Brasil, MINISTÉRIO DA SAÚDE, Departamento de Vigilância, Prevenção e Controle das Infecções Sexualmente Transmissíveis (2017) Protocolo Clínico e Diretrizes Terapêuticas para Manejo da Infecção pelo HIV em Adultos, p. 412. , Editora MS Brasília; (2017), Brasil.

The effective allocation of resources is often difficult due to external and internal factors imposing nonlinear fluctuations in the prevalence of dengue fever. We aimed to construct an early-warning system that could accurately forecast subsequent dengue cases in three dengue endemic regions, namely San Juan, Iquitos, and the Philippines. The problem is solely regarded as a time series forecasting problem ignoring the known epidemiology of dengue fever as well as the other meteorological variables. Autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA)model is a popular classical time series model for linear data structures whereas with the advent of neural networks, nonlinear structures in the data set can be handled. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid model combining ARIMA and neural network autoregressive (NNAR)model to capture both linearity and nonlinearity in the data sets. The ARIMA model filters out linear tendencies in the data and passes on the residual values to the NNAR model. The proposed hybrid approach is applied to three dengue time-series data sets and is found to give better forecasting accuracy in comparison to the state-of-the-art. The results of this study indicate that dengue cases can be accurately forecasted over a sufficient time period using the proposed hybrid methodology. © 2019","ARIMA model; Dengue forecasting; Hybrid model; Neural network autoregressive model","Time series; ARIMA modeling; Auto regressive models; Autoregressive integrated moving average models; Forecasting accuracy; Hybrid methodologies; Hybrid model; Meteorological variables; Time series forecasting; Forecasting","Brady, O.J., Gething, P.W., Bhatt, S., Messina, J.P., Brownstein, J.S., Hoen, A.G., Moyes, C.L., Hay, S.I., Refining the global spatial limits of dengue virus transmission by evidence-based consensus (2012) PLoS Negl.

Oftentimes, the problem is ill-posed and one has to rely on appropriate regularization techniques to ensure stable parameter estimation from which forward projections with quantified uncertainty could be generated. If the inversion procedure is cast as nonlinear least squares constrained by a system of nonlinear differential equations, then the system has to be solved numerically at every step of the iterative process and the corresponding parameter-to-data map cannot be used to evaluate the Fréchet derivative analytically. To address challenges related to both instability and Jacobian approximation, we propose a novel regularized Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm with iterative rank-one updates for computation of the derivative operator. In order to test the efficiency of this scheme, we conduct numerical experiments using a mathematical model of infectious disease transmission and real incidence data of historic measles outbreaks in the UK. © 2019, Society for Mathematical Biology.","Nonlinear optimization and rank-one update; Stable parameter estimation and forecasting",,"Bakushinsky, A.B., Iterative methods for nonlinear operator equations without regularity.

In mathematical terms, epidemic forecasting is an ill-posed problem due to instability of parameter identification and limited available data. While previous studies have largely estimated the time-dependent transmission rate by assuming specific functional forms (e.g., exponential decay) that depend on a few parameters, here we introduce a novel approach for the reconstruction of nonparametric time-dependent transmission rates by projecting onto a finite subspace spanned by Legendre polynomials. This approach enables us to effectively forecast future incidence cases, the clear advantage over recovering the transmission rate at finitely many grid points within the interval where the data are currently available. In our approach, we compare three regularization algorithms: variational (Tikhonov’s) regularization, truncated singular value decomposition (TSVD), and modified TSVD in order to determine the stabilizing strategy that is most effective in terms of reliability of forecasting from limited data. We illustrate our methodology using simulated data as well as case incidence data for various epidemics including the 1918 influenza pandemic in San Francisco and the 2014–2015 Ebola epidemic in West Africa. © 2017, Society for Mathematical Biology.","Parameter estimation; Regularization; Volterra equation",,"Bakushinsky, A.B., Smirnova, A.B., Liu, H., A nonstandard approximation of pseudoinverse and a new stopping criterion for iterative regularization (2015) Inverse Ill Posed Probl, 23 (3), pp. 195-210; Biggerstaff, M., Alper, D., Dredze, M., Fox, S., Fung, I.C., Hickmann, K.S., Lewis, B., Tsou, M.H., Results from the centers for disease control and prevention’s predict the 2013–2014 Influenza Season Challenge (2016) BMC Infect Dis, 16, p. 357; Bjørnstad, O.N., Finkenstädt, B.F., Grenfell, B.T., Dynamics of measles epidemics: estimating scaling of transmission rates using a time series sir model (2002) Ecol Monogr, 72 (2), pp. 169-184; Camacho, A., Kucharski, A., Aki-Sawyerr, Y., White, M.A., Flasche, S., Baguelin, M., Pollington, T., Funk, S., Temporal changes in Ebola Transmission in Sierra Leone and implications for control requirements: a real-time modelling Study (2015) PLoS Curr; Capistrán, M.A., Moreles, M.A., Lara, B., Parameter estimation of some epidemic models.

Weekly national number of respiratory cases positive for influenza virus infection that were reported to the FluNet surveillance system in Australia, China, the US and the UK were obtained from World Health Organization FluNet surveillance between week 1, 2010, and week 9, 2018. We collected combined search query data for the US and the UK from Google Trends, and for China from Baidu Index.

Parameter estimates for this model were generally consistent with the observed values. The inclusion of search metrics improved the performance of the model with high correlation coefficients (China = 0.96, the US = 0.97, the UK = 0.96, p < 0.01) and low Maximum Absolute Percent Error (MAPE) values (China = 16.76, the US = 96.97, the UK = 125.42). This study demonstrates the feasibility of combining (Australia) influenza and local search query data to predict influenza epidemics a different (northern hemisphere) scales. © 2019, The Author(s).",,"Asian continental ancestry group; Australia; biological model; epidemic; health survey; human; influenza; Internet; search engine; season; time factor; virology; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Australia; Epidemics; Humans; Influenza, Human; Internet; Models, Biological; Population Surveillance; Search Engine; Seasons; Time Factors","Lipsitch, M., Improving the evidence base for decision making during a pandemic: the example of 2009 influenza A/H1N1 (2011) Biosecurity and bioterrorism: biodefense strategy, practice, and science, 9, pp. 89-115; Russell, C.A., Influenza vaccine strain selection and recent studies on the global migration of seasonal influenza viruses (2008) Vaccine, 26, pp. D31-D34. , COI: 1:CAS:528:DC%2BD1cXhtFWmu7bK; Russell, C.A., The global circulation of seasonal influenza A (H3N2) viruses (2008) Science, 320, pp. 340-346. , COI: 1:CAS:528:DC%2BD1cXks1Ghsb8%3D; (2017) Australian Government.

Firstly, some qualitative properties of the model are analyzed. The basic reproduction number R is derived. When R< 1 , the disease-free equilibrium point is unique and locally asymptotically stable. When R> 1 , the endemic equilibrium point is also unique. Furthermore, some conditions are established to ensure the local asymptotic stability of disease-free and endemic equilibrium points. The trend of COVID-19 spread in the USA is predicted. Considering the influence of the individual behavior and government mitigation measurement, a modified SEIQRP model is proposed, defined as SEIQRPD model, which is divided the population into susceptible, exposed, infectious, quarantined, recovered, insusceptible and dead individuals. According to the real data of the USA, it is found that our improved model has a better prediction ability for the epidemic trend in the next two weeks. Hence, the epidemic trend of the USA in the next two weeks is investigated, and the peak of isolated cases is predicted. The modified SEIQRP model successfully capture the development process of COVID-19, which provides an important reference for understanding the trend of the outbreak. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","COVID-19; Epidemic; Fractional order; Generalized SEIR model; Peak prediction","Asymptotic stability; Cell proliferation; Forecasting; Asymptotically stable; Basic reproduction number; Development process; Disease-free equilibrium; Guiding significances; Local asymptotic stability; Mitigation measurements; Qualitative properties; Epidemiology","Lin, Q.Y., Zhao, S., Gao, D.Z., Luo, Y.J., Yang, S., Musa, S.S., Wang, M.H., He, D.H., A conceptual model for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in Wuhan, China with individual reaction and governmental action (2020) Int.

In the case of a coupled human system, a change in human behavior caused by the forecast can alter the course of events that were the subject of the forecast. In this context, the forecast is an integral part of the coupled human system, with two-way feedback between forecast output and human behavior. However, forecasting programs generally do not examine how the forecast might affect the system in question. This study examines how such a coupled system works using a model of viral infection - the susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) model - when the model is used in a forecasting context. Human behavior is modified by making the contact rate responsive to other dynamics, including forecasts, of the SIR system. This modification creates two-way feedback between the forecast and the infection dynamics. Results show that a faster rate of response by a population to system dynamics or forecasts leads to a significant decline in peak infections. Responding to a forecast leads to a lower infection peak than responding to current infection levels. Inaccurate forecasts can lead to either higher or lower peak infections depending on whether the forecast under-or over-estimates the peak. The direction of inaccuracy in a forecast determines whether the outcome is better or worse for the population. While work is still needed to constrain model functional forms, forecast feedback can be an important component of epidemic dynamics that should be considered in response planning. © Copyright 2020 Record and Pershing.","COVID-19; Epidemic; Forecast; Forecast feedback; Model; Reflexive prediction; SIR model",,"Adam, D., Special report: the simulations driving the world's response to Covid-19 (2020) Nature, 580 (7803), pp. 316-318; Anderson, RM, Robert, MM., Population biology of infectious diseases: part I (1979) Nature, 280 (5721), pp. 361-367; Batista, M., Estimation of the final size of the Covid-19 epidemic (2020) medRxiv; Beretta, E, Takeuchi, Y., Global stability of an sir epidemic model with time delays (1995) Journal of Mathematical Biology, 33 (3), pp. 250-260; Biswas, K, Sen, P., (2020) Space-time dependence of corona virus (Covid-19) outbreak, , arXiv preprint arXiv:2003.03149; Chen, Y-C, Lu, P-E, Chang, C-S., (2020) A time-dependent sir model for Covid-19, , arXiv preprint arXiv:2003.00122; Dyer, O., Covid-19: US testing ramps up as early response draws harsh criticism (2020) British Medical Journal Publishing Group, 368, p. m1167; Fanelli, D, Piazza, F., Analysis and forecast of Covid-19 spreading in China, Italy and France (2020) Chaos, Solitons & Fractals, 134, p. 109761; Galatin, M., Optimal forecasting in models with uncertainty when the outcome is influenced by the forecast (1976) Economic Journal, 86 (342), pp. 278-295; Hale, T, Petherick, A, Phillips, T, Webster, S., (2020) Variation in government responses to Covid-19, , Blavatnik School of Government Working Paper. 31; Hobday, AJ, Hartog, JR, Manderson, JP, Mills, KE, Oliver, MJ, Pershing, AJ, Siedlecki, S., Ethical considerations and unanticipated consequences associated with ecological forecasting for marine resources (2019) ICES Journal of Marine Science, 76 (5), pp. 1244-1256; Kopec, M., A more fulfilling (and frustrating) take on reflexive predictions (2011) Philosophy of Science, 78 (5), pp. 1249-1259; Kyrychko, YN, Blyuss, KB., Global properties of a delayed sir model with temporary immunity and nonlinear incidence rate (2005) Nonlinear Analysis: Real World Applications, 6 (3), pp. 495-507; Murray, CJL., Forecasting Covid-19 impact on hospital bed-days, ICU-days, ventilator days and deaths by US state in the next 4 months (2020) medRxiv; Payne, MR, Hobday, AJ, MacKenzie, BR, Tommasi, D, Dempsey, DP, Fässler, SMM, Haynie, AC, Villarino, E., Lessons from the first generation of marine ecological forecast products (2017) Frontiers in Marine Science, 4, p. 289; Pendleton, DE, Sullivan, PJ, Brown, MW, Cole, TVN, Good, CP, Mayo, CA, Monger, BC, Andrew, PJ., Weekly predictions of north atlantic right whale eubalaena glacialis habitat reveal influence of prey abundance and seasonality of habitat preferences (2012) Endangered Species Research, 18 (2), pp. 147-161; Record, NR, Pershing, AJ, Maps, F., The paradox of the 'Paradox of the Plankton' (2014) ICES Journal of Marine Science, 71 (2), pp. 236-240; Roosa, K, Lee, Y, Luo, R, Kirpich, A, Rothenberg, R, Hyman, JM, Yan, P, Chowell, G., Real-time forecasts of the Covid-19 epidemic in China from February 5th to February 24th, 2020 (2020) Infectious Disease Modelling, 5, pp. 256-263; Sabetta, L., Self-defeating prophecies: when sociology really matters (2019) Anticipation, Agency and Complexity, pp. 51-59. , Poli R, Valerio M, eds.

This is by nature a stochastic problem, since e.g., random perturbation in parameters can cause instability of estimation and prediction. This leaves us with a plenty of possible statistical regularizations, thus generating a plethora of sub-problems. We can mention as examples stability and sensitivity of peak estimation, starting point of exponential growth curve, or estimation of parameters of SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Removed) model. Moreover, each parameter has its specific sensitivity, and naturally, the most sensitive parameter deserves a special attention. E.g., in SIR model, parameter β is more sensitive than parameter γ. In a simple exponential epidemic growth model, parameter b is more sensitive than the parameter a. We also discuss on statistical quality of COVID-19 incidence prediction, where we justify an exponential curve considering the microbial growth in ideal conditions for epidemic. The empirical data from Iowa State, USA, Hubei Province in China, New York State, USA, and Chile justifies an exponential growth curve for initiation of epidemics outbreaks. © 2020 The Author(s).

In this research paper, we set forward a statistical model called SIR-Poisson that predicts the evolution and the global spread of infectious diseases. The proposed SIR-Poisson model is able to predict the range of the infected cases in a future period. More precisely, it is used to infer the transmission of the COVID-19 in the three Maghreb Central countries (Tunisia, Algeria, and Morocco). Using the SIR-Poisson model and based on daily reported disease data, since its emergence until end April 2020, we attempted to predict the future disease period over 60 days. The estimated average number of contacts by an infected individual with others was around 2 for Tunisia and 3 for Algeria and Morocco. Relying on inferred scenarios, although the pandemic situation would tend to decline, it has not ended. From this perspective, the risk of COVID-19 spreading still exists after the deconfinement act. It is necessary, therefore, to carry on the containment until the estimated infected number achieves 0. © 2020, King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals.","2019-nCoV; Disease; Inference; Markov Poisson; Prediction; SIR model",,"Hui, D.S., Azhar, E.I., Madani, T.A., The continuing 2019-nCoV epidemic threat of novel coronaviruses to global health—the latest 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan (2020) China.

This paper aims to carry out a short-term projection of new cases; forecast the maximum number of active cases for India and selected high-incidence states; and evaluate the impact of three weeks lock down period using different models. Methods: We used Logistic growth curve model for short term prediction; SIR models to forecast the maximum number of active cases and peak time; and Time Interrupted Regression model to evaluate the impact of lockdown and other interventions. Results: The predicted cumulative number of cases for India was 58,912 (95% CI: 57,960, 59,853) by May 08, 2020 and the observed number of cases was 59,695. The model predicts a cumulative number of 1,02,974 (95% CI: 1,01,987, 1,03,904) cases by May 22, 2020. As per SIR model, the maximum number of active cases is projected to be 57,449 on May 18, 2020. The time interrupted regression model indicates a decrease of about 149 daily new cases after the lock down period, which is statistically not significant. Conclusion: The Logistic growth curve model predicts accurately the short-term scenario for India and high incidence states. The prediction through SIR model may be used for planning and prepare the health systems. The study also suggests that there is no evidence to conclude that there is a positive impact of lockdown in terms of reduction in new cases. © 2020 INDIACLEN","COVID-19; Logistic growth model; Projection; SIR model; Time interrupted regression model",,"Li, Q., Guan, X., Wu, P., Early transmission dynamics in wuhan, China, of novel coronavirus–infected pneumonia (2020) N Engl J Med, 382 (13), pp. 1199-1207; WHO, Novel Coronavirus – China (2020), https://www.who.int/csr/don/12-january-2020-novel-coronavirus-china/en/, [Internet] World Health Organization Geneva Available from:; JHU-CSSE, COVID-19 Dashboard (2020), https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6, [Internet] Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University Baltimore, Maryland Available from:; Cohen, J., Kupferschmidt, K., Mass testing, school closings, lockdowns: countries pick tactics in ‘war’ against coronavirus.

This included restricted testing, isolation, contact tracing and quarantine, and enforcement of a nation-wide lockdown starting 25 March 2020. The objectives of this study were to i) describe the age,gender distribution and mortality among COVID-19 patients identified till 14 April 2020 and predict the range of contact rate; and ii) predict the number of active COVID-19 patients after 40 days of lockdown. Methods: We used a cross-sectional descriptive design for first objective and a susceptible-infected-removed model for in silico predictions. We collected data from government-controlled and crowdsourced websites. Results: Studying age and gender parameters of 1161 Indian COVID-19 patients, the median age was 38 years (IQR, 27-52) with 20-39 year-old males being the most affected group. The number of affected patients were 854 (73.6%) men and 307 (26.4%) women. If the current contact rate continues (0.25-27), India may have 110460 to 220575 infected persons at the end of 40 days lockdown. Conclusion: The disease is majorly affecting a younger age group in India. Interventions have been helpful in preventing the worst-case scenario in India, but will be unable to prevent the spike in number of cases. © 2020 Mazumder A et al.","Coronavirus; COVID-19; India; SIR model","adult;

This media will help them to plan and contain the disease better in trivial provinces and thus decrease the beating of human lives. Some cases of an indeterminate cause of pneumonia occurred in Wuhan, Hubei, China, in December 2019, with clinical presentations closely resembling viral pneumonia. In-depth analyzes of the sequencing from lower respiratory tract samples discovered a novel coronavirus, called 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Current events showed us how easily a coronavirus could take root and spread-such viruses transmitted easily between persons. To cure with these infections, we applied time series forecasting model in this paper to predict possible coronavirus events. The forecasting model applied is SIR.

These model predictions have shown a wide range of variations. In our study, we demonstrate that nonidentifiability in model calibrations using the confirmed-case data is the main reason for such wide variations. Using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) for model selection, we show that an SIR model performs much better than an SEIR model in representing the information contained in the confirmed-case data. This indicates that predictions using more complex models may not be more reliable compared to using a simpler model. We present our model predictions for the COVID-19 epidemic in Wuhan after the lockdown and quarantine of the city on January 23, 2020. We also report our results of modeling the impacts of the strict quarantine measures undertaken in the city after February 7 on the time course of the epidemic, and modeling the potential of a second outbreak after the return-to-work in the city. © 2020 The Authors","Bayesian inference; COVID-19 epidemic in Wuhan; Model selection; Nonidentifiability; Peak time of epidemic; Quarantine; SIR and SEIR models","2019 novel coronavirus; algorithm; Article; basic reproduction number; Bayes theorem; China; coronavirus disease 2019; disease surveillance; disease transmission; epidemic; human; incidence; mathematical model; maximum likelihood method; model; population size; prediction; public health; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2","Akaike, H., Information theory and an extension of the maximum likelihood principle (1973) Second international symposium on information theory, pp. 267-281. , Akademiai Kiado Budapest; Bai, Y., Yao, L., Wei, T., Presumed asymptomatic carrier transmission of COVID-19 (2020) Journal of the American Medical Association, , Published online February 21, 2020; Burnham, K., Anderson, D., Model selection and multimodel inference: A practical information-theoretic approach (2002), Springer-Verlag New York; Chen, M., Shao, Q., Ibrahim, J., Monte Carlo methods in bayesian computation (2000), Springer-Verlag New York; Chowell, G., Castillo-Chavez, C., Fenimore, P., Kribs-Zaleta, C., Model parameters and outbreak control for SARS (2004) Emerging Infectious Diseases, 10, pp. 1258-1263; Cyranoski, D., When will the coronavirus outbreak peak?

Methods Python crawler automatic update function was used to collect the epidemic data released by the National Health Commission of China. An improved infectious disease dynamics SEIR model, which can automatically correct the COVID-19 basic reproductive number (R0), was constructed to predict the development trend of COVID-19 epidemic in Hubei Province of China and South Korea. Results The peak of the COVID-19 epidemic in Hubei Province of China predicted by the model would appear on Feb. 21, 2020. The number of confirmed COVID-19 cases would be about 50 000 on Feb. 19 and would fall to below 30 000 on Mar. 4, and the epidemic would end on May 10. According to the actual data released by the National Health Commission of China, the peak number of confirmed COVID-19 patients was 53 371. The model predicted that an epidemic peak in South Korea would be on Mar. 7, and would end at the end of April. Conclusion This improved infectious disease dynamics SEIR model established in the early stage of COVID-19 epidemic has achieved relatively accurate prediction. The timely and effective intervention by relevant government departments has significantly affected the development of the epidemic. The epidemic situation in other countries in East Asia, such as South Korea, is still on the rise in March, suggesting that China needs to be on guard against the risk of imported epidemic. © 2020 Second Military Medical University Press.

The COVID-19 was quickly spreading in China and emerged nearly all over the world. In this chapter, our motivation is to adopt the deep learning techniques to help clinic doctors to diagnose the patients of COVID-19 and predict the trend of COVID-19. To realize our motivation, we on the one hand adopt deep learning techniques to analyse CT images of patients. The transfer learning and data augmentation techniques are adopted for the lacking of samples in our obtained CT image data set. We build a model by designing and training a new deep network to help clinic doctors to make an appropriate diagnose decision. On the other hand, according to the spreading characteristics of COVID-19 and the controlling measures adopted by Chinese government, we propose to modify the classic SEIR (susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered) model and establish a new SEIR dynamics model with considering the infectiousness of the people in the latent period and the quarantine period. The appropriate parameters of our modified SEIR model are learned by using deep learning techniques. Our proposed deep learning-based diagnosis for COVID-19 can help medicine doctors to make an appropriate diagnostic decision. Our modified SEIR model can effectively predict the transmission trend of COVID-19 and can be used for short-term trend prediction of the epidemic. © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Artificial intelligence; COVID-19; CT images; Deep learning; SEIR model","Computerized tomography; Diagnosis; Forecasting; Learning systems; Motivation; Transfer learning; Chinese Government; Data augmentation; Diagnostic decisions; Dynamics modeling; Learning techniques; Spreading characteristics; Susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered; Trend prediction; Deep learning","Li, Q., Guan, X., Wu, P., Early transmission dynamics in Wuhan, China, of novel coronavirus–infected pneumonia (2020) New England Journal of Medicine; (2020) WHO named the novel coronavirus pneumonia as COVID-19, , http://www.xinhuanet.com/world/2020-02/12/c_1125561389.htm, Xinhuanet.com; Chen, Nanshan, Zhou, Min, Dong, Xuan, Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 99 cases of 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a descriptive study (2020) The Lancet, 395 (10223), pp. 507-513; Guan, W., Ni, Z., Hu, Y., Clinical characteristics of 2019 novel coronavirus infection in China (2020), MedRxiv; Qu, J., Yang, R., Song, L., Kamel, I.

In response to the rapid global dissemination of the virus, on the 11th of Mars, the World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the outbreak a pandemic. Considering this situation, this paper intends to analyze and improve the current SEIR models to better represent the behavior of the COVID-19 and accurately predict the outcome of the pandemic in each social, economic, and political scenario. Methodology: We present a generalized Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) compartmental model and test it using a global optimization algorithm with data collected from the WHO. Results: The main results were: (a) Our model was able to accurately fit the either deaths or active cases data of all tested countries using optimized coefficient values in agreement with recent reports; (b) when trying to fit both sets of data at the same time, fit was good for most countries, but not all. (c) Using our model, large ranges for each input, and optimization we predict death values for 15, 30, 45, and 60 days ahead with errors in the order of 5, 10, 20, and 80%, respectively; (d) sudden changes in the number of active cases cannot be predicted by the model unless data from outside sources are used. Conclusion: The results suggest that the presented model may be used to predict 15 days ahead values of total deaths with errors in the order of 5%. These errors may be minimized if social distance data are inputted into the model. © 2020, Sociedade Brasileira de Engenharia Biomedica.","Active cases; Compartmental model; COVID-19; Deaths; Epidemiological model predictions","Errors; Global optimization; Viruses; Coefficient values; Compartmental model; Coronaviruses; Global optimization algorithm; Seir models; Social distance; Sudden change; World Health Organization; Forecasting","Abutaleb, Y., The U.S. was Beset by Denial and Dysfunction as the Coronavirus Raged. the Washington Post, , https://www.washingtonpost.com/nationalsecurity/2020/04/04/coronavirus-government-dysfunction/?arc404=true, Washington, Apr., 4, 2020.

First, I show that the model is poorly identified from the observed number of deaths and confirmed cases. There are many sets of parameters that are observationally equivalent in the short run but lead to markedly different long run forecasts. Second, I show that the basic reproduction number R0 can be identified from the data, conditional on epidemiologic parameters, and propose several nonlinear SUR approaches to estimate R0. I examine the performance of these methods using Monte Carlo studies and demonstrate that they yield fairly accurate estimates of R0. Next, I apply these methods to estimate R0 for the US, California, and Japan, and document heterogeneity in the value of R0 across regions. My estimation approach accounts for possible underreporting of the number of cases. I demonstrate that if one fails to take underreporting into account and estimates R0 from the reported cases data, the resulting estimate of R0 may be biased downward and the resulting forecasts may exaggerate the long run number of deaths. Finally, I discuss how auxiliary information from random tests can be used to calibrate the initial parameters of the model and narrow down the range of possible forecasts of the future number of deaths. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","COVID-19; Parameter identification; Seemingly unrelated equations; SEIR model","Cell proliferation; Epidemiology; Monte Carlo methods; Auxiliary information; Basic reproduction number; California; Epidemic modeling; Estimation approaches; Initial parameter; Random tests; Run numbers; Forecasting","Acemoglu, D., Chernozhukov, V., Werning, I., Whinston, M.D., Optimal targeted lockdowns in a multi-group SIR model (2020) Working Paper Series, , National Bureau of Economic Research; Atkeson, A., How deadly is COVID-19?

Some critical parameters, such as the background of mortality without considering the disease state and the speed of moving people from infected to resistance, affect the conditions of society. In this paper, early warning indicators are used to predict the bifurcation points in the system. In the interaction of various sub-groups of society, each sub-group can have various parameters. Six cases of the sub-groups interactions are studied. By coupling these sub-groups, various dynamics of the whole society are investigated. © 2020, The Author(s).","Bifurcation; Coupling; Prediction; SEIR model","Dynamics; Mechanical engineering; Bifurcation points; Coronaviruses; Disease state; Early warning indicators; Moving peoples; Sub-groups; Bifurcation (mathematics)","Dong, E., Du, H., Gardner, L., An interactive web-based dashboard to track COVID-19 in real time (2020) Lancet.

Despite a rapid increase in the number of cases and deaths due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the epidemic was stemmed via a combination of epidemic mitigation and control measures. This study evaluates how the implementation of clinical diagnostics and universal symptom surveys contributed to epidemic control in Wuhan. We extended the susceptibles-exposed-infectious-removed (SEIR) transmission dynamics model by considering three quarantined compartments (SEIR+Q). The SEIR+Q dynamics model was fitted using the daily reported number of confirmed infections and unconfirmed cases by clinical diagnostic criteria up to February 14, 2020 in Wuhan. Applying the model to carry forward the pre-February 14 trend in Wuhan, the number of daily new diagnosed cases would be expected to drop below 100 by March 25, below 10 by April 29, and reach 0 by May 31, 2020. The observed case counts after February 14 demonstrated that the daily new cases fell below 100 by March 6, below 10 by March 11, and reached 0 by March 18, or, respectively, 19, 49, and 74 d earlier than model predictions. By March 30, the observed number of cumulative confirmed cases was 50 006, which was 19 951 cases fewer than the predicted count. Effective reproductive number R(t) analysis using observed frequencies showed a remarkable decline after the implementation of clinical diagnostic criteria and universal symptom surveys, which was significantly below the R(t) curve estimated by the model assuming that the pre-February 14 trend was carried forward. In conclusion, the proposed SEIR+Q dynamics model was a good fit for the epidemic data in Wuhan and explained the large increase in the number of infections during February 12–14, 2020.

As the matter of fact, it needs unreserved effort to monitor the prevalence of the virus. However, applying an effective prediction of the prevalence is thought to be the fundamental requirement to effectively control the spreading rate. Time series models have extensively been considered as the convenient methods to predict the prevalence or spreading rate of the disease. This study, therefore, aimed to apply the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) modeling approach for projecting coronavirus (COVID-19) prevalence patterns in East Africa Countries, mainly Ethiopia, Djibouti, Sudan and Somalia. The data for the study were obtained from the reports of confirmed COVID-19 cases by the official website of Johns Hopkins University from 13th March, 2020 to 30th June, 2020.The results of the study, then, showed that in the coming four month, the number of COVID-19 positive people in Ethiopia may reach up to 56,610 from 5,846 on June 30, 2020 in average-rate scenario. However, in worst case scenario forecast, the model showed that the cases will be around 84,497. The analysis further depicted that with average interventions and control scenario, cumulative number of infected persons in Djibouti, Somalia and Sudan will increase from 4,656, 2,904 and 9,258 respectively at the end of June to 8,336, 3,961 and 21,388, which is by the end of October, 2020, after four-months. But, with insufficient intervention, the number of infected persons may grow quickly and reach up to 14,072, 10,037 and 38,174 in Djibouti, Somalia and Sudan respectively. Generally, the extent of the coronavirus spreading was increased from time to time in the past four month, until 30 th June, 2020, and it is expected to continue quicker than before for the coming 4-month, until the end of October, 2020, in Ethiopia, Djibouti, Somalia, and Sudan and more rapidly than before in Sudan and Ethiopia, while the peak will remain unknown yet. Therefore, an effective implementation of the preventive measures and a rigorous compliance by avoiding negligence with the rules such as prohibiting public gatherings, travel restrictions, personal protection measures, and social distancing may alleviate the spreading rates of the virus, particularly, Sudan and Ethiopia. Moreover, more efforts should be exerted on Ethiopian side to control the population movement across all the border areas and to strengthen border quarantining. Further, through updating more new data with continuous reconsideration of predictive model, provide useful and more precise prediction.

CoVID-19 was classified as an epidemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). Although the disease was discovered and concentrated in Hubei Province, China, it was exported to all of the other Chinese provinces and spread globally. As of this writing, all plans have failed to contain the novel coronavirus disease, and it has continued to spread to the rest of the world. This study aimed to explore and interpret the effect of environmental and metrological variables on the spread of coronavirus disease in 30 provinces in China, as well as to investigate the impact of new China regulations and plans to mitigate further spread of infections. This article forecasts the size of the disease spreading based on time series forecasting. The growing size of CoVID-19 in China for the next 210 days is estimated by predicting the expected confirmed and recovered cases. The results revealed that weather conditions largely influence the spread of coronavirus in most of the Chinese provinces. This study has determined that increasing temperature and short-wave radiation would positively increase the number of confirmed cases, mortality rate, and recovered cases. The findings of this study agree with the results of our previous study. © 2020 Verduci Editore s.r.l.

We consider the endemic-epidemic framework, a class of autoregressive models for infectious disease surveillance counts, and replace the default autoregression on counts from the previous time period with more flexible weighting schemes inspired by discrete-time serial interval distributions. We employ three different parametric formulations, each with an additional unknown weighting parameter estimated via a profile likelihood approach, and compare them to an unrestricted nonparametric approach. The new methods are illustrated in a univariate analysis of dengue fever incidence in San Juan, Puerto Rico, and a spatiotemporal study of viral gastroenteritis in the 12 districts of Berlin. We assess the predictive performance of the suggested models and several reference models at various forecast horizons. In both applications, the performance of the endemic-epidemic models is considerably improved by the proposed weighting schemes. © 2020 International Institute of Forecasters","Disease surveillance; Epidemic forecasting; Multivariate logarithmic score; Spatio-temporal modelling; Time series of counts",,"Adegboye, O., Al-Saghir, M., Leung, D., Joint spatial time-series epidemiological analysis of malaria and cutaneous leishmaniasis infection (2017) Epidemiology and Infection, 145 (4), pp. 685-700; Aldstadt, J., Yoon, I., Tannitisupawong, D., Jarman, R., Thomas, S., Gibbons, R., Uppapong, A., Endy, T., Space-time analysis of hospitalised dengue patients in rural Thailand reveals important temporal intervals in the pattern of dengue virus transmission (2012) Tropical Medicine & International Health, 17 (9), pp. 1076-1085; Bauer, C., Wakefield, J., Stratified space-time infectious disease modelling, with an application to hand, foot and mouth disease in China (2018) Journal of the Royal Statistical Society.

Advancing accurate prediction models is of utmost importance to take proper actions. Due to the lack of essential data and uncertainty, the epidemiological models have been challenged regarding the delivery of higher accuracy for long-term prediction. As an alternative to the susceptible-infected-resistant (SIR)-based models, this study proposes a hybrid machine learning approach to predict the COVID-19, and we exemplify its potential using data from Hungary. The hybrid machine learning methods of adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and multi-layered perceptron-imperialist competitive algorithm (MLP-ICA) are proposed to predict time series of infected individuals and mortality rate. The models predict that by late May, the outbreak and the total morality will drop substantially. The validation is performed for 9 days with promising results, which confirms the model accuracy. It is expected that the model maintains its accuracy as long as no significant interruption occurs. This paper provides an initial benchmarking to demonstrate the potential of machine learning for future research. © 2020 by the authors.","COVID-19; Machine learning; Prediction model",,"Gorbalenya, A.E., Baker, S.C., Baric, R.S., de Groot Raoul, J., Drosten, C., Gulyaeva, A.A., Haagmans, B.L., Neuman, B.W., The species Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus: Classifying 2019-nCoV and naming it SARS-CoV-2 (2020) Nat.

A promising forecasting approach is to adapt the well-established endemic-epidemic modeling framework to time series of infectious disease proportions. Using U.S. influenza-like illness surveillance data over 18 seasons, we assessed probabilistic forecasts of this new beta autoregressive model with proper scoring rules. Other readily available forecasting tools were used for comparison, including Prophet, (S)ARIMA and kernel conditional density estimation (KCDE). Short-term flu activity was equally well predicted up to four weeks ahead by the beta model with four autoregressive lags and by KCDE; however, the beta model runs much faster. Non-dynamic Prophet scored worst. Relative performance differed for seasonal peak prediction. Prophet produced the best peak intensity forecasts in seasons with standard epidemic curves; otherwise, KCDE outperformed all other methods. Peak timing was best predicted by SARIMA, KCDE or the beta model, depending on the season. The best overall performance when predicting peak timing and intensity was achieved by KCDE. Only KCDE and naive historical forecasts consistently outperformed the equal-bin reference approach for all test seasons. We conclude that the endemic-epidemic beta model is a performant and easy-to-implement tool to forecast flu activity a few weeks ahead. Real-time forecasting of the seasonal peak, however, should consider outputs of multiple models simultaneously, weighing their usefulness as the season progresses. © 2020 by the authors.

Methods A SEIR compartmental deterministic model was used considering the states: susceptible (S), exposed (E), infected (I) and recovered (R). The model parameters were selected according to the literature review, in the case of the case fatality rate data from the Municipal Secretary of Health were used. Several scenarios were considered taking into account variations in the basic number of reproduction (R0), and the predic-tion until april 9 was compared with the observed data. Results Through the SEIR model it was found that with the highest basic number of reproduction [2,6] and using the case fatality rate for the city of 2,0%, the maximum number of cases would be reached on June 1 with 195 666 (prevalence). However, when comparing the observed with the expected cases, at the beginning the observed occurrence was above the projected, but then the trend changes decreasing the slope. Conclusions SEIR epidemiological models are widely used methods for projecting cases in infectious diseases, however it must be taken into account that they are deterministic models that can use assumed parameters and could generate imprecise results. © 2020, Universidad Nacional de Colombia.

In order to understand the origins of both approaches as mean-field approximations of integer and fractional stochastic processes, we introduce the fractional differential equations (FDEs) as approximations of some type of fractional nonlinear birth and death processes. Then, we examine validity of the two approaches against empirical courses of epidemics; we fit both of them to case counts of three measles epidemics that occurred during the pre-vaccination era in three different locations. While ordinary differential equations (ODEs) are commonly used to model epidemics, FDEs are more flexible in fitting empirical data and theoretically offer improved model predictions. The question arises whether, in practice, the benefits of using FDEs over ODEs outweigh the added computational complexities. While important differences in transient dynamics were observed, the FDE only outperformed the ODE in one of out three data sets. In general, FDE modeling approaches may be worth it in situations with large refined data sets and good numerical algorithms. © 2020 by the authors.

Many articles have predicted the development of the epidemic. Most of them only use very basic SEIR model without considering the real situation. In this paper, we build a model called e-ISHR model based on SEIR model. Then we add hospital system and time delay system into the original model to simulate the spread of COVID-19 better. Besides, in order to take the government’s control and people’s awareness into consideration, we change our e-ISHR model into a 3-staged model which effectively shows the impact of these factors on the spread of the disease. By using this e-ISHR model, we fit and predict the number of confirmed cases in Wuhan and China except Hubei. We also change some of parameters in our model. The results indicate the importance of isolation and increasing the number of beds in hospital. © 2020, Shanghai Jiao Tong University and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","A; coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); epidemic prediction, 3-staged model; government’s control; hospital system; O 193","Delay control systems; Hospitals; Coronaviruses; Model-based OPC; Original model; Preliminary assessment; Real situation; Seir models; Time-delay systems; Disease control","Li, Q., Guanx, H., Wu, P., Early transmission dynamics in Wuhan, China, of novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia [J] (2020) The New England Journal of Medicine; Imai, N., Dorigatti, I., Cori, A., (2020) Estimating the potential total number of novel coronavirus cases in Wuhan City, China [EB/OL], , https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperialcollege/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/2019-nCoV-outbreak-report-22-01-2020.pdf; Nishiura, H., Jung, S.M., Linton, N.M., The extent of transmission of novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China, 2020 [J] (2020) Journal of Clinical Medicine, 9 (2), p. 330; Riou, J., Althaus, C.L., Pattern of early humanto- human transmission of Wuhan 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), December 2019 to January 2020 [J] (2020) Euro Surveillance, 25 (4), p. 2000058; Majumder, M.S., Mandl, K.D., (2020) Early Transmissibility Assessment of a Novel Coronavirus in Wuhan, China [EB/OL]; Chinazzi, M., Davis, J.T., Gioannini, C., (2020) Preliminary assessment of the international spreading risk associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak in Wuhan City [R], , Northeastern University, Boston, MA, USA; Du, Z.W., Wang, L., Cauchemez, S., Risk for transportation of 2019 novel coronavirus disease from Wuhan to other cities in China [J] (2020) Emerging Infectious Diseases, 26 (5), p. 20146; Backer, J.A., Klinkenberg, D., Wallinga, J., Incubation period of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infections among travellers from Wuhan, China, 20–28 January 2020 [J] (2020) Euro Surveillance, 25 (5), p. 2000062; Wu, J.T., Leung, K., Leung, G.M., Nowcasting and forecasting the potential domestic and international spread of the 2019-nCoV outbreak originating in Wuhan, China: A modelling study [J] (2020) The Lancet, 395, pp. 689-697; Zhan, C.J., Tse, C.K., Fu, Y.X., Modeling and prediction of the 2019 coronavirus disease spreading in China incorporating human migration data [J] (2020) The Lancet; Guo, Q., Li, M., Wang, C.H., (2020) Host and infectivity prediction of Wuhan 2019 novel coronavirus using deep learning algorithm [EB/OL]; Wu, P., Hao, X.X., Lau, E.H.Y., Real-time tentative assessment of the epidemiological characteristics of novel coronavirus infections in Wuhan, China, as at 22 January 2020 [J] (2020) Euro Surveillance, 25 (3), p. 2000044","J.

Settings and Design: Cumulative confirmed and cumulative recovered cases of COVID-19 in India are taken to forecast the prevalence of incoming 3 weeks. Subjects and Methods: The model is built to predict the number of confirmed cases and recovered cases based on the data available from March 14, 2020, to April 26, 2020. Statistical Analysis Used: The autoregressive-integrated moving average model was applied to predict the number of confirmed cases and recovered cases of COVID-19 during the next 3 weeks. Results: Our forecasts suggest a continuing increase in the confirmed COVID-19 cases with sizable associated uncertainty assuming that the data used are reliable and that the future will continue to follow the past pattern of the disease. Conclusions: The timeline of a live-forecasting exercise with potential implications for planning and decision making is described.

Methods: Based on SEIR dynamic model, considering the COVID-19 transmission mechanism, infection spectrum and prevention and control procedures, we developed SEIR(+CAQ) dynamic model to fit the frequencies of laboratory confirmed cases obtained from the government official websites. The data from January 20, 2020 to February 7, 2020 were used to fit the model, while the left data between February 8-12 were used to evaluate the quality of forecasting. Results: According to the cumulative number of confirmed cases between January 29 to February 7, the fitting bias of SEIR(+CAQ) model for overall China (except for cases of Hubei province), Hubei province (except for cases of Wuhan city) and Wuhan city was less than 5%. For the data of subsequent 5 days between February 8 to 12, which were not included in the model fitting, the prediction biases were less than 10%. Regardless of the cases diagnosed by clinical examines, the numbers of daily emerging cases of China (Hubei province not included), Hubei Province (Wuhan city not included) and Wuhan city reached the peak in the early February. Under the current strength of prevention and control, the total number of laboratory-confirmed cases in overall China will reach 80 417 till February 29, 2020, respectively.

Economies of umpteen governments of the world are strained. Virus is selfpostulating affecting many cultures of the world.Incarnated as a tumultuous pandemic changing many governments’walks and expectations. Cases in number uncountable and unaccountable resulted as burden on security and healthcare systems. As data sets are tender and virus reflecting many behavioural qualities, predicting the loss and behaviour of the virus appears as biased. We have shown in this article information-driven methods of forecasting the numbers of COVID-19 cases in Saudi Arabia 60 days ahead and impacts of protective steps such as social isolations or lockout of COVID-19 in the future, using the different machine learning models such as Sigmoid fitting, SEIR model and LSTM. The affected states are analysed in the model as susceptible (S), exposed (E), infected (I), and resistant (R) and a model is developed which is tested with intervention and without intervention. An SEIR model is a family of factor models for the purposes of time series analysis and forecasting. Usage of raw data by separating an event from the preceding event to render the time series set.

Traditionally, ILI surveillance data are updated weekly and provided at a spatially coarse resolution. Producing timely and reliable high-resolution spatiotemporal forecasts for ILI is crucial for local preparedness and optimal interventions. We present Theory-guided Deep Learning-based Epidemic Forecasting with Synthetic Information (TDEFSI),1 an epidemic forecasting framework that integrates the strengths of deep neural networks and high-resolution simulations of epidemic processes over networks. TDEFSI yields accurate high-resolution spatiotemporal forecasts using low-resolution time-series data. During the training phase, TDEFSI uses high-resolution simulations of epidemics that explicitly model spatial and social heterogeneity inherent in urban regions as one component of training data. We train a two-branch recurrent neural network model to take both within-season and between-season low-resolution observations as features and output high-resolution detailed forecasts. The resulting forecasts are not just driven by observed data but also capture the intricate social, demographic, and geographic attributes of specific urban regions and mathematical theories of disease propagation over networks. We focus on forecasting the incidence of ILI and evaluate TDEFSI's performance using synthetic and real-world testing datasets at the state and county levels in the USA. The results show that, at the state level, our method achieves comparable/better performance than several state-of-the-art methods. At the county level, TDEFSI outperforms the other methods. The proposed method can be applied to other infectious diseases as well. © 2020 ACM.","causal model; deep neural network; Epidemic forecasting; LSTM; physical consistency; synthetic information","Backpropagation; Deep neural networks; Diseases; Epidemiology; Inspection; Recurrent neural networks; Disease propagation; High resolution simulations; Infectious disease; Mathematical theory; Optimal intervention; Real-world testing; Recurrent neural network model; State-of-the-art methods; Forecasting; algorithm; artificial neural network; disease prevalence; economic analysis; epidemic; forecasting method; influenza; information technology; numerical model; spatiotemporal analysis; theoretical study","(2009) 2009-2013 5-Year American Community Survey Commuting Flows, , https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/commuting/commuting-flows.html, ACS-2013, Retrieved from; (2017) Hospital Visits for A Population, , https://www.ahrq.gov/data/resources/index.html, AHRQ, Retrieved June 1, 2017 from; Alessa, A., Faezipour, M., A review of influenza detection and prediction through social networking sites (2018) Theor.

Outside of China, Italy is one of the countries suffering the most with the COVID-19 epidemic. It is important to predict the epidemic trend of the COVID-19 epidemic in Italy to help develop public health strategies. Methods: We used time-series data of COVID-19 from Jan 22 2020 to Apr 02 2020. An infectious disease dynamic extended susceptible-infected-removed (eSIR) model, which covers the effects of different intervention measures in dissimilar periods, was applied to estimate the epidemic trend in Italy. The basic reproductive number was estimated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods and presented using the resulting posterior mean and 95% credible interval (CI). Hunan, with a similar total population number to Italy, was used as a comparative item. Results: In the eSIR model, we estimated that the mean of basic reproductive number for COVID-19 was 4.34 (95% CI, 3.04–6.00) in Italy and 3.16 (95% CI, 1.73–5.25) in Hunan. There would be a total of 182 051 infected cases (95%CI:116 114–274 378) under the current country blockade and the endpoint would be Aug 05 in Italy. Conclusion: Italy's current strict measures can efficaciously prevent the further spread of COVID-19 and should be maintained. Necessary strict public health measures should be implemented as soon as possible in other European countries with a high number of COVID-19 cases.

The change trend of infected persons is studied, and the influence of government administrative actions on the trend is analyzed. The results showed that after January 24th, 2020, the administrative action of the government has effectively slowed down the spread virus and the number of infected people decreased obviously. The number of current infections had reduced more than a half compared with the previous trend forecast according the trend of January 24th, 2020. The number of susceptible persons, the probability of infection and the latent infection rate were all greatly reduced.

As consequences, existed models are impractical for real-time forecasting of the COVID-19 trend. Therefore, this study provides a real-time trend forecasting model called extreme IR model with the propagation law. Based on SIR model, the propagation of COVID-19 is simplified to three states. Also, the model uses extreme learning machine to generate the parameters of each state. As a result, the proposed model can evaluate time-variant parameter and predict the number of confirmed cases, dead cases and recovered cases during spreading process. The experiment demonstrates that the extreme IR model achieves accurate real-time prediction. Hence, this paper provides an effective approach to analyze the trend of the diseases. © 2020, Editorial Board of Journal of the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China.

The model fitting with result analysis is performed by utilizing COVID-19 data from 25 January 2020 to 22 February 2020. And then the fitted model is used to simulate the evolution after February 22, 2020. The results show that the introduction of 'undiscovered people' has a significant improvement in fitting and prediction performance, reducing the fitting error by 50% to 70%. The fitting coefficient shows that the virus-laden population accounted for 30% and 5% of exposed people, respectively, in the early and late stages of epidemic. The diagnosed probability of virus-laden population has increased from 7% to 40%, which shows that nucleic acid detection technology is becoming matured. Initial number of undiscovered people is about 70 000, and under effective national control, it is currently controlled at about 2 500.

Regardless of advances in science and technology, equipped laboratories of virology, high literacy rates, and medical resources in developed countries, several nations and their health care systems completely failed to overcome the disaster. The fast spread is caused by frequent air travel for business, tourism, education, etc. COVID-19 can infect third world countries severely. United States of America has the highest per capita spending of health still 1/3rd of the global burden of COVID-19 has consumed existing resources. The WHO has declared COVID-19 as a pandemic. More than 200 countries and territories have reported infected cases. The quarantine is the most effective way to slow the spread of disease and “Flatting of Curve” is a phenomenon to tackle the surge by health systems. To achieve good results from existing Medical Health Care Systems (MHCS), an accurate prediction for the spread of disease is crucial. This study utilizes the generalized method of SIR to accurately predict the spread of COVID-19 associated infection, recoveries, and deaths in Pakistan. The data from the National Command and Control of Pakistan (NCCP) is utilized. Through multiple cases applied on currently available data, the proposed mathematical models predict that by the end of April about more than 14553 infected and about 310 deaths are in Pakistan.

The number of total infected cases has increased to 3662 on 05 April 2020, leading to the country being placed under lockdown. As the main public concern is whether the current situation will continue for the next few months, this study aims to predict the epidemic peak using the Susceptible–Exposed–Infectious–Recovered (SEIR) model, with incorporation of the mortality cases. The infection rate was estimated using the Genetic Algorithm (GA), while the Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) model was used to provide short-time forecasting of the number of infected cases. The results show that the estimated infection rate is 0.228 ± 0.013, while the basic reproductive number is 2.28 ± 0.13. The epidemic peak of COVID-19 in Malaysia could be reached on 26 July 2020, with an uncertain period of 30 days (12 July–11 August). Possible interventions by the government to reduce the infection rate by 25% over two or three months would delay the epidemic peak by 30 and 46 days, respectively. The forecasting results using the ANFIS model show a low Normalized Root Mean Square Error (NRMSE) of 0.041; a low Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 2.45%; and a high coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.9964. The results also show that an intervention has a great effect on delaying the epidemic peak and a longer intervention period would reduce the epidemic size at the peak. The study provides important information for public health providers and the government to control the COVID-19 epidemic. © 2020 by the authors.

At the time of writing, COVID-19 in Wuhan appears to be in the final phase and under control. However, many other countries, especially the US, Italy and Spain, are still in the early phases and dealing with increasing cases every day. Therefore, this article aims to summarise and share the experience of controlling the spread of COVID-19 in Wuhan and provide effective suggestions to enable other countries to save lives. Study design: Data from the National Health Commission of China are used to investigate the evolution trajectory of COVID-19 in Wuhan and discuss the impacts of the intervention strategies. Methods: A four-stage modified Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed (SEIR) model is presented. This model considers many influencing factors, including chunyun (the Spring festival), sealing off the city and constructing the Fangcang shelter hospitals. In addition, a novel method is proposed to address the abnormal data on 12–13 February as a result of changing diagnostic criteria. Four different scenarios are considered to capture different intervention measures in practice. The exposed population in Wuhan who moved out before sealing off the city have also been identified, and an analysis on where they had gone was performed using the Baidu Migration Index. Results: The results demonstrate that the four-stage model was effective in forecasting the peak, size and duration of COVID-19. We found that the combined intervention measures are the only effective way to control the spread and not a single one of them can be omitted. We estimate that England will be another epicentre owing to its incorrect response at the initial stages of COVID-19. Fortunately, big data technology can help provide early warnings to new areas of the pandemic. Conclusions: The four-stage SEIR model was effective in capturing the evolution trajectory of COVID-19. Based on the model analysis, several effective suggestions are proposed to prevent and control the pandemic for countries that are still in the initial phases. © 2020 The Royal Society for Public Health","COVID-19; Intervention strategies; Modelling; Modified SEIR model","COVID-19; epidemic; health risk; hospital sector; public health; trajectory; viral disease; World Health Organization; Article; basic reproduction number; China; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; epidemic; forecasting; human; illness trajectory; infection control; major clinical study; pandemic; prediction; quarantine; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; statistical model; susceptible exposed infectious removed model; virus transmission; biological model; Coronavirus infection; pandemic; virus pneumonia; China; Hubei; Italy; Spain; United States; Wuhan; Coronavirus; China; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Models, Biological; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral","Coronavirus disease (COVID-2019) situation reports https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports, Available online: (Accessed 23 March 2020); The real-time data report of COVID-19 https://voice.baidu.com/act/newpneumonia/newpneumonia/?from=osari_pc_1, Available online: (Accessed 23 March 2020); Parr, J., Pneumonia in China: lack of information raises concerns among Hong Kong health workers (2020) BMJ, 368, p. m56. , (Accessed 8 January 2020); Yang, Z.F., Zeng, Z.Q., Wang, K., Wong, S.S., Liang, W.H., Zanin, M., Modified SEIR and AI prediction of the epidemics trend of COVID-19 in China under public health interventions (2020) J Thorac Dis, 12 (3), pp. 165-174; World Health Organization, MERS situation update (2019), http://applications.emro.who.int/docs/EMROPub_2019_MERA_apr_EN_23513.pdf?ua=1, (Accessed 20 August 2019); Hui, D.S., Azhar, E.I., Madani, T.A., Ntoum, F., Kock, R., Dar, D., The continuing 2019-nCoV epidemic threat of novel coronaviruses to global health -The latest 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan, China (2020) Int J Infect Dis, 91, pp. 264-266; Arenas, A.J., González, P.G., Chen, C.B.M., Dynamical analysis of the transmission of seasonal diseases using the differential transformation method (2009) Math Comput Model, 50 (5-6), pp. 765-776; Büyüktahtakın, İ., Des-Bordes, E., Kibis, E., A new epidemics-logistics model: insights into controlling the ebola virus disease in west africa (2018) Eur J Oper Res, 265 (3), pp. 1046-1063; Special expert group for control of the epidemic of novel coronavirus pneumonia of the Chinese preventive medicine association.

Corona virus, also known as COVID-19 was first originated in Wuhan, Hubei province in China around December 2019 and spread out all over the world within few weeks. Based on the public datasets provided by John Hopkins university and Canadian health authority, we have developed a forecasting model of COVID-19 outbreak in Canada using state-of-the-art Deep Learning (DL) models. In this novel research, we evaluated the key features to predict the trends and possible stopping time of the current COVID-19 outbreak in Canada and around the world. In this paper we presented the Long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, a deep learning approach to forecast the future COVID-19 cases. Based on the results of our Long short-term memory (LSTM) network, we predicted the possible ending point of this outbreak will be around June 2020. In addition to that, we compared transmission rates of Canada with Italy and USA. Here we also presented the 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 14th day predictions for 2 successive days. Our forecasts in this paper is based on the available data until March 31, 2020. To the best of our knowledge, this of the few studies to use LSTM networks to forecast the infectious diseases. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Corona virus; COVID-19; Epidemic transmission; Long short term memory (LSTM) networks;

In Indonesia, hoaxes are common that it becomes a serious problem. We predicted the spread of hoaxes in Indonesia by using the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Susceptible (SIRS) epidemic model where the susceptible is the person who ignores the news, the infected is the person who shares the news without fact-checking it, and the recovered is the person who fact-checks the news. This paper uses data from the Indonesia Telematics Society (MASTEL) concerning the behavior of Indonesian people in 2017 and 2019 when receiving trending news. We also use data on the number of internet users in Indonesia obtained from the Indonesia Internet Service Providers Association (APJII). This model has a disease-free equilibrium which is unstable and an endemic equilibrium which is asymptotically stable. The basic reproduction number of this model, which is 5.614455426, shows that the spread of hoaxes in Indonesia will increase because the behavior of sharing the news without fact-checking it will spread in the society until it reaches endemic equilibrium. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Cell proliferation; Asymptotically stable; Basic reproduction number; Disease-free equilibrium; Endemic equilibrium; Epidemic modeling; Internet users; SIRS models; Telematics; Epidemiology","Mastel, (2019) Hasil Survey Wabah Hoax Nasional 2019; Kominfo, Kominfo Identifikasi 486 Hoaks Selama April 2019, Total Hoaks Sejak Agustus 2018 Sebanyak 1.731 (2019) Official Website of the Ministry of Communication and Information Technology Republic of Indonesia; Kominfo, 771 Hoax Berhasil Diidentifikasi Kominfo (2019) Official Website of the Ministry of Communication and Information Technology Republic of Indonesia; Pennycook, G., Cannon, T., Rand, D., Prior Exposure Increases Perceived Accuracy of Fake News (2017) Ssrn Electronic Journal; Kermack, W., McKendrick, A., A Contribution to the Mathematical Theory of Epidemics (1927) Proceedings of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences, 115, pp. 700-721; Henson, S., Brauer, F., Castillo-Chavez, C., Mathematical Models in Population Biology and Epidemiology (2003) The American Mathematical Monthly, 110 (3), p. 254; Bastin, G., (2018) Lectures on Mathematical Modelling of Biological Systems; Apjii, (2019) Penetrasi Dan Profil Perilaku Pengguna Internet Indonesia; Mastel, (2017) Hasil Survey Mastel Tentang Wabah Hoax Nasional","J.

The challenges of having only lacunary information about daily new infections and mortality counts are compounded by geographic heterogeneity of the population. This complicates prediction, particularly when using models assuming well-mixed populations. To address this problem, we account for the differences between rural and urban settings using network-based, distributed models where the spread of the pandemic is described in distinct local cohorts with nested SE(A)IR models, i.e., modified SEIR models that include infectious asymptomatic individuals. The model parameters account for the SARS-CoV-2 transmission mostly via human-to-human contact, and the fact that contact frequency among individuals differs between urban and rural areas, and may change over time. The probability that the virus spreads into an uninfected community is associated with influx of individuals from communities where the infection is already present, thus each node is characterized by its internal contact and by its connectivity with other nodes. Census data are used to set up the adjacency matrix of the network, which can be modified to simulate changes in mitigation measures. Our network SE(A)IR model depends on easily interpretable parameters estimated from available community level data. The parameters estimated with Bayesian techniques include transmission rate and the ratio asymptomatic to symptomatic infectious individuals. The methodology predicts that the latter quantity approaches 0.5 as the epidemic reaches an equilibrium, in full agreement with the May 22, 2020 CDC modeling. The network model gives rise to a spatially distributed computational model that explains the geographic dynamics of the contagion, e.g., in larger cities surrounded by suburban and rural areas. The time courses of the infected cohorts in the different counties predicted by the network model are remarkably similar to the reported observations. Moreover, the model shows that monitoring the infection prevalence in each county, and adopting local mitigation measures as infections climb beyond a certain threshold, is almost as effective as blanket measures, and more effective than reducing inter-county mobility. © Copyright © 2020 Calvetti, Hoover, Rose and Somersalo.","Bayesian parameter estimation; connectivity matrix; particle filter; predictive envelopes; SEIR model; uncertainty quantification",,"Perc, M., Gorišek, M.N., Slavinec, M., Stožer, A., Forecasting Covid-19 (2020) Front Phys, 8, p. 127; Kermack, W.O., McKendrick, A., A contribution to the mathematical theory of epidemic (1927) Proc R Soc Lond, 115, pp. 700-721; Anderson, R.M., May, R.M., Directly transmitted infections diseases: control by vaccination (1982) Science, 215, pp. 1053-1060. , 7063839; Anderson, R.M., May, R.M., Vaccination and herd immunity to infectious diseases (1985) Nature, 318, pp. 323-329. , 3906406; Keeling, M.J., Rohani, P., (2011) Modeling Infectious Diseases in Humans and Animals, , Princeton, NJ, Princeton University Press; Levins, R., Some demographic and genetic consequences of environmental heterogeneity for biological control (1969) Am Entomol, 15, pp. 237-240; Perra, N., Balcan, D., Gonçalves, B., Vespignani, A., Towards a characterization of behavior-disease models (2011) PLoS ONE, 6, p. e23084. , 21826228; Wang, L., Li, X., Spatial epidemiology of networked metapopulation: an overview (2014) Chinese Sci Bull, 59, pp. 3511-3522. , 32214746; Balcan, D., Hu, H., Goncalves, B., Bajardi, P., Poletto, C., Ramasco, J.J., Seasonal transmission potential and activity peaks of the new influenza A (H1N1): a Monte Carlo likelihood analysis based on human mobility (2009) BMC Med, 7, p. 45. , 19744314; Balcan, D., Vespignani, A., Phase transitions in contagion processes mediated by recurrent mobility patterns (2011) Nat Phys, 7, pp. 581-586. , 21799702; Balcan, D., Vespignani, A., Invasion threshold in structured populations with recurrent mobility patterns (2012) J Theor Biol, 293, pp. 87-100. , 22019505; Ajelli, M., Gonçalves, B., Balcan, D., Colizza, V., Hu, H., Ramasco, J.J., Comparing large-scale computational approaches to epidemic modeling: agent-based versus structured metapopulation models (2010) BMC Infect Dis, 10, p. 190. , 20587041; Hollingsworth, T.D., Ferguson, N.M., Anderson, R.M., Will travel restrictions control the international spread of pandemic influenza?

Prediction of the number of persons carrying the live COVID-19 coronavirus (I) in a susceptible population (S) was achieved using two rate constants describing the rate of increase and decrease in the number of infectious persons on a daily basis. The model was verified using observational data for the city of Heidelberg, Germany. Three hypothetical scenarios, having their counterparts in practice were considered, namely Scenario A-No restrictions on the population; Scenario B-Assumption of a 10-fold higher number of infections than observed; Scenario C-Protective measures introduced only for elderly persons. It could be demonstrated using the model that the lockdown measures introduced prevented a major medical emergency and possibly a near catastrophe in the region. It was further demonstrated that the prospective application of the model can facilitate realtime decisions on pandemic management strategy for the population. This is achieved by curve-fitting for the rate constants, determinants for the number of infectious persons. The calculated maximum numbers of infected and infectious persons daily increased in proportion to the number of persons initially susceptible to the infection. After appearance of the first two infections in Heidelberg, the calculated maximum number of persons carrying live virus was 2,291 at Day 102 (Scenario B), 18,936 infectious persons at Day 139 (Scenario C) and 22,535 infectious at Day 142 (Scenario A). In Scenario A, high values would have persisted for 6 months during which a total of 124,301 persons would have been infected in Heidelberg. The model predicted that the virus would have disappeared within 1 year after being first detected. A disease catastrophe of this magnitude would not be expected provided the rate constant (α) for the rate of increase in the number of infectious persons remained lower than the rate constant (β) for the fall in number of infectious persons. © 2020 Dustri-Verlag Dr. K.

In this work, we employed the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model to forecast the expected daily number of COVID-19 cases in Saudi Arabia in the next four weeks. We first performed four different prediction models; Autoregressive Model, Moving Average, a combination of both (ARMA), and integrated ARMA (ARIMA), to determine the best model fit, and we found out that the ARIMA model outperformed the other models. The forecasting results showed that the trend in Saudi Arabia will continue growing and may reach up to 7668 new cases per day and over 127,129 cumulative daily cases in a matter of four weeks if stringent precautionary and control measures are not implemented to limit the spread of COVID-19. This indicates that the Umrah and Hajj Pilgrimages to the two holy cities of Mecca and Medina in Saudi Arabia that are supposedly scheduled to be performed by nearly 2 million Muslims in mid-July may be suspended. A set of extreme preventive and control measures are proposed in an effort to avoid such a situation. © 2020 The Author(s)","COVID-19; mARIMA Prediction Model; Pandemic; SARS-Cov-2; Saudi Arabia; Time Series models","Article; Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average model; city; coronavirus disease 2019; cumulative scale; epidemiological monitoring; human; infection control; major clinical study; Muslim; nonhuman; pandemic; priority journal; public health service; Saudi Arabia; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; virus transmission; Betacoronavirus; biological model; Coronavirus infection; pandemic; procedures; public health; statistical model; time factor; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Models, Biological; Models, Statistical; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Public Health; Saudi Arabia; Time Factors","Cascella, M., Rajnik, M., Cuomo, A., Dulebohn, S.C., Di Napoli, R., Features, evaluation and treatment coronavirus (COVID-19) (2020) StatPearls [Internet], , StatPearls Publishing; Adhikari, S.P., Meng, S., Wu, Y.J., Mao, Y.P., Ye, R.X., Wang, Q.Z., Epidemiology, causes, clinical manifestation and diagnosis, prevention and control of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) during the early outbreak period: a scoping review (2020) Infect Dis Poverty, 9 (1), pp. 1-12; Lai, C.C., Shih, T.P., Ko, W.C., Tang, H.J., Hsueh, P.R., Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and corona virus disease-2019 (COVID-19): the epidemic and the challenges (2020) Int J Antimicrob Agents, 55 (3), p. 105924; Novel, C.P.E.R.E., The epidemiological characteristics of an outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus diseases (COVID-19) in China (2020) Z Liuxingbingxue Zazhi, 41 (2), p. 145; https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html, (accessed 15.04.20); https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/geographical-distribution-2019-ncov-cases, (accessed 15.04.20); Mahalle, P., Kalamkar, A.B., Dey, N., Chaki, J., Hassanien, A., Shinde, G.R., Forecasting models for Coronavirus (COVID-19): a survey of the state-of-the-art (2020) TechRxiv, , Preprint; Petropoulos, F., Makridakis, S., Forecasting the novel coronavirus COVID-19 (2020) PLOS ONE, 15 (3), p. e0231236; Liu, Z., Guo, W., Government responses matter: predicting Covid-19 cases in US under an empirical Bayesian time series framework (2020) medRxiv; Al-qaness, M.A., Ewees, A.A., Fan, H., Abd El Aziz, M., Optimization method for forecasting confirmed cases of COVID-19 in China (2020) J Clin Med, 9 (3), p. 674; Perone, G., An ARIMA model to forecast the spread of COVID-2019 epidemic in Italy. arXiv preprint (2020); Monllor, P., Su, Z., Gabrieli, L., Montoro, A., Taltavull de La Paz, M.D.L.P., COVID-19 infection process in Italy and Spain: are the data talking?

This paper applies an exploratory time-series analysis to the evolution of the disease in Greece, which currently suggests a success story of COVID-19 management. The proposed method builds on a recent conceptualization of detecting connective communities in a time-series and develops a novel spline regression model where the knot vector is determined by the community detection in the complex network. Overall, the study contributes to the COVID-19 research by proposing a free of disconnected past-data and reliable framework of forecasting, which can facilitate decision-making and management of the available health resources. © 2020 by the authors.

Significant changes in Rt can forewarn about new transmissions within a population or predict the efficacy of interventions. Inferring Rt reliably and in real-time from observed time-series of infected (demographic) data is an important problem in population dynamics. The renewal or branching process model is a popular solution that has been applied to Ebola and Zika virus disease outbreaks, among others, and is currently being used to investigate the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. This model estimates Rt using a heuristically chosen piecewise function. While this facilitates real-time detection of statistically significant Rt changes, inference is highly sensitive to the function choice. Improperly chosen piecewise models might ignore meaningful changes or over-interpret noise-induced ones, yet produce visually reasonable estimates. No principled piecewise selection scheme exists. We develop a practical yet rigorous scheme using the accumulated prediction error (APE) metric from information theory, which deems the model capable of describing the observed data using the fewest bits as most justified. We derive exact posterior prediction distributions for infected population size and integrate these within an APE framework to obtain an exact and reliable method for identifying the piecewise function best supported by available epidemic data. We find that this choice optimises short-term prediction accuracy and can rapidly detect salient fluctuations in Rt, and hence the infected population growth rate, in real-time over the course of an unfolding epidemic. Moreover, we emphasise the need for formal selection by exposing how common heuristic choices, which seem sensible, can be misleading. Our APE-based method is easily computed and broadly applicable to statistically similar models found in phylogenetics and macroevolution, for example. Our results explore the relationships among estimate precision, forecast reliability and model complexity. © 2020 Parag, Donnelly.

First, a new data driven approach for predicting the Covid-19 pandemic dynamics is introduced. The second contribution consists in reporting and discussing the results that were obtained with this approach for the Brazilian states, with predictions starting as of 4 May 2020. As a preliminary study, we first used an Long Short Term Memory for Data Training-SAE (LSTM-SAE) network model. Although this first approach led to somewhat disappointing results, it served as a good baseline for testing other ANN types. Subsequently, in order to identify relevant countries and regions to be used for training ANN models, we conduct a clustering of the world’s regions where the pandemic is at an advanced stage. This clustering is based on manually engineered features representing a country’s response to the early spread of the pandemic, and the different clusters obtained are used to select the relevant countries for training the models. The final models retained are Modified Auto-Encoder networks, that are trained on these clusters and learn to predict future data for Brazilian states. These predictions are used to estimate important statistics about the disease, such as peaks and number of confirmed cases. Finally, curve fitting is carried out to find the distribution that best fits the outputs of the MAE, and to refine the estimates of the peaks of the pandemic. Predicted numbers reach a total of more than one million infected Brazilians, distributed among the different states, with São Paulo leading with about 150 thousand confirmed cases predicted. The results indicate that the pandemic is still growing in Brazil, with most states peaks of infection estimated in the second half of May 2020. The estimated end of the pandemics (97% of cases reaching an outcome) spread between June and the end of August 2020, depending on the states. © 2020 by the authors.

The goal of this study was to apply a modified susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) compartmental mathematical model for prediction of COVID-19 epidemic dynamics incorporating pathogen in the environment and interventions. The next generation matrix approach was used to determine the basic reproduction number R_0 R 0. The model equations are solved numerically using fourth and fifth order Runge-Kutta methods. Results: We found an R_0 R 0 of 2.03, implying that the pandemic will persist in the human population in the absence of strong control measures. Results after simulating various scenarios indicate that disregarding social distancing and hygiene measures can have devastating effects on the human population. The model shows that quarantine of contacts and isolation of cases can help halt the spread on novel coronavirus. © 2020 The Author(s).","Basic reproduction number; COVID-19 dynamics; Mathematical model; Runge-Kutta method; SEIR model; Social distancing","Betacoronavirus; contact examination; convalescence; Coronavirus infection; disease predisposition; environmental exposure; forecasting; hand washing; human; infection control; mask; pandemic; patient compliance; patient isolation; procedures; protocol compliance; quarantine; theoretical model; time factor; travel; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Contact Tracing; Convalescence; Coronavirus Infections; Disease Susceptibility; Environmental Exposure; Forecasting; Guideline Adherence; Hand Hygiene; Humans; Infection Control; Masks; Models, Theoretical; Pandemics; Patient Compliance; Patient Isolation; Pneumonia, Viral; Quarantine; Time Factors; Travel","Chen, N., Zhou, M., Dong, X., Qu, J., Gong, F., Han, Y., Qiu, Y., Wei, Y., Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 99 cases of 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan, China: A descriptive study (2020) Lancet, 395 (10223), pp. 507-513. , 1:CAS:528:DC%2BB3cXhvFOmsb8%3D; (2020) Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): Situation Report, 51. , WHO; Hsieh, Y.-H., 2015 Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) nosocomial outbreak in south korea: Insights from modeling (2015) PeerJ, 3, p. 1505; Kim, Y., Lee, S., Chu, C., Choe, S., Hong, S., Shin, Y., The characteristics of middle eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus transmission dynamics in South Korea (2016) Osong Public Health Res Perspect, 7 (1), pp. 49-55; Chen, T.-M., Rui, J., Wang, Q.-P., Zhao, Z.-Y., Cui, J.-A., Yin, L., A mathematical model for simulating the phase-based transmissibility of a novel coronavirus (2020) Infect Dis Poverty, 9 (1), pp. 1-8; Sookaromdee, P., Wiwanitkit, V., Imported cases of 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-ncov) infections in Thailand: Mathematical modelling of the outbreak (2020) Asian Pac J Trop Med, 13 (3), pp. 139-140","BMC Res.

To predict the future suspect infection and death cases, we categorized the approaches found in the literature into: first, a purely data-driven approach, whose goal is to build a mathematical model that relates the data variables including outputs with inputs to detect general patterns. The discovered patterns can then be used to predict the future infected cases without any expert input. The second approach is partially data-driven; it uses historical data, but allows expert input such as the SIR epidemic algorithm. This approach assumes that the epidemic will end according to medical reasoning. In this paper, we compare the purely data-driven and partially-data driven approaches by applying them to data from three countries having different past pattern behavior. The countries are the US, Jordan, and Italy. It is found that those two prediction approaches yield significantly different results. Purely data-driven approach depends totally on the past behavior and does not show any decline in the number of the infected cases if the country did not experience any decline in the number of cases. On the other hand, a partially data-driven approach guarantees a timely decline of the infected curve to reach zero. Using the two approaches highlights the importance of human intervention in pandemic prediction to guide the learning process as opposed to the purely data-driven approach that predicts future cases based on the pattern detected in the data. © 2020 by the authors.","Corona virus detection; Exponential regression; Exponential smoothing model; Infected cases prediction; Linear regression; Partially data-driven approach; Purely data-driven approach; SIR model",,"WHO Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Dashboard https://covid19.who.int/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI-5Coica_6gIVhIbVCh1lpA4DEAAYASAAEgJdHvD_BwE, (accessed on 8 July 2020); Seber, G.A., Lee, A.J., Linear Regression Analysis (2012), 329. , John Wiley & Sons: Hoboken, NJ, USA; Ghosal, S., Sengupta, S., Majumder, M., Sinha, B., Prediction of the number of deaths in India due to SARS-CoV-2 at 5-6 weeks (2020) Diabetes Metab.

Drawing upon the seminal susceptible–infected–removed (SIR) model of capturing the spread of viral diseases, this study models the spread of COVID-19 in the ten most infected states of India (as on 30 April 2020). Using publicly available state-wise time series data of COVID-19 patients during the period 1–30 April 2020, the study uses the forecasting technique of auto-regressive integrated moving averages (ARIMA) to predict the likely population susceptible to COVID-19 in each state. Thereafter, based on the SIR model, predictive modelling of state-wise COVID-19 data is carried out to determine: (a) the predictive accuracy; (b) the likely number of days it would take for the disease to reach the peak number of infections in a state; (c) the likely number of infections at the peak; and (d) the state-wise end date. The SIR model is implemented by running Python 3.7.4 on Jupyter Notebook and using the package Matplotlib 3.2.1 for visualization. The study offers rich insights for policymakers as well as common citizens. © 2020 International Management Institute, New Delhi.","ARIMA; COVID-19; India; predictive analytics; SIR model",,"Banik, A., Nag, T., Chowdhury, S.R., Chatterjee, R., Why do COVID-19 fatality rates differ across countries?

We have used the modified Bateman SIZ algorithm to predict the effects of interventional measures to control the COVID-19 pandemic. Materials and methods: Model parameters, e.g., doubling time and rate of decrease in the number of infectious persons were obtained from published reports. Predictions were made for the status quo on June 1, 2020, and for interventional measures obtained for 4 scenarios. These included vaccination of the whole population using a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine having an efficacy of 50% and 100%, mass-testing for COVID-19 coronavirus and application of the Corona-Warn-App. Results: The principle findings were 1) without new measures to control the pandemic, the daily number of infectious persons could reach a peak of >4,500 daily within 18 months when >67,000 persons would have been infected. This could be prevented by using a vaccine with 50% efficacy which was almost equally effective as a vaccine with 100% efficacy. Application of the Corona-Warn-App was the most effective method and more effective than testing for COVID- 19. The methodology used has been described in detail to enable other researchers to apply the modified Bateman SIZ model to obtain predictions for COVID-19 outbreaks in other regions. Application of the model has been verified by independent investigators using different commercial software packages. Conclusion: The modified Bateman SIZ model has been verified and used to predict the course of the COVID-19 pandemic in Heidelberg. Lockdown measures alone are insufficient to control the pandemic during 2021. Vaccination, diagnostic tests, and use of the Corona- Warn-App with quarantine could successfully control the spread of the coronavirus infection in the community. The Corona-Warn-App applied correctly may be the most effective. The model showed that vaccination with 50% efficacy is almost as effective as vaccination with 100% efficacy. © 2020 Dustri-Verlag Dr. Karl Feistle.

It has become the second most affected country worldwide, as of June 9, 2020. Official Brazilian government sources present contradictory data on the impact of the disease; thus, it is possible that the actual number of infected individuals and deaths in Brazil is far larger than those officially reported. It is very likely that the actual spread of the disease has been underestimated. Objective: This study investigates the underreporting of cases and deaths related to COVID-19 in the most affected cities in Brazil, based on public data available from official Brazilian government internet portals, to identify the actual impact of the pandemic. Methods: We used data from historical deaths due to respiratory problems and other natural causes from two public portals: DATASUS (Department of Informatics of the Unified Healthcare System) (2010-2018) and the Brazilian Transparency Portal of Civil Registry (2019-2020). These data were used to build time-series models (modular regressions) to predict the expected mortality patterns for 2020. The forecasts were used to estimate the possible number of deaths that were incorrectly registered during the pandemic and posted on government internet portals in the most affected cities in the country. Results: Our model found a significant difference between the real and expected values. The number of deaths due to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was considerably higher in all cities, with increases between 493% and 5820%. This sudden increase may be associated with errors in reporting. An average underreporting of 40.68% (range 25.9%-62.7%) is estimated for COVID-19-related deaths. Conclusions: The significant rates of underreporting of deaths analyzed in our study demonstrate that officially released numbers are much lower than actual numbers, making it impossible for the authorities to implement a more effective pandemic response. Based on analyses carried out using different fatality rates, it can be inferred that Brazil's epidemic is worsening, and the actual number of infectees could already be between 1 to 5.4 million. © 2020 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

As of April 15, 2020, >1.9 million COVID-19 cases were confirmed worldwide, including >120,000 deaths. There is an urgent need to monitor and predict COVID-19 prevalence to control this spread more effectively. Time series models are significant in predicting the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak and taking the necessary measures to respond to this crisis. In this study, Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models were developed to predict the epidemiological trend of COVID-19 prevalence of Italy, Spain, and France, the most affected countries of Europe. The prevalence data of COVID-19 from 21 February 2020 to 15 April 2020 were collected from the World Health Organization website. Several ARIMA models were formulated with different ARIMA parameters. ARIMA (0,2,1), ARIMA (1,2,0), and ARIMA (0,2,1) models with the lowest MAPE values (4.7520, 5.8486, and 5.6335) were selected as the best models for Italy, Spain, and France, respectively. This study shows that ARIMA models are suitable for predicting the prevalence of COVID-19 in the future. The results of the analysis can shed light on understanding the trends of the outbreak and give an idea of the epidemiological stage of these regions. Besides, the prediction of COVID-19 prevalence trends of Italy, Spain, and France can help take precautions and policy formulation for this epidemic in other countries. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","ARIMA; COVID-19; Forecasting; Infection disease; Pandemic; Time series","Forecasting; ARIMA models; Auto regressive integrated moving average models; Best model; Coronaviruses; Policy formulation; Time series models; World Health Organization; Wuhan cities; Autoregressive moving average model; COVID-19; disease prevalence; epidemiology; estimation method; respiratory disease; time series analysis; trend analysis; analytic method; Article; coronavirus disease 2019; coronavirus disease 209; Coronavirus infection; epidemic; France; health care policy; human; Italy; major clinical study; mathematical model; prediction; prevalence; priority journal; Spain; Betacoronavirus; pandemic; prevalence; virus pneumonia; France; Italy; Spain; Coronavirus; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; France; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Prevalence; Spain","Al-qaness, M.A.A., Ewees, A.A., Fan, H., Aziz, A.E., El, M.A., Optimization method for forecasting confirmed cases of COVID-19 in China (2020) J.

A majority of the world population is now living in a restricted environment for more than a month with minimal economic activities, to prevent exposure to this highly infectious disease. Medical professionals are going through a stressful period while trying to save the larger population. In this paper, we develop two different models to capture the trend of a number of cases and also predict the cases in the days to come, so that appropriate preparations can be made to fight this disease. The first one is a mathematical model accounting for various parameters relating to the spread of the virus, while the second one is a non-parametric model based on the Fourier decomposition method (FDM), fitted on the available data. The study is performed for various countries, but detailed results are provided for the India, Italy, and United States of America (USA). The turnaround dates for the trend of infected cases are estimated. The end-dates are also predicted and are found to agree well with a very popular study based on the classic susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model. Worldwide, the total number of expected cases and deaths are 12.7 × 106 and 5.27 × 105, respectively, predicted with data as of 06-06-2020 and 95% confidence intervals. The proposed study produces promising results with the potential to serve as a good complement to existing methods for continuous predictive monitoring of the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2020","COVID-19; Discrete cosine transform (DCT); Fourier decomposition method (FDM); Gaussian mixture model (GMM); Mathematical model; Susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model","Economics; Gaussian distribution; Viruses; Fourier decomposition; Gaussian Mixture Model; Medical professionals; Modeling and predictions; Non-parametric model; Predictive monitoring; Susceptible-infected-recovered model; United States of America; Disease control","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) situation report–73 (2020) World Health Organization; Zhang, X., Ma, R., Wang, L., Predicting turning point, duration and attack rate of COVID-19 outbreaks in major western countries (2020) Chaos Solitons Fractals, 135, p. 109829; Ghosal, S., Sengupta, S., Majumder, M., Sinha, B., Prediction of the number of deaths in India due to SARS-CoV-2 at 5–6 weeks (2020) Diabetes Metab Syndr, 14, pp. 311-315; Tomar, A., Gupta, N., Prediction for the spread of COVID-19 in India and effectiveness of preventive measures (2020) Sci Total Environ, 728, p. 138762; Fanelli, D., Piazza, F., Analysis and forecast of COVID-19 spreading in China, Italy and France (2020) Chaos Solitons Fractals, 134, p. 109761; Chintalapudi, N., Battineni, G., Amenta, F., COVID-19 disease outbreak forecasting of registered and recovered cases after sixty day lockdown in Italy: a data driven model approach (2020) J Microbiol Immunol Infect, 53 (3), pp. 396-403; Zhong, L., Mu, L., Li, J., Wang, J., Yin, Z., Liu, D., Early prediction of the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak in the mainland China based on simple mathematical model (2020) IEEE Access, 8, pp. 51761-51769; Li, L., Zhang, Q., Wang, X., Zhang, J., Wang, T., Gao, T.-L., Characterizing the propagation of situational information in social media during COVID-19 epidemic: a case study on weibo (2020) IEEE Trans Comput Soc Syst, 7 (2), pp. 556-562; https://ddi.sutd.edu.sg/when-will-covid-19-end/, When will COVID-19 end?

In particular, in our first example we analyze the classical SIRS–V evolution with the addition of movements due to diffusion, while in the second one we focus on modeling one ring vaccination policy. We expect this model can improve spatial predictions of SIR vaccination models by taking into account the spatial dimension of the problem. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Epidemic dynamics; Non-linear system of partial differential equations; Numerical modeling; Spatial SIR model; Vaccination strategy","Linear systems; Spatial dimension; Spatial dynamics; Spatial prediction; Spatial strategies; Temporal dynamics; V-model; Vaccines","Kermack, W.O., McKendrick, A.G., A contribution to the mathematical theory of epidemics (1927) Proceedings of the Royal Society of London A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences, Vol. 115, pp. 700-721. , The Royal Society no. 772; Okubo, A., Diffusion and Ecological Problems; Mathematical Models: Tech.

The virus started from a single human being in China, is now increasing globally at a rate of 3% to 5% daily and has become a never ending process. Some studies even predict that the virus will stay with us forever. India being the second most populous country of the world, is also not saved, and the virus is spreading as a community level transmitter. Therefore, it become really important to analyse the possible impact of COVID-19 in India and forecast how it will behave in the days to come. In present work, prediction models based on genetic programming (GP) have been developed for confirmed cases (CC) and death cases (DC) across three most affected states namely Maharashtra, Gujarat and Delhi as well as whole India. The proposed prediction models are presented using explicit formula, and impotence of prediction variables are studied. Here, statistical parameters and metrics have been used for evaluated and validate the evolved models. From the results, it has been found that the proposed GEP-based models use simple linkage functions and are highly reliable for time series prediction of COVID-19 cases in India. © 2020","Coronavirus; COVID-19; Genetic programming; India; SARS-CoV-2; Time series forecasting","Forecasting; Genetic algorithms; Genetic programming; Viruses; Ending process; Explicit formula; Gujarat; Human being; Prediction model; Simple linkages; Statistical parameters; Time series prediction; Time series analysis","Huang, C., Wang, Y., Li, X., Ren, L., Zhao, J., Hu, Y., Zhang, L., Gu, X., Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in wuhan (2020) China Lancet, 395, pp. 497-506; WHO, Statement regarding cluster of pneumonia cases in wuhan, china; (2020) World Health Organization: Geneva, Switzerland, , https://www.who.int/china/news/detail/09-01-2020-who-statementregarding-cluster-of-pneumonia-cases-in-wuhan-china, Available online: (accessed on 17 February 2020); WHO, Novel coronavirus–thailand (ex-china) (2020) World Health Organization: Geneva, Switzerland, , https://www.who.int/csr/don/14-january-2020-novel-coronavirus-thailand-ex-china/en, Available online: (accessed on 17 February 2020); WHO director-general's opening remarks at the media briefing on COVID-19 – 11 march 2020. 2020.

With no vaccine in sight, the spread of the virus is likely to continue unabated. This article aims to analyze the time series data for top five countries affected by the COVID-19 for forecasting the spread of the epidemic. Material and methods: Daily time series data from 15th February to June 30, 2020 of total infected cases from the top five countries namely US, Brazil, India, Russia and Spain were collected from the online database. ARIMA model specifications were estimated using Hannan and Rissanen algorithm. Out of sample forecast for the next 77 days was computed using the ARIMA models. Results: Forecast for the first 18 days of July was compared with the actual data and the forecast accuracy was using MAD and MAPE were found within acceptable agreement. The graphic plots of forecast data suggest that While Russia and Spain have reached the inflexion point in the spread of epidemic, the US, Brazil and India are still experiencing an exponential curve. Conclusion: Our analysis shows that India and Brazil will hit 1.38 million and 2.47 million mark while the US will reach the 4.29 million mark by 31st July. With no effective cure available at the moment, this forecast will help the governments to be better prepared to combat the epidemic by ramping up their healthcare facilities. © 2020 Diabetes India","ARIMA; COVID-19; Forecasting; Pandemic; SARV-2 Cov","Article; autocorrelation; biosurveillance; Brazil; comparative study; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; econometric model; forecasting; health care facility; human; India; priority journal; random error; Russian Federation; Spain; time series analysis","Coronavirus Update (Live), Cases and 501644 deaths from COVID-19 virus pandemic - worldometer https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/, 10101998 Available at: (Accessed 28 June 2020); Alsudani, R.S.A., Liu, J.C., The use of some of the information criterion in determining the best model for forecasting of thalassemia cases depending on Iraqi patient data using ARIMA model (2017) J Appl Math Phys, 5, pp. 667-679; De, P., Sahu, D., Pandey, A., Gulati, B.K., Chandhiok, N., Shukla, A.K., Post millennium development goals prospect on child mortality in India: an analysis using autoregressive integrated moving averages (ARIMA) model (2016) Health, 8, pp. 1845-1872; Wang, L.Y., Peng, B., Zhou, R., Zhan, C.Y., Liu, Z., Mathematical modeling and epidemic prediction of COVID-19 and its significance to epidemic prevention and control measures (2020) Ann Infect Dis Epidemiol, 5 (1), p. 1052. , 2020; Chadsuthi, S., Modchang, C., Lenbury, Y., Iamsirithaworn, S., Triampo, W., Modeling seasonal leptospirosis transmission and its association with rainfall and temperature in Thailand using time-series and ARIMAX analyses (2012) Asian Pac J Trop Med, 5 (7), pp. 539-546; Unkel, S., Farrington, C.P., Garthwaite, P.H., Robertson, C., Andrews, N., Statistical methods for the prospective detection of infectious disease outbreaks: a review (2011) J Roy Stat Soc, 175 (1), pp. 49-82; Kotwal, A., Yadav, A.K., Yadav, J., Kotwal, J., Khune, S., Predictive models of COVID-19 in India: a rapid review (2020) Med J Armed Forces India Online Pub; Shmueli, G., Burkom, H., Statistical challenges facing early outbreak detection in biosurveillance (2010) Technometrics, 52, pp. 39-51; Rolka, H.R., (2011) Preface.

Leveraging electronic health records (EHRs) to monitor outpatient clinical encounters may lead to the identification of emerging outbreaks. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to investigate whether excess visits where the word ""cough"" was present in the EHR reason for visit, and hospitalizations with acute respiratory failure were more frequent from December 2019 to February 2020 compared with the preceding 5 years. METHODS: A retrospective observational cohort was identified from a large US health system with 3 hospitals, over 180 clinics, and 2.5 million patient encounters annually. Data from patient encounters from July 1, 2014, to February 29, 2020, were included. Seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) time-series models were used to evaluate if the observed winter 2019/2020 rates were higher than the forecast 95% prediction intervals. The estimated excess number of visits and hospitalizations in winter 2019/2020 were calculated compared to previous seasons. RESULTS: The percentage of patients presenting with an EHR reason for visit containing the word ""cough"" to clinics exceeded the 95% prediction interval the week of December 22, 2019, and was consistently above the 95% prediction interval all 10 weeks through the end of February 2020. Similar trends were noted for emergency department visits and hospitalizations starting December 22, 2019, where observed data exceeded the 95% prediction interval in 6 and 7 of the 10 weeks, respectively. The estimated excess over the 3-month 2019/2020 winter season, obtained by either subtracting the maximum or subtracting the average of the five previous seasons from the current season, was 1.6 or 2.0 excess visits for cough per 1000 outpatient visits, 11.0 or 19.2 excess visits for cough per 1000 emergency department visits, and 21.4 or 39.1 excess visits per 1000 hospitalizations with acute respiratory failure, respectively. The total numbers of excess cases above the 95% predicted forecast interval were 168 cases in the outpatient clinics, 56 cases for the emergency department, and 18 hospitalized with acute respiratory failure. CONCLUSIONS: A significantly higher number of patients with respiratory complaints and diseases starting in late December 2019 and continuing through February 2020 suggests community spread of SARS-CoV-2 prior to established clinical awareness and testing capabilities. This provides a case example of how health system analytics combined with EHR data can provide powerful and agile tools for identifying when future trends in patient populations are outside of the expected ranges. ©Joann G Elmore, Pin-Chieh Wang, Kathleen F Kerr, David L Schriger, Douglas E Morrison, Ron Brookmeyer, Michael A Pfeffer, Thomas H Payne, Judith S Currier.

Inference about the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 can provide important insights into the speed of disease spread and the effects of mitigation policies. We develop a novel Bayesian approach to such inference based on a probabilistic compartmental model using data of daily confirmed COVID-19 cases. In particular, we consider a probabilistic extension of the classical susceptible-infectious-recovered model, which takes into account undocumented infections and allows the epidemiological parameters to vary over time. We estimate the disease transmission rate via a Gaussian process prior, which captures nonlinear changes over time without the need of specific parametric assumptions. We utilize a parallel-tempering Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm to efficiently sample from the highly correlated posterior space. Predictions for future observations are done by sampling from their posterior predictive distributions. Performance of the proposed approach is assessed using simulated datasets. Finally, our approach is applied to COVID-19 data from six states of the United States: Washington, New York, California, Florida, Texas, and Illinois.

Here, the model is based upon the well-known susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) model with the difference that a total population is not defined or kept constant per se and the number of susceptible individuals does not decline monotonically. To the contrary, as we show herein, it can be increased in surge periods! In particular, we investigate the time evolution of different populations and monitor diverse significant parameters for the spread of the disease in various communities, represented by China, South Korea, India, Australia, USA, Italy and the state of Texas in the USA. The SIR model can provide us with insights and predictions of the spread of the virus in communities that the recorded data alone cannot. Our work shows the importance of modelling the spread of COVID-19 by the SIR model that we propose here, as it can help to assess the impact of the disease by offering valuable predictions. Our analysis takes into account data from January to June, 2020, the period that contains the data before and during the implementation of strict and control measures. We propose predictions on various parameters related to the spread of COVID-19 and on the number of susceptible, infected and removed populations until September 2020. By comparing the recorded data with the data from our modelling approaches, we deduce that the spread of COVID-19 can be under control in all communities considered, if proper restrictions and strong policies are implemented to control the infection rates early from the spread of the disease. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","COVID-19; forecasting; infectious disease; pandemic; SIR model; virus spreading","Disease control; Forecasting; Viruses; Australia; Control measures; Infection rates; SIR model; South Korea; Suscep-tible-infected-removed models; Theoretical framework; Time evolutions; Population statistics","https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019, World Health organization, coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak; Wu, J.T., Leung, K., Leung, G.M., Nowcasting and forecasting the potential domestic and international spread of the 2019-ncov outbreak originating in wuhan, china: a modelling study (2020) The Lancet, 395 (10225), pp. 689-697; https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19, Novel coronavirus (COVID-19) cases, provided by JHU CSSE; Tang, B., Wang, X., Li, Q., Bragazzi, N.L., Tang, S., Xiao, Y., Wu, J., Estimation of the transmission risk of the 2019-ncov and its implication for public health interventions (2020) Journal of clinical medicine, 9 (2), p. 462; Kraemer, M.U., Yang, C.H., Gutierrez, B., Wu, C.H., Klein, B., Pigott, D.M., Brownstein, J.S., The effect of human mobility and control measures on the COVID-19 epidemic in china (2020) Science, 368 (6490), pp. 493-497; https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance, WHO, naming the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and the virus that causes it; Song, P., Wang, L., Zhou, Y., He, J., Zhu, B., Wang, F., Eisenberg, M., An epidemiological forecast model and software assessing interventions on COVID-19 epidemic in China (2020), p. 3. , medRxiv.

To contain its spread, a number of countries published control measures. However, it's not known when the epidemic will end in global and various countries. Predicting the trend of COVID-19 is an extremely important challenge. We integrate the most updated COVID-19 epidemiological data before June 16, 2020 into the Logistic model to fit the cap of epidemic trend, and then feed the cap value into FbProphet model, a machine learning based time series prediction model to derive the epidemic curve and predict the trend of the epidemic. Three significant points are summarized from our modeling results for global, Brazil, Russia, India, Peru and Indonesia. Under mathematical estimation, the global outbreak will peak in late October, with an estimated 14.12 million people infected cumulatively. © 2020","Coronavirus; COVID-19; Epidemic; FbProphet; Forecasting; Logistic; Modeling","Estimation; Forecasting; Machine learning; Control measures; Epidemic curve; Indonesia; Logistic models; Mathematical estimation; Model results; Significant points; Time series prediction; Epidemiology","Li, X., Zai, J., Zhao, Q., Nie, Q., Li, Y., Foley, B.T., Evolutionary history, potential intermediate animal host, and cross-species analyses of SARS-CoV-2 (2020) J Med Virol; Guan, W., Ni, Z., Hu, Y., Liang, W., Ou, C., He, J., Clinical characteristics of coronavirus disease 2019 in China (2020) N Engl J Med; Li, Q., Guan, X., Wu, P., Wang, X., Zhou, L., Tong, Y., Early transmission dynamics in Wuhan, China, of novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia (2020) N Engl J Med; Jacobsen, K.H., Will COVID-19 generate global preparedness?

In our experiment, the model that incorporates the highest degree of nonlinearity (Gaussian Kernel) had the best in-sample performance, but also yielded the worst out-of-sample predictions, a typical example of overfitting in a machine learning model. On the other hand, the linear Kernel function performed badly in-sample but generated the best out-of-sample forecasts.

Several epidemiological mathematical models of spread are increasing daily to forecast the predictions appropriately. In this study, the classical susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) modeling approach was employed to study the different parameters of this model for India. This approach was analyzed by considering different governmental lockdown measures in India. Some assumptions were considered to fit the model in the Python simulation for each lockdown scenario. The predicted parameters of the SIR model exhibited some improvement in each case of lockdown in India.

The main difficulty is the level of novelty imposed by these phenomena. Information from previous epidemics is only partially relevant. Further, the spread is local-dependent, reflecting a number of social, political, economic, and environmental dynamic factors. The present paper aims to provide a relatively simple way to model, forecast, and evaluate the time incidence of a pandemic. The proposed framework makes use of the non-central beta (NCB) probability density function. Specifically, a probabilistic optimisation algorithm searches for the best NCB model of the pandemic, according to the mean square error metric. The resulting model allows one to infer, among others, the general peak date, the ending date, and the total number of cases as well as to compare the level of difficult imposed by the pandemic among territories. Case studies involving COVID-19 incidence time series from countries around the world suggest the usefulness of the proposed framework in comparison with some of the main epidemic models from the literature (e.g. SIR, SIS, SEIR) and established time series formalisms (e.g. exponential smoothing - ETS, autoregressive integrated moving average - ARIMA). © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","COVID-19; Forecasting; Optimisation; Pandemic models; Time series","Autoregressive moving average model; Epidemiology; Forecasting; Mean square error; Probability density function; Auto-regressive integrated moving average; Case-studies; Coronaviruses; Environmental dynamics; Epidemic models; Exponential smoothing; Health professionals; Optimisations; Time series","Li, Q., Guan, X., Wu, P., Wang, X., Zhou, L., Tong, Y., Early transmission dynamics in Wuhan, China, of novel coronavirus–infected pneumonia (2020) N Top N Engl J Med; Anzai, A., Kobayashi, T., Linton, N.M., Kinoshita, R., Hayashi, K., Suzuki, A., Assessing the impact of reduced travel on exportation dynamics of novel coronavirus infection (COVID-19) (2020) J Clin Med, 9 (2), p. 601; https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019, Organization W.H.

Engineering College, Jodhpur, 342011, India","Ever since the outbreak of novel coronavirus in December 2019, lockdown has been identified as the only effective measure across the world to stop the community spread of this pandemic. India implemented a complete shutdown across the nation from March 25, 2020 as lockdown I and went on to extend it by giving timely partial relaxations in the form of lockdown II, III & IV. This paper statistically analyses the impact of relaxation during Lockdown III and IV on coronavirus disease (COVID) spread in India using the Group Method of Data Handling (GMDH) to forecast the number of active cases using time series analysis and hence the required medical infrastructure for the period of next six months. The Group Method of Data Handling is a novel self organized data mining technique with data driven adaptive learning capability which grasps the auto correlative relations between the samples and gives a high forecasting accuracy irrespective of the length and stochasticity of a time series. The GMDH model has been first validated and standardized by forecasting the number of active and confirmed cases during lockdown III-IV with an accuracy of 2.58% and 2.00% respectively.

As the epidemic season fluctuates from year to year, the availability of accurate forecasts of incidence can be decisive in attaining control of such diseases. Obtaining such forecasts from classical time series models has proven a difficult task. Here we propose and compare machine learning models incorporating feature selection,such as LASSO and Random Forest regression with LSTM a deep recurrent neural network, to forecast weekly dengue incidence in 790 cities in Brazil. We use multivariate time-series as predictors and also utilize time series from similar cities to capture the spatial component of disease transmission. The LSTM recurrent neural network model attained the highest performance in predicting future incidence on dengue in cities of different sizes. © 2020","Deep learning; Dengue; Epidemiology; LSTM; Time series forecasting","Article; atmospheric pressure; city; controlled study; dengue; environmental temperature; feature selection; forecasting; human; humidity; incidence; lasso regression; long short term memory network; machine learning; multivariate analysis; priority journal; random forest; regression analysis; Rio de Janeiro (state); time series analysis; virus transmission","Adams, B., Kapan, D.D., Man bites mosquito: understanding the contribution of human movement to vector-borne disease dynamics (2009) PLoS ONE, 4 (8), p. e6763; de Almeida Marques-Toledo, C., Degener, C.M., Vinhal, L., Coelho, G., Meira, W., Codeço, C.T., Teixeira, M.M., Dengue prediction by the web: tweets are a useful tool for estimating and forecasting dengue at country and city level (2017) PLoS Negl.

It is thus urgent to predict the development and spread of the epidemic. In this paper, we have developed a forecasting model of COVID-19 by using a deep learning method with rolling update mechanism based on the epidemical data provided by Johns Hopkins University. First, as traditional epidemical models use the accumulative confirmed cases for training, it can only predict a rising trend of the epidemic and cannot predict when the epidemic will decline or end, an improved model is built based on long short-term memory (LSTM) with daily confirmed cases training set. Second, considering the existing forecasting model based on LSTM can only predict the epidemic trend within the next 30 days accurately, the rolling update mechanism is embedded with LSTM for long-term projections. Third, by introducing Diffusion Index (DI), the effectiveness of preventive measures like social isolation and lockdown on the spread of COVID-19 is analyzed in our novel research. The trends of the epidemic in 150 days ahead are modeled for Russia, Peru and Iran, three countries on different continents. Under our estimation, the current epidemic in Peru is predicted to continue until November 2020. The number of positive cases per day in Iran is expected to fall below 1000 by mid-November, with a gradual downward trend expected after several smaller peaks from July to September, while there will still be more than 2000 increase by early December in Russia. Moreover, our study highlights the importance of preventive measures which have been taken by the government, which shows that the strict controlment can significantly reduce the spread of COVID-19. © 2020","Covid-19; Forecasting; LSTM; Modeling; Rolling update mechanism","Deep learning; Epidemiology; Forecasting; Learning systems; Diffusion indices; Forecasting modeling; Johns hopkins universities; Learning methods; Preventive measures; Social isolation; Time series prediction; Update mechanisms; Long short-term memory","Jacobsen, K.H., Will COVID-19 generate global preparedness (2020) Lancet, 395, pp. 1013-1014; Li, Q., Guan, X., Wu, P., Wang, X., Zhou, L., Tong, Y., Ren, R., Feng, Z., Early transmission dynamics in Wuhan, China, of novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia (2020) New Engl J Med, 382, pp. 1199-1207; Shao, N., Cheng, J., Chen, W., (2020), The reproductive number R0 of COVID-19 based on estimate of a statistical time delay dynamical system. medRxiv; Kraemer, M.U.G., Yang, C.-H., Gutierrez, B., Wu, C.-H., Klein, B., Pigott, D.M., Plessis, L.D., Scarpino, S.V., The effect of human mobility and control measures on the COVID-19 epidemic in China (2020) Science, 368, pp. 493-497; Ozaslan, M., Safdar, M., Kilic, I.H., Khailany, R.A., Practical measures to prevent COVID-19: a mini-review (2020) J Biol Sci, 20, pp. 100-102; Wang, P., Zheng, X., Li, J., Zhu, B., Prediction of epidemic trends in COVID-19 with logistic model and machine learning technics (2020) Chaos Solitons Fractals, 139; Zheng, N., Du, S., Wang, J., Zhang, H., Cui, W., Kang, Z., Yang, T., Xin, J., Predicting COVID-19 in China using hybrid AI model (2020) IEEE Trans Cybern, pp. 1-14; Contreras, J., Espinola, R., Nogales, F.J., Conejo, A.J., ARIMA models to predict next-day electricity prices (2002) IEEE Trans Power Syst, 18, pp. 1014-1020; Persio, L.D., Honchar, O., (2016), Artificial neural networks architectures for stock price prediction: Comparisons and applications; Zhang, Q., Lam, J.C.K., Li, V.O.K., (2020), Y.

In this perspective, it is possible to develop strategic planning in the public health system to avoid deaths as well as managing patients. In this paper, proposed forecast models comprising autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), support vector regression (SVR), long shot term memory (LSTM), bidirectional long short term memory (Bi-LSTM) are assessed for time series prediction of confirmed cases, deaths and recoveries in ten major countries affected due to COVID-19. The performance of models is measured by mean absolute error, root mean square error and r2_score indices. In the majority of cases, Bi-LSTM model outperforms in terms of endorsed indices. Models ranking from good performance to the lowest in entire scenarios is Bi-LSTM, LSTM, GRU, SVR and ARIMA. Bi-LSTM generates lowest MAE and RMSE values of 0.0070 and 0.0077, respectively, for deaths in China. The best r2_score value is 0.9997 for recovered cases in China. On the basis of demonstrated robustness and enhanced prediction accuracy, Bi-LSTM can be exploited for pandemic prediction for better planning and management. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Bi-LSTM; Corona virus; COVID-19; Deep learning models; epidemic prediction; GRU","Autoregressive moving average model; Deep learning; Forecasting; Learning to rank; Mean square error; Predictive analytics; Support vector regression; Auto-regressive integrated moving average; Mean absolute error; Prediction accuracy; Public health systems; Root mean square errors; Short term prediction; Support vector regression (SVR); Time series prediction; Long short-term memory","Organization, W.H., Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) situation report–51 (2020), https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200606-covid-19-sitrep-138.pdf?sfvrsn=c8abfb17_4, World Health Organization Geneva, Switzerland 2020; Bai, Y., Presumed asymptomatic carrier transmission of COVID-19 (2020) JAMA, 323 (14), pp. 1406-1407; Kermack, W.O., McKendrick, A.G., A contribution to the mathematical theory of epidemics (1927) Proceedings of the royal society of London.

The A-SIR model, i.e. a SIR (Susceptible–Infected–Removed) model with a compartment for infected individuals with no symptoms or few symptoms was proposed by Gaeta (2020). In this paper we investigate a slightly generalized version of the same model and propose a scheme for fitting the parameters of the model to real data using the time series only of the deceased individuals. The scheme is applied to the concrete cases of Lombardy, Italy and São Paulo state, Brazil, showing different aspects of the epidemic. In both cases we see strong evidence that the adoption of social distancing measures contributed to a slower increase in the number of deceased individuals when compared to the baseline of no reduction in the infection rate. Both for Lombardy and São Paulo we show that we may have good fits to the data up to the present, but with very large differences in the future behavior. The reasons behind such disparate outcomes are the uncertainty on the value of a key parameter, the probability that an infected individual is fully symptomatic, and on the intensity of the social distancing measures adopted. This conclusion enforces the necessity of trying to determine the real number of infected individuals in a population, symptomatic or asymptomatic. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","COVID-19; Epidemics; Mathematical modeling; SIR-type models","Infection rates; NO reduction; Real number; SIR model; Physics","Li, R., Substantial undocumented infection facilitates the rapid dissemination of novel coronavirus (SARS-cov2) (2020) Science; Gaeta, G., A simple SIR model with a large set of asymptomatic infectives (2020) Math.
