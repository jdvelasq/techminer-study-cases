The concept treated in this paper are mobile parcel lockers that are able to change their locations during the day, either autonomously or moved by a human driver. By relocating lockers their reach towards addressees also varying their whereabouts over the day can be increased. This paper optimizes the changing locations of lockers, such that customers are at some time during the planning horizon within a predefined range of their designated locker. Our aim is to minimize the locker fleet when satisfying all customers. We formulate the resulting mobile locker location problem and provide suited exact solution procedures. To asses the potential whether mobile lockers are a promising last-mile concept, worth the investment required to develop it to a market-ready solution, we benchmark the necessary fleet size of mobile lockers with the required number of their stationary counterparts. Our results show that considerable reductions are possible.

However, most decision support models in location studies of consolidation facilities are limited to numerical computation or multi-criteria analysis while ignoring spatial factors in location selection. This study aims to characterise suitable locations for an inner-city consolidation facility based on spatial aspects, operational requirements, and societal concerns. Accordingly, this study presents an integrated spatial multi-criteria location framework to identify and rank optimal sites for a proposed freight consolidation facility in an inner-city area using 11 decision criteria identified from key stakeholders. Real geographic data from Inner Melbourne, Australia, are used to identify 20 candidate sites which are then evaluated and ranked using the TOPSIS method. The suitability analysis confirms that the most suitable locations are in zones with affordable industrial land with excellent accessibility to major roads and goods receivers. Sensitivity analysis indicates that assigning more significance to the operational requirements and decreasing the priority weight for proximity to residential areas tip favourability towards areas with low real estate costs and more industrially-zoned parts. The multi-criteria spatial modelling allows decision-makers and transport researchers to apply value-decisions at the onset of the process, and it also allows for improved understanding and visualisation of the results and of the significance of the chosen criteria in the evaluation process.

Based on a survey that was conducted among carriers, traffic wardens, and retailers, a decision hierarchy structure, consisting of the relevant criteria evaluated by various statistical techniques, will be used for sustainable implementation of UDCs. The methodology uses a database collected in the historical center of Ouro Preto, a Brazilian city which contains common characteristics of other Latin American and some European cities that are included in theWorld Heritage List. This structure is unique, as it is based on a survey among the main stakeholders, and can be applied by logistics operators and local authorities for implementing UDCs to address urban distribution issues, especially in historical cities. However, without loss of generality, the proposed methodology can be adopted for different cities using the appropriate criteria according to the characteristics of the cities.

This problem arises in sustainable applications for e-commerce and city distribution. In the first echelon, trucks depart from a single depot and transport goods to two types of locations. At covering locations, such as parcel lockers, customers can pick up goods themselves. At satellite locations, goods are transferred to zero-emission vehicles (such as cargo bikes) that deliver to customers. If desired, customers can indicate their choice for delivery. The 2E-VRP-CO aims at finding cost-minimizing solutions by selecting locations and routes to serve all customers. We present a compact mixed integer programming formulation and an efficient and tailored adaptive large neighborhood search heuristic that provides high-quality, and often optimal, solutions to the 2E-VRP-CO. The 2E-VRP-CO has as special cases the two-echelon vehicle routing problem, and the simultaneous facility location and vehicle routing problem without duration constraints. On these special cases, for which our heuristic predominantly solves the established benchmark instances either to optimality or to the best-known solution, our heuristic finds three new best-known solutions. Moreover, we introduce a new set of benchmark instances for the 2E-VRP-CO and provide managerial insights when distribution via both satellite and covering locations is most beneficial. Our results indicate that customers in the same area are best-served either via cargo-bikes or parcel lockers (i.e., not both), and that the use of parcel lockers has a great potential to reduce driving distance.

The methodology was a multiple case study approach, comparing cases in Sweden and Scotland, two countries that are more/less advanced in their approach to UFT policy. The key finding reveals that while UFT policies such as time window restrictions can support successful UCCs, they cannot be considered in isolation from the collaborative UFT policy setting established by the local authority. A successful development also requires a commitment to financially support the UCC over at least the medium term, allowing time for the system to mature and collaborative service offerings to be developed. The findings of this study can be used by local authorities to establish a supportive UFT policy setting, as well as specifically designing policy packages in conjunction with UCC business models.

In this paper, we propose a methodology for evaluating the performance of a parcel distribution network in city logistics. This methodology encompasses the main entities of a two-tier distribution system made up of carriers, huge shopping centers (multi-tenant buildings) and intermediate depots (urban consolidation centers), as well as the parcel flows between them. This methodology aims to optimize the transport flows (distance traveled) of a given distribution network while also quantifying the impact in terms of sustainable development by measuring gas emissions. Two different states of the network with different connectivity degrees are evaluated and compared: the current state of the network as well as its future state. The transport network modeling is based on a network flow, which is expressed in linear programming and implemented with an optimization solver. The validation of this methodology is based on the parcel distribution of the Multi-tenant Buildings of the city of Tokyo. The findings are that the network with greater connectivity between the entities brings significant traveled distance reduction as well as a reduction of emissions of CO2. Another finding is that the grouping of the parcels (i.e., pooling) brings a reduction of the distance traveled compared to the transport organization without grouping and contributes to a reduction in the number of trucks.

In China, there is a huge B2 e-commerce business here, and there is a relatively large population density in first-tier cities, causing the last mile of Chinese e-commerce delivery to face tremendous pressure every day. However, through analysis of survey data, in a certain tier city in China, each parcel was stored in a parcel locker for more than 10 hours, which caused a very low turnover rate of the lockers. In order to explore the influencing factors that affect the turnover rate of parcel lockers, this article started with obtaining real-time data of parcel lockers, and then analyzed the characteristics of the data to find the effect function of the storage time for the cargo in the parcel lockers. During the empirical analysis, we found that users showed significantly different characteristics, that is, they were divided into two types of users. Then, this article mines the characteristics of the two types of users and names them as the First-class users, Second-class users. On this basis, this article finds that the length of parcel storage is related to user classification. In addition, this article conducted a series of rigorous empirical research and analysis in order to explore the impact of other factors on the storage time of the package, and finally found that under the same type of user, there is a significant correlation between the length of storage time and the pickup time. Therefore, this paper established a dumb linear regression model to explore the law of parcel staying time in parcel locker, which the user type was used as a dummy variable, and the pickup time was used as another independent variable. The model passed the significance test.Therefore, this article further analyzes the influencing factors of the utilization efficiency of lockers.

The specificity of such logistics and the multiple limitations led to particular solutions. However, they all share one common feature-the flow consolidation in different variants. This study considers the flow consolidation at the boundary of urban congested areas, through horizontal collaboration between logistic platforms. This way, the urban distribution centers (UDCs) receive all the goods according to the orders addressed to each producer (or group in case of ""on-going consolidations""). Deliveries are addressed to a single logistic platform. Thus, the flow consolidation is achieved. Each logistic platform receives part of the consumer goods intended for commercialization, but through collaboration between them (freight exchanges), all the warehouses of the producers have all the ordered goods. Dedicated management of logistics platforms and warehouses within each UDC ensures the confidentiality of distributor data. Three scenarios are presented concerning the same pattern of flow addressed to each UDC. These scenarios differ by the accessibility of the logistics platforms and by the connection between them (due to infrastructure development). The methodology of choosing the variants for composing the flow sent from each logistics platform considered the minimization of transfer times to UDC warehouses. Synthetic indicators allow for comparison between the analyzed scenarios.

The amount of successful UCCs in the long run were, and are, very scarce, though. Little is published on the practical issues and experiences of running a UCC and offering UCC-services. In the Netherlands, Binnenstadservice (BSS) has run UCCs and UCC services for over a decade now. This contribution discusses development and the experiences of running a UCC in practice in the form of seven lessons, including the evolvement of the business model and organisation model, as well as the development from offering 'only' the cross-dock of physical flows, to that of the full triple cross-dock, including financial and information flows. Next, UCCs can be the answer to future challenges, such as zero emission city logistics and fit perfectly into the Physical Internet vision.

However, such operations cause several problems such as traffic congestion and environmental deterioration. Urban Consolidation Centers (UCC) are logistic platforms aiming to rationalize goods distribution by minimizing the above impacts, satisfying at the same time stakeholders’ interests, such as public authorities, supply chain stakeholders (retailers, carriers and suppliers), consumers and civilians. This paper proposes establishment of a UCC in the vicinity of the city of Volos, where trucks unload their cargo and cross-docking activities take place before goods are directed to the urban area for final distribution. Urban distribution is undertaken by green vehicles, which are assumed to replace conventional delivery trucks, in order to reduce operational costs and impacts in the city from urban distribution movements. As Volos is a medium sized city, delivery of goods by cargo bikes and green vehicles is foreseen. Traffic and system performance impacts that result from the operation of the new system are compared with the case before the UCC establishment. All impacts are combined in a sole index (Logistics Sustainability Index) which comprises the comparison of the two cases.

However, since mathematical modeling of multiple site selection often turns out to be NP-hard problem structure, it is not always possible to obtain an optimal solution by the solvers. For this reason, various meta-heuristic approaches have emerged to solve these complex models. In this context, the aim of this study is to propose an integrated methodology which seeks an optimum result efficiently regarding a logistics center location selection problem. Thus, the optimal clustering of logistics mobility in a metropolitan area was carried out with GIS and a meta-heuristic approach. GIS produced the spatial information needed by p-median model, then the meta-heuristic approach determined the optimal result that considers the logistics costs. BPSO algorithm has employed as the meta-heuristic and it is observed that the algorithm can reach the optimum results within superior times for the problem sizes tested where binary integer programming verified the optimums and the algorithm continued to reach improved solutions where the exact algorithms failed for larger instances. The integrated solution methodology is applied to a large metropolitan region and it is found that it can be used properly by the urban city planners and supply chain managers to analyze critical nodes of transportation networks of megacities.

New and innovative ways of data collection provide new possibilities to analyze these issues. In this paper we present MASS-GT, a new multi-agent simulation system for urban goods transport. The empirical basis is provided by an exceptionally large dataset of truck trip travel diaries for The Netherlands that was collected from transportation management systems using an automated data collection interface. The dataset is very dense and includes information on vehicles, routes, and shipments carried. The strategic part of the model simulates the formation of individual shipments based on logistic processes at a strategic level, such as sourcing, distribution channel choice and shipment size choice. At tactical level disaggregate choices are simulated for tour formation, vehicle type- and time of day choice, based on observed distributions. The multi-agent approach allows to implement heterogeneous preferences and thus differentiated responses to new policies. We present an application of the model to study the impacts of urban consolidation centers (UCC) and zero emission zones. The freight transportation volumes transported to these UCC and their impact on logistic indicators are analyzed. Simulation results show that vehicle kilometers travelled within the wider region increase with the introduction of UCC, and at the same time the efficiency of deliveries increases as well. Thus the model allows to study trade-offs between regional and local systems that emerge from different behavioural responses to policies.

Determining the location of the logistics center is an important decision regarding cost and benefit analysis. A three-stage methodology has been applied for presenting a framework for logistics center location selection in the context of Kayseri’s logistics development plan. The first stage includes the determination of criteria through literature review and interviews with experts. The second stage includes the weighting of determined criteria using linear BWM (best–worst method). The third stage includes the ranking of locations using the evaluation based on distance from average solution (EDAS) method with different distance measures. Our proposed methodology BWM–EDAS and also EDAS with different distance measures, which are applied for the first time in the literature, provides helpful findings to rank the logistics center locations. Lastly, sensitivity analysis is conducted to validate the robustness.

A system of parcel lockers operated by a non-competing company, open to any logistic service provider can contribute to make goods distribution and the last mile more sustainable. The research project ""Skalierbares, offenes Waren-Austausch-System"" (SoWAS) investigates the development of such a system and will evaluate generated changes in customer's mobility behaviour by an online panel survey in a living lab area. This paper presents the approach of an online panel survey and its first application on two person groups. The earliest results give first interesting and precise insights into customer's mobility behaviour concerning received and dispatched/returned parcels-a field with poor available data. Based on the collected data we estimated a reduction potential of 27% for emissions and vehicle kilometres per picked-up/dropped off parcel. Furthermore, a modal shift of 12% from car to environmental friendly transport modes is possible due to the introduction of a parcel locker system.

To stay ahead of the competitors innovation is necessary. Currently, parcels are being delivered with large delivery vans which will usually deliver single parcels to doorsteps of their customers. This so called 'last mile delivery' is the most expensive logistics activity. In the literature it is proposed that parcel lockers have high potential to save cost. In our paper a literature review on parcel lockers, 3 methods for analysis are described and the results of a case study are provided.

Moreover, increased limitations on urban freight transport, including access constraints, limited kerbside and private parking spaces for loading/unloading, and the often prohibitive costs of installing logistics infrastructures in city centres, have further constrained urban freight transport. To address these issues, several city logistics solutions have been proposed, such as two-tier distribution systems and distribution systems based on mobile depots. In this paper, we focus on two-tier urban freight distribution systems based on mobile depots, where little or no physical infrastructure is considered and where storage is not permitted at transfer locations. In these types of systems, coordination and synchronisation between vehicles are essential, and the main objective is to have vehicles at the transfer locations in a need-to-be basis as a way of minimising the negative externalities. We review and analyse 13 cases found in the scientific literature, trial reports and online resources, and propose a classification of these systems based on the level of mobility and accessibility of transportation modes operating at the first-tier. Furthermore, we characterise the main components and operational features of the different systems, including the existence of multi-trips, the types of transport modes used at both tiers, transported loads and the organisation of the transfer sites (satellites). This work aims to contribute for a clearer characterisation of two-tier urban distribution systems based on mobile depots, to later support the development of the most adequate mathematical models and solution methods to be applied to each variant of this type of systems.

Among different interactions, retail delivery services, like home delivery or door-to-door delivery, have gained importance in recent years, being now a competitive advantage. However, this interaction is expensive because of the distances that must be traveled, and it could incur in low service levels due to the large number of orders that might not be covered completely. The use of mobile warehouses constitutes a good approach to solve retail delivery logistics problems. Mobile warehouses are vehicles that drive around the city, perform the delivery to the final customer and manage the administrative tasks such as billing and collecting money. This delivery strategy requires to know the number of products that the vehicle should carry in order to satisfy the demand without returning to the distribution center. This study presents a methodology for demand forecasting and inventory management in a mobile warehouse. Different forecasting methods were used, but artificial neural networks showed the best performance to forecast demand using mobile warehouses. Once the demand forecast is determined, a linear programing optimization model is proposed for inventory management with the aim to reduce the total cost of stock out occurrences in terms of traveling distance to the distribution center, time expended, and lost cost sale. A case study from an Ecuadorian company in Quito is presented, in which the number of products that the vehicle should carry is determined minimizing the stock out occurrences.

The rising number of initiatives to establish and operate urban consolidation centers and their low success rates signal the need for better mechanisms to manage cooperation in this context. We introduce and study cooperative situations comprising a set of carriers with time sensitive deliveries who can consolidate their cargo to obtain savings. We introduce the class of Dispatch Consolidation (DC) games and search for ways to fairly allocate the obtained savings among the participating carriers. When delivery capacities are not restrictive, i.e. when waiting costs trigger truck dispatches, we show that stable allocations in the core always exist and can, in their entirety, be found by solving a compact linear program. With restrictive capacities, however, the core of a DC game may become empty. We introduce the notion of component-wise core for DC games to preserve stability first and foremost among the carriers whose deliveries are dispatched together in the chosen optimal solutions. The novelty of our approach is to link the stability requirements of an allocation rule with the structure of selected solutions for the underlying optimization problems. We characterize the component-wise cores of DC games, prove their non-emptiness, and suggest proportionally calculated allocations therein. Finally, we discuss a refinement of component-wise core allocations that minimizes envy among the carriers who are dispatched separately.

In the traditional delivery model, each recipient specifies a single location at which they wish to receive the parcel; however, when SPs are used, many recipients may have no strong preference among several locations, e.g., near the recipient’s home address, near the recipient’s office, or in the recipient’s favorite shopping mall. If some recipients are flexible and willing to provide the sender with more than one delivery location, it is possible to perform the delivery task at lower cost and within a shorter amount of time. Our solution methods are based on the concepts of the savings heuristic, the petal method and tabu search with a large neighborhood. An extensive numerical study is conducted to evaluate our solution methods and demonstrate the benefits of our model compared to the traditional nonflexible one. We also present a simulation study to demonstrate that our model can be adapted to a stochastic and dynamic environment.

The use of an urban distribution centre (UDC) is a solution to minimise these impacts. This paper compares the operational, economic, social, cultural, and environmental aspects that influence the implementation of a UDC in a Brazilian historical city, considering the viewpoints of the agents: residents, retailers and carriers. Having a more complete picture of these aspects by the agents, this paper also sheds light on corporate social responsibility (CSR) in urban freight transport (UFT). A survey was developed with each agent. Factor analysis is used to find the factors for implementation of a UDC and the Structural Equivalence by Orthogonal Procrustes Rotation is used to compare the factors. The findings reveal different points of view for these agents. Residents attached greater importance to factors related to habitability and sustainability in the city. Retailers focused on economic environmental issues, while carriers emphasised operational and environmental aspects.

Economic efficiency and environment friendliness criteria were used to evaluate the sustainability of UCC. The results proved that the implementation of UCC as a sustainable city logistics scheme is efficient in reducing 8% of the total delivery cost for freight carrier and reducing 36% of the total emissions released to the environment. It is also showed that the use of learning agents is essential to demonstrate the successful implementation of the UCC, as it is only in the learning-based simulation, UCC operator could get a profit. Our simulation analysis also confirmed that compared to widely used reinforced learning algorithms (Q-learning), MAS-ADP brought increased accuracy to the evaluations' outcomes of UCC.

The high costs often prevent attracting a sufficient number of UCC users. In this paper, we study sustainable business models and the supporting role of administrative policies. We perform an agent-based simulation applied to the city of Copenhagen and collect data from a variety of sources to model the agents. Both the data and case setup are validated by means of expert interviews. We test 1,458 schemes that combine several administrative measures and cost settings. Most schemes yield significant environmental benefits; many of them reduce the truck kilometers driven by about 65% and emissions by about 70%. The key challenge is to identify schemes that are also financially sustainable. We show the importance of committing carriers to the UCC as soon as possible, as carriers potentially generate the bulk of the revenue. Subsequent revenues may be generated by offering value-adding services to receivers. Based on the numerical experiments, we pose various propositions that aid in providing favorable conditions for a UCC, improving its chances of long-term success.

The paper’s objective, using a diffusion of innovations (DOI) theory is to understand antecedent factors for UCC adoption (or not). Data collection consisted of observation of the Bristol-Bath UCC operation and semi-structured interviews with stakeholders. Findings supported the proposition that a UCC represents an IOI and increases stakeholder performance in both urban and operational contexts. Contributions include combining aspects of IOI and DOI theory to broaden understanding of stakeholder expectations of adoption factors and determining seven factors that play a key role for stakeholders to adopt this form of innovation and in understanding IOI dropouts: relative advantage, compatibility, complexity, adoption risk, trialability, partner trust, and partner power/government influence.

This paper applies the evolutionary game theory to study the governmental intervention mechanism for the layout of urban distribution centers, establishes a static evolutionary game model between the government and distribution enterprises with considering consumers' green preferences, and analyzes the interaction mechanism between the government and distribution enterprises. Moreover, dynamic tax evolutionary game model is established to explore the direction of system evolution under the dynamic scenario. In the simulation, we compare the merits and demerits of the two scenarios, and make a sensitivity of taxation and consumers' green preferences. The research results show that the evolutionary game system can't reach the asymptotic stable state under the static mechanism, but can reach the asymptotic stable state under the dynamic taxation mechanism, and the level of taxation and consumers' green preference has a significant impact on the decision-making of distribution enterprise.

The methodology integrates indications deriving from public policies (objectives and constraints) and efficiency needs of carriers and retailers. For this reason, two planning levels are integrated into the methodology: an outer level in which a set of feasible UDC locations is defined; an inner level in which, for each location, the carrier behaviour in delivering freight to a set of retailers, characterized by variable restocking demand, is simulated (by means of a vehicle routing problem). The aim of the paper is to support the planning of city logistics measures by means of quantitative evaluations; that could be carried out by public authority to verify sustainability of logistic operations. A laboratory test is implemented in the town of Reggio Calabria (Southern Italy) to assess the effects of a combination of two city logistics measures: a nodal physical measure, such as an UDC, and an equipment measure, specifically Fully Electric Vehicles (FEVs).

The standardized construction development of urban distribution centers will help to achieve efficient use of urban resources. This paper studies the classification and grading of urban distribution centers. Based on the function, urban distribution centers can be divided into three types: supply-oriented, sales-oriented and comprehensive. For the classification of urban distribution centers, the Delphi Method is used to select the three indicators of floor area, annual throughput and registered capital as the basis for the grading of urban distribution centers. Then, from the perspective of scale economy, the engineering method is used to measure the reasonable scale of urban distribution centers. Finally, the reasonable scale is divided into five grades by using the Equal Difference Method, i.e. urban distribution centers are divided into five grades.

To decrease the negative impact of these issues, different methods have been traditionally implemented. On the one hand, the location of urban consolidation Centers (UCCs) near a city can be used to consolidate freight delivery services. Therefore, the number of trucks moving in urban areas can be reduced. On the other hand, Horizontal Cooperation can also help to reduce environmental impact while increasing service level. This paper combines both strategies, that is, we deal with the location of UCCs and, simultaneously, we analyze different scenarios where the players of different supply chain processes exhibit various levels of cooperation. Thus, different levels of cooperations regarding routing and UCCs-location decisions are considered in the following scenarios: (a) non-cooperative case, in which all decisions are decentralized (i.e., each enterprise solves its own vehicle routing problem); (b) low-cooperative case, where depot capacities are shared but the customers are still being served by each company's fleet of vehicles; (c) semi-cooperative case, based on centralized route planning decisions (i.e. facilities and fleets are shared among participating enterprises); and (d) fully cooperative scenario, where the routing plans and facility-location decisions are taken by consensus amongst all the participants. In order to estimate the benefits of both strategies, we propose a flexible metaheuristic algorithm to deal with the combined location and routing problem under the different cooperative scenarios. Our results show impressive benefits of the proposed approach.

This study presents a decision making system that sequentially integrates the processes of finding potential locations, determining the number of locations, and selecting the optimal locations for effective installation of unmanned parcel lockers. First of all, the location requirements including the neighborhood, accessibility, and public facilities in the area are defined. Then, the number of locations and the optimal location are determined using the location set-covering model and the p-median model, respectively. The suitability and effectiveness of the decision making system are verified through an application to a residential complex located in Incheon Metropolitan City in Korea. This study provides guidelines and references for the effective implementation of distributing unmanned parcel lockers and contributes to prevention of violent crimes by impersonating a delivery person and the economic benefit from increased users of the parcel delivery service.

A widely studied measure to reduce these negative effects are Urban Consolidation Centers (UCCs), which aim to bundle freight flows to reduce the number of urban freight transports. However, many projects showed that the additional costs of UCCs often made it unattractive for carriers to participate in such schemes. This paper presents an agent-based simulation to assess the impact of urban access regulations on the cost-attractiveness of UCCs for carriers. A case study inspired by the Frankfurt Rhine-Main area is presented to compare deliveries of a group of carriers with and without a Urban Consolidation Center under various urban access scenarios. The simulation shows that regulations increase the cost-attractiveness of UCCs for carriers to varying degrees while increasing the overall traffic volume.

Past attempts reveal however that the cases of success are scarce. This manuscript describes the results of a research aimed at evaluating the perspectives of the urban logistics agents regarding the implementation of a UDC in Lisbon Historic Downtown. The research method was based on a literature review, followed by a set of 24 semistructured interviews to both public and private agents. The results reveal an agreement on the addedvalue of a UDC. The investigation evidenced, however, divergences between agents on the management model, and on the most relevant requirements and conditions to the success of the UDC. The manuscript concludes with recommendations for the mitigation of the divergences.

Thus, this paper purposes a model to support the formulation of public policies focused on urban logistics, with emphasis on Urban Distribution Centers (UDCs). The method used is mathematical simulation based on System Dynamics and incorporates elements of inventory management and operations management. This paper presents the model and the proposed procedure for its application in two hypothetical cities, and compares the adoption of UDCs with other policies. The results, measured by total logistics costs and greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions indicate that the restrictions tend to negatively impact both indicators. On the other hand, UDCs are robust solutions that can reduce both costs and emissions and outperform other policies in the case of cities that have reached critical congestion levels. The replicability of the model is discussed.

Its impact is very high in terms of traffic, local air pollutions, noise, greenhouse gas emissions, etc. due to the numerous presence of goods vehicles often characterized by a low level of load saturation. Furthermore the final part of the supply chain is the least efficient and the more expensive of the entire logistics chain. Logistics distribution in urban areas needs to be optimized to be sustainable. The Urban Consolidation Centres (UCCs) are considered as solutions to solve urban logistics problems: increase in load factor and in service levels, and the reduction of congestion and emissions are the main advantages that these logistics infrastructure entail. To evaluate sustainability of this part of supply chain specific information are necessary: routes, points of delivery, traffic conditions, number of vehicles, volumes of goods. An analysis based on data from limit traffic zone (LTZ) cameras and on manual data collection allows an initial evaluation on the introduction in the supply chain of UCC. In particular the aim of the paper is to present a preliminary methodology to detect index figures (IF) for the UCCs sizing. Starting from data on vehicles, the goal is to extrapolate IF to compare with other existing realities. The analysis is conducted in a medium Italian city.

The center receives orders according to a stochastic arrival process and dispatches them in batches for the last-mile distribution. The operator of the center aims to find the cost-minimizing consolidation policy, depending on the orders at hand, preannounced orders, and stochastic arrivals. We present this problem as a variant of the delivery dispatching problem that includes dispatch windows and define a corresponding Markov decision model. Larger instances of the problem suffer from intractably large state-, outcome-, and action spaces. We propose an approximate dynamic programming (ADP) algorithm that can handle such instances, using a linear value function approximation to estimate the downstream costs. To design the value function approximation, we construct various sets of basis functions, numerically evaluate their suitability, and discuss the properties of good basis functions for the dispatching problem. Numerical experiments on toy-sized instances show that the best set of basis functions approximates the optimal values with an error of less than 3%. To cope with large action spaces, we formulate an integer linear program to be used within our ADP algorithm. We evaluate the performance of ADP policies against four benchmark policies: two heuristic policies, a direct cost minimization policy, and a post-decision rollout policy. We test the performance of ADP on a variety of networks. ADP consistently outperforms the benchmark policies, performing particularly well when there is sufficient flexibility in dispatch times.

There is, however, limited knowledge as to the actual performance of UCCs, and what roles and perspectives the involved actors have in the performance measurement. The overall aim of this paper is to investigate the roles and perspectives of involved actors when estimating and evaluating the performance of UCCs. The article is based on a study of one case that evaluates the performance of a UCC involving several actors. Interviews were triangulated with documents from the case. The results showed that actors have different roles in performance measurements and even if they share a mutual interest in conducting the measurements, they did not share opinions regarding factors such as system limits or performance indicators. The study provides a deeper understanding of the importance of inter-organizational interaction when conducting performance measurements. The study provides additional insights into the roles of the actors and their perspectives in logistics performance measurement that targets energy usage and environmental impact. These aspects are seldom addressed in less complex estimations or mathematical modelling estimations.

A plausible solution to reduce the impacts of the flow of goods in historical cities is to investigate different deliveries systems to reduce the externalities of this activity. This paper presents the results of a survey that identified the factors involved in the implementation of an Urban Distribution Centre (UDC) in Sabara (Brazil), considering modes non-motorized to perform the delivery in historic centres. For this, we identified the perception of retailers concerning historical and technical attributes. We analysed the data using descriptive statistics. The results indicate that lack of attractiveness of UDC, considering the point of view of retailers located in historic city centre. However, we identify the need to explore solutions for urban delivery in Brazilian historical cities to preserve historic heritage.

City logistics models can be effectively helpful for solving the complicated problems of this city. In the present study, a queuing theory-based bi-objective mathematical model is presented, which aims to optimize the environmental and economic costs in city logistics operations. It also tries to reduce the response time in the network. The first objective is associated with all beneficiaries and the second one is applicable for perishable and necessary goods. The proposed model makes decisions on urban distribution centers location problem. Subsequently, as a case study, the fruit and vegetable distribution network of Tehran city is investigated and redesigned via the proposed modelling. The results of the implementation of the model through traditional and augmented ε-constraint methods indicate the efficiency of the proposed model in redesigning the given network.

Due to the increasing number of residents in cities and increasing demand for e-commerce, increased the number of supply vehicles in cities, as well as pollution, congestions and car accidents. The most common solution for effective last mile delivery like vehicles using alternative fuels or electric vehicles for supplying the cities isn’t enough anymore. There is a need to focus on the total number of vehicles in cities and on sufficient use of loading space of those vehicles. An urban consolidation centre (UCC) could be a possible solution to economic, social and environmental problems in cities. This article focuses on possible using a UCC in the Czech Republic cities up to 100,000 residents. The article also provides an evaluation of the essential criteria for sustainability of UCC for the future.

For the last two decades, the concept of urban consolidation centres (UCCs) has been implemented in different cities. UCCs that were started for special subsectors (e.g. construction material handling) are relatively successful; however, general purpose UCCs are not performing well at all. Most UCCs are financially dependent on government support. The UCC concept can be successfully implemented by developing a consistent subsidy or tax scheme aiming to internalize the negative external effects of conventional urban goods distribution. In this paper, we describe and test such policy - a delivery cap and price (DCAP) scenario, combined with a subsidy for a UCC alternative – to reduce carbon emissions for urban goods delivery. The scenario introduces a cap on goods deliveries made to shopkeepers by conventional vehicles, using so-called carbon credit points (CCPs). We demonstrate this policy with a stylized implementation of a city logistics agent based model for the inner city of Rotterdam. The results indicate that this financial scheme could positively influences the use of UCC, ensures its financial viability and significantly reduce the external effects of urban freight transport.

However, implementing them poses a challenge because they incur high costs, coordinating different agents and multiple criteria. In historical cities, a UDC is an alternative to efficient urban freight transport (UFT) in terms of sustainability and preservation of historical heritage. This study analyses the operational, economic, social, cultural, and environmental criteria that influence the implementation of a UDC in historical cities, considering the different perspectives of four agents: residents, traffic wardens, retailers and carriers. We conducted semi-structured interviews with traffic wardens and retailers, and a survey was developed with all the agents. Univariate and multivariate statistical analyses were applied to find the relevant criteria for implementing a UDC according to the agents. Considering the viewpoint of all agents, the vehicle size was the most relevant common criteria when setting up a UDC to supply retailers in the historical city centre of Ouro Preto. Residents and traffic wardens had very similar points of view and agreed with the negative effects of UFT (air pollution level, visual intrusion level, insecurity, and congestion), while most retailers and carriers disagreed with these impacts.

Selecting the locations of urban distribution centers correctly, which have an essential role in distribution networks, will satisfy determining the number of vehicles, minimizing the traffic congestion by determining the routes of vehicles correctly and thus decreasing the environmental effects like noise and emission. In this study, location selection problem for fresh fruits and vegetables market hall (F&VMH) which is an important urban distribution center type that fulfills the food requirements of city residents is examined. The interval-valued trapezoidal fuzzy grey relational analysis (GRA) method is used to solve this problem because, it is suitable to deal with poor, incomplete, and uncertain information. When the results are analyzed, it is seen that F&VMHs have to be located in the district which is closer to producers and which has the lower construction and land costs.

The redelivery problem has also become serious due to the absence of receivers and the courier must deliver again at a later time. The increase in the number of redeliveries causes social losses such as extra workload of delivery, carbon dioxide emissions and so on. To improve this problem, Japanese government recommends the utilization of the parcel locker which is expected to reduce the number of redeliveries. While some empirical researches reveal the effectiveness of the parcel locker, quantitative evaluation using stochastic models has not been carried out yet. In this paper, we model the PDS including the parcel locker service as a queueing model and analyze it using a Quasi-Birth-and-Death (QBD) process. Furthermore, we derive the stability condition which must be satisfied to ensure the proper service and we derive some performance measures such as blocking probability, the mean number of parcels in queues. Our numerical experiments show the influence of the collaborative behavior of users on the efficiency of the system.

In addition, security issues for people who live in small townhouses and detached houses without security systems and guards have received increasing attention from the government and society. Thus, the introduction of a new alternative for home delivery services, unmanned parcel lockers, is urgent for residents living in these areas. This paper examines and compares potential socio-economic impacts in terms of costs and benefits when such lockers are installed at selected locations in residential areas. The results show that this policy is worthy of adoption, with several undeniable benefits to local communities. In addition, sensitivity analyses estimate the economic performance of this project at different social discount rates, and they check the sensitivity of economic performance based on variations in the variables. The value of travel time savings was identified as a critical and dominating factor directly affecting economic performance.

However, given the lack of scale effect, last mile delivery is inefficient, expensive, and produces a considerable amount of carbon emissions, which has become an obstacle to the development of a sustainable economy. This work proposes a traveling salesman problem with carbon emission reduction in last mile delivery. The proposed problem aims to reduce the total costs and carbon emissions of last mile delivery by deciding on the allocation of parcel lockers while scheduling delivery routes. In addition, we take the customer self-collection intention into consideration and translate it into self-collection costs, which are included in the objective. An iterated local search (ILS) algorithm is proposed, and four new local search operators are designed to improve customer allocation. The proposed method is tested on a set of scattered and clustered instances, including a real-world instance. The computational results show the superiority and competitiveness of the proposed algorithm.

Freight consolidation policies offer a sustainable solution to address these problems. The freight vehicles used in the consolidated deliveries could play a significant role in the sustainability and success of these policies. This paper applies a multi-stakeholder decision support approach to evaluate the suitability and potential of various delivery fleet configurations in addressing the perspectives and requirements of all stakeholders involved in last mile delivery to perform the consolidated delivery in the inner-city area. The Multi-Actor Multi-Criteria Analysis (MAMCA) framework was utilised to assess and rank various delivery configurations involving a combination of eco-friendly delivery vans, trucks and cargobikes based on the objectives of the stakeholders. The weight allocation of the criteria was determined through the Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (F-AHP) method using responses collected from key actors representing all stakeholder groups in Melbourne, Australia. The multi-stakeholder analysis, which was performed using the Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment Evaluation (PROMETHEE) method, suggested that the consolidated delivery should be performed using a combination of eco-friendly delivery vans and cargobikes to incorporate the concerns of the societal stakeholders and operational requirements of the business stakeholders. The mono-actor analysis revealed the heterogeneity of the stakeholders' preferences and clashing views regarding the optimal delivery fleet. This highlights the importance of incorporating a multi-stakeholder perspective in the planning and selection of suitable urban freight policies. Accordingly, a suitable implementation plan for the consolidated delivery fleet was proposed to reflect the perspectives and requirements of these stakeholders.

However, their implementations are sometimes failing. Involving stakeholders in the decision process is increasingly recognised to be a necessity to guarantee the adoption of these solutions by the sector and ensure their successful implementation. The objective of the paper is therefore to contribute to the development of a bottom-up approach where stakeholders are involved in the evaluation and selection of more sustainable strategies for city logistics. The authors present the MAMCA as a method which structures the consultation process of stakeholders. This approach was tested in a workshop in Brussels and the paper uses that consultation process as an illustration of the methodology. That application demonstrated the benefits of the MAMCA to ensure a productive workshop. The methodology allows the authorities to especially identify the priorities of the stakeholders in city logistics, to guide the discussion towards a consensus and to provide inputs for an eventual adaptation of the strategies.

Despite this, UCC often fails in practice, which indicates a knowledge gap. Furthermore, research within the field can be described as fragmented, transdisciplinary and fast growing. The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of the field by describing dominant categories and themes within the area, identify gaps in order to propose a future research agenda, and provide insights into the needs of practitioners. Design/methodology/approach: A systematic literature review (SLR) targeting journal articles based on UCCs has been constructed with a supplementary snowball approach. A content analysis was performed to categorise themes in the research on UCCs and to identify research gaps, both within and outside the categories identified. Findings: Despite substantial research on UCC, very little research ends up in academic journals. In all, 56 articles address UCC. The most common topics were the role of stakeholders, design of distribution structures and transport resources, environmental and social consideration, and economic considerations. Much focus is directed towards finding “optimal” solutions and designs for potential initiatives with very little, if any, consideration to financial viability or the management of the UCC initiative. Research limitations/implications: This research points out existing gaps in the literature and proposes a future research agenda with UCCs as the focus. For example, although environmental and social arguments are often applied to justify the implementation of UCCs, few studies measure or evaluate their impact. Another important research gap is the economical consideration, both how to generate revenue and how to consider economies of scale. Practical implications: The practical contribution of most studies is directed towards municipalities. Few findings are presented in a way to support companies. Additionally, by bridging the gaps related to how stakeholders can collaborate and describe what is happening in a UCC, practitioners can use such information as guidelines. Originality/value: The results provide a research agenda for the fragmented research targeting UCCs, supporting the viability of future initiatives.

We present a cost allocation model that is based on solution concepts from cooperative game theory, for allocating the operational costs associated with the collaboration. It is assumed that the municipality is willing to carry some cost to ensure a stable collaboration for the potential benefits received, e.g., reduced traffic congestion in the city. The model is applied to some illustrative examples, and the cost allocation results are discussed. It is shown that the role of the municipality may be decisive in achieving a stable collaboration between the freight forwarders, and further that the municipality does not necessarily need to contribute to covering the costs.

Parcel lockers offer a response to retail and last mile delivery challenges provoked by the rapid growth of e-commerce worldwide. Retailers, logistics service providers, communities, and other stakeholders now face issues due to increased volumes of goods sold online. The introduction of parcel lockers to service algorithms is intended to address these issues by involving consumers in the service process. However, the existing research fails to provide knowledge about the customer's view on this new technological solution. This study followed a focus group design and built on grounded theory to provide insights into customer value in relation to parcel lockers. These insights can contribute to both research and practice.

While they offer the promise of improved access to goods and reduced travel for consumers and delivery vehicles, the integration of these systems in cities, and their impact on access, generally and by mode are understudied. This paper explores the development, site characteristics and regional location characteristics of Parcel Lockers in five South East Queensland (SEQ) cities, Australia, and discusses implications for urban and transport planning in a car-oriented city. Micro level site analyses for 45 locker locations provide information on facilities (e.g. access by modes and universal accessibility, ground level, tenure type, safety). Hierarchical cluster analysis helps identify categories of locations. Suburb-level census and land use data as well as distance from transportation infrastructure and other Australia Post facilities were gathered and used to compare regional suburbs with and without Parcel Lockers. Logistic regression identifies the suburb level characteristics associated with the presence of a Parcel Locker (n = 273). Parcel Lockers in Brisbane are generally located at Australia Post locations, on commercial streets, shopping centres, suburban arterials and industrial parks. Automobile access and nearby parking is nearly ubiquitous, whereas alternative transport access is limited. Though site locations are constrained by commercial decisions, proximity to highways, to public transport, population density, a good balance of jobs and population, and higher rates of household Internet access are associated with the presence of a Parcel Locker. Documenting and assessing site characteristics and regional location of Parcel Lockers can help ensure its optimal and adequate integration and distribution across the region to satisfy city and transport planning goals. In its current state, Australia Post's Parcel Lockers partially meet the objectives of a sustainable city.

In these cases, literature shows that the combined use of smaller vehicles and mobile depots is a practice to be explored more deeply. This paper focuses on the use of motorized cargo tricycles alongside conventional trucks in a mobile-depot-based procedure to accommodate the restrictions imposed on conventional freight vehicle access in densely populated areas. Therefore, a new method is proposed to identify the impact on service level, emissions footprint and delivery cost of this distribution strategy. Moreover, we assess the environmental benefits of this new distribution strategy by estimating the reduction in various pollutant emissions attributable to the adoption of smaller, more agile last-mile delivery vehicles. The analyses have shown that greenhouse gas emissions and local air quality pollutants can be significantly cut by the use of cargo tricycles and mobile depots in the last mile delivery. With respect to cost, we can show that the mobile-depot-based delivery setup yields slight cost advantages over the traditional setups for neighborhoods that are characterized by low average delivery drop sizes.

The growth of this e-commerce creates an opportunity to use new technology and mobile applications to create valuable connections between companies and customers; which gives companies the opportunity to leverage the collective intelligence of theses online communities. This work aims to benefit from these connections to finish the last leg of delivery through the use of crowdsourcing. A pool of citizens are contracted as needed to deliver products from several lockers distributed around the city to consumers' doorsteps. Deliveries occur during a set time window for each customer taking into consideration drivers' capacity and availability time. We propose two Integer Linear programming (ILP) formulations that minimize the total reward paid to crowd-workers through optimum assignment of parcels to drivers and optimum routing for each driver. The proposed models are solved using Lingo optimization software and their run times are compared. ,crowdsourcing;electronic commerce;home deliveries;last mile delivery;parcel lockers,crowdsourcing;electronic commerce;integer programming;locks (fasteners);routing algorithms;collective intelligences;home delivery;integer linear programming;last mile;mobile applications;on-line communities;optimization software;parcel lockers;mobile commerce,"Frehe, V., Mehmann, J., Teuteberg, F., Understanding and assessing crowd logistics business models-using everyday people for last mile delivery (2017) Journal of Business & Industrial Marketing, 32 (1), pp. 75-97; Chen, C., Pan, S., Using the crowd of taxis to last mile delivery in e-commerce: A methodological research (2016) Service Orientation in Holonic and Multi-Agent Manufacturing, pp. 61-70. , Switzerland, Springer International Publishing; Dell'Amico, M., Hadjidimitriou, S., Innovative logistics model and containers solution for efficient last mile delivery (2012) Procedia-Social and Behavioral Sciences, 48, pp. 1505-1514; Van Duin, J., De Goffau, W., Wiegmans, B., Tavasszy, L., Saes, M., Improving home delivery efficiency by using principles of address intelligence for B2C deliveries (2016) Transportation Research Procedia, 12, pp. 14-25; Iwan, S., Kijewska, K., Lemke, J., Analysis of parcel lockers' efficiency as the last mile delivery solution-the results of the research in Poland (2016) Transportation Research Procedia, 12, pp. 644-655; Morganti, E., Dablanc, L., Fortin, F., Final deliveries for online shopping: The deployment of pickup point networks in urban and suburban areas (2014) Research in Transportation Business & Management, 11, pp. 23-31; Edwards, J., McKinnon, A., Cherrett, T., McLeod, F., Song, L., The impact of failed home deliveries on carbon emissions: Are collection/delivery points environmentally-friendly alternatives?

For this reason, in recent years several city authorities have promoted different measures to foster the implementation of urban consolidation centers. However, only a few real-world publicly promoted initiatives have succeeded due to several operational, financial, and regulatory issues. In this paper, we investigate different city logistics solutions for a mail delivery service in the city of Austin, Texas. We do that by using a model for the multi-depot vehicle routing problem with heterogeneous vehicle fleet for urban consolidation centers (UCCs) based on metaheuristics. The model considers the total costs and the environmental impacts of alternative UCC configurations and policy scenarios. According to the results, combinations of regulations and subsidies addressing both traffic inbound and outbound the facilities could be the most efficient and environmental friendly approaches. Factors like demand and traffic congestion have a significant impact on the overall performance of the solutions.

The objective is to maximize the total profit, consisting of the revenue from customers who use the service, minus the facilities’ fixed and operational setup costs, the discounts in the delivery costs for customers who need to travel in order to collect their parcels, and the loss of potential customers who are not willing to travel for service. The problem is expressed as a 0–1 integer linear program. We show that it is equivalent to the well-known Uncapacitated Facility Location Problem. We then solve the modified problem, and apply it to an industrial-sized network.

The study has been inspired by the need to evaluate the Urban Distribution Center initiative, i.e., Jogja Inland Port by local government that has been hampered due to lack of participating companies. Design/methodology/approach: The proposed framework consists of two steps of analysis. First, spatial analysis to generate alternative locations using weighted Geographical Information System data; second, fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making to select the best location. Fuzzy Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution was applied to deal with multi-criteria, multiple stakeholders, and uncertainty. Accessibility, security, connectivity of multi-modal transport, costs, environmental impact, proximity to customers, proximity to suppliers, resource availability, expansion possibility, service quality, are taken as the decision criteria. Local government of Yogyakarta province, practitioners, and logistic expert, are involved as representative participants in evaluating the Urban Distribution Center location of Yogyakarta Special Region Province. Findings: The proposed framework has indicated that the Jogja Inland Port is not the best alternative. A joint warehouse managed by a group of private companies located in Berbah (Sleman district) appears to be the best alternative location for Urban Distribution Center. Consistent results are also found by using other approaches (Intuitionistic Fuzzy Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution and Set Pair Analysis). Research limitations/implications: In addition to the government, expert, and practitioners that involved in this study, future research could engage local residents as decision makers to refine the results, as various stakeholders may come up with different preferences. Practical implications: From a practical point of view, the application of combined approach (integrating spatial analysis using weighted Geographical Information System data and fuzzy multi-criteria decision making) is a promising approach in dealing with Urban Distribution Center location problem which is characterized by multi-criteria, multiple stakeholders, spatial-related issues, and uncertainty. Social implications: The unsuccessful establishment of Jogja Inland Port implies that Urban Distribution Center location problem is a complex system, involving multifaceted factors that should be considered simultaneously. Originality/value: The research proposes a framework to evaluate and select the appropriate location for Urban Distribution Center through combined approach of weighted Geographical Information System data and fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making which involves relevant stakeholders.

These UDCs have to meet daily demands for delivery on time of their allocated urban areas. However, these demands may not be met when they exceed the available capacities of these infrastructures. In addition, some UDCs are unavailable when their capacity to deliver is affected by random unavailability or preventive maintenance actions. In this case, the entire site or a part of it will be ""Out Of Service"". Our goal is to improve the efficiency of these UDCs in terms of availability and satisfaction of demands and this via preventive maintenance actions as well as the inter-UDC collaboration strategy. For instance, unavailable UDCs can be delegated to others UDCs as a subcontractor to ensure deliveries for their allocated urban area on time. The choice of subcontractor will depend on distance, environment and availability criteria. In doing so, we define a mathematical model for searching the best distribution correlated to a maintenance plans using a subcontracting strategy for all UDCs. Moreover, we consider delay for the next periods with an expensive penalty. Finally, we present a numerical example illustrating the advantages of our approach.

Previous studies have shown that urban freight consolidation increases the load factor of Delivery Vehicles (DVs), reducing the vehicle-kilometres driven and thus reducing negative freight transport externalities in urban areas. The objective of this paper is to explore the possible impact of the number of Urban Consolidation Centres (UCCs) on the external costs of last-mile deliveries in freight transport and to determine the possible contribution of such consolidation scenarios to external cost mitigation. Therefore, several consolidation scenarios are considered assuming different numbers of UCCs in operation. A new consolidation scheme is proposed with more than one UCC to serve a given city area. Input data are obtained from a roadside questionnaire survey with a sample of 1617 drivers at 9 access roads to an urban area as part of the NOvi Sad TRAnsport Model (NOSTRAM) study. Externalities are calculated using the IMPACT methodology and discussed for different urban freight consolidation options. The best option is identified, and the results indicate that properly planned, organised and managed urban freight consolidation can significantly reduce transport externalities. The main research results showed that all of the proposed consolidation options increase the total driving distance in an urban area. However, some consolidation options significantly reduce the driving distance of less manageable vehicles in last-mile deliveries (long-haul heavy-and light-duty vehicles). Consequently, the external costs ranged from 2108.3 to 5420.5 EUR for the consolidation option, whereas the current state externalities are 2791.4 EUR. Thus, more small UCCs may provide better results than the central centre even in medium-sized cities.

Yet increasing level of logistics sprawl in megacity associated with various urban diseases has been creating new challenges for selecting the location of DCs. In this paper, a mathematical model is proposed to enable an efficient and green distribution system by minimizing the total cost, which contains economics cost, environmental cost, and socio-economic cost. The model is a mixed-integer linear programming model and is characterized with quantifying and pricing the multifarious negative externalities. To verify the effectiveness of the model, a case study is conducted. IBM ILOG CPLEX is adopted for optimization purpose. Then, a sensitive analysis is provided to investigate the impact of various parameters coefficients on the results. This new method provides a good reference for municipal management department in planning urban DC and will contribute to promoting urban green development by reducing the negative externalities of distribution operation.

In the past decades, many public and private initiatives have struggled to gain broad stakeholder support and thus remain viable. Researchers and practitioners have only recently recognised stakeholder acceptance of urban freight solutions as a challenge. A first step in achieving convergence is to understand stakeholder needs, preferences and viewpoints. This paper proposes and applies an approach to identify the main stakeholder perspectives in the domain of urban freight transport. We use Q-methodology, which originates from social sciences and psychology, to record subjective positions and identify the dominant ones. We explain the approach, operationalise the method for the domain of urban freight transport and apply it to stakeholder groups in the Netherlands. We find four dominant perspectives, reflecting how stakeholders normally take positions in the urban freight dialogue. Important findings concern disparities between industry associations and some of their membership, divergent views about the expected role of public administration, and the observation that the behaviour of shippers and Logistics Service Providers (LSP) appears to be inconsistent with their beliefs. All these factors together can act as a barrier to the implementation of urban freight consolidation concepts. The Q-methodology is valuable for eliciting perspectives in urban freight and is a promising tool to facilitate stakeholder dialogue and, eventually, convergence.

In fact, it is a major contributor to climate change and global warming. Also, it causes increasing gas emissions, congestion, noise and traffic safety issues. Drawing on the successful experience of the Bristol-Bath Freight Consolidation Center, which has been serving the city center of Bristol since 2002 and started covering Bath in 2012, this study analyses benefits provided by an Urban Consolidation Center (UCC). Based on a case study analysis, it aims to identify the key successes of a UCC scheme by focusing on the stakeholders’ perspective. An analysis of the benefits coming from the sustainability scheme, such as polluting emissions reduction rates, is also provided.

Whilst the majority of urban traffic is created by personal travel, freight vehicles make a relatively large contribution per vehicle to congestion, pollution and severe accidents. The European Commission (EC 2011) estimates that 6% of all EU transport carbon emissions are from urban freight. For these reasons, a well-structured portfolio of measures and policies oriented towards more sustainable and efficient management of supply chain activities carried out in urban areas is needed, in order to reduce negative externalities related to urban mobility and improve economic performance. In recent years, there has been enthusiasm amongst commentators that shared-resource economic models can both create new commercial opportunities and address policy problems, including in the transport sector. Within the city logistics subsector, this new model is exemplified by the emergence of Urban freight Consolidation Centres (UCCs). UCCs replace multiple ‘last-mile’ delivery movements, many of which involving small consignments, by a common receiving point (the consolidation centre), normally on the periphery of a city, with the final part of the delivery being shared by the consignments in a small freight vehicle. Such arrangements can represent a good compromise between the needs of city centre businesses and their customers on the one hand (i.e. high availability of a range of goods) and local and global sustainability objectives on the other. At the same time, by sharing logistics facilities and delivery vehicles, UCCs offer added-value services to both urban economic actors, such as retailers, and network logistics providers. However, UCCs add to the complexity of logistics chains, requiring additional contracts, communications and movement stages. These arrangements also introduce additional actors within the supply of delivery services, notably local authorities present as promoters and funders, rather than simply as regulators, companies specialised in the UCC operation, and companies, which provide specialist technologies, such as electric delivery vehicles. UCCs therefore also represent an example of multi-stakeholder collaboration. Drawing on the results of a 2013 survey in Bristol (United Kingdom) and a further survey carried out in 2015 in Cagliari (Italy), the present paper will provide an in-depth comparison of the differences in the perceptions of urban freight users and stakeholders towards UCCs. Retailers involved in the survey carried out in Bristol showed high satisfaction with the delivery service provided by the UCC. Different topic areas (e.g. timeliness, reliability, safety) are examined through analyses of both qualitative and quantitative data. The survey carried out in Cagliari investigated the inclination of potential users to join a UCC scheme. The comparison between the two cities considers factors such as the nature of business holding (e.g. SME versus multiple retailers), operational practices (e.g. pattern of deliveries) and operating subsector (e.g. food versus no food). An analysis on the barriers to the implementation of UCCs in Bristol and in Cagliari is provided at the end of the paper.

City logistics models can be effective in solving complicated problems such as traffic congestion, air pollution, accidents, and high energy consumption rate. The present paper proposes a bi-objective mathematical model for designing a city logistics distribution network in order to minimize the economic and environmental costs as well as the response time. The proposed model would make decisions on the location and allocation problems in the city logistics distribution network. In fact, the objective of the problem is to select some fixed sites in order to construct the city distribution centers. The demand for commodities is considered probabilistic and the network is modeled based on the queuing theory. Furthermore, in the proposed model, the policy of putting tax on carbon and applying the low-carbon emission resources are used for establishment at the city distribution centers. Afterwards, in order to validate the proposed model, a numerical example is generated and, then, the results obtained from solving the model via epsilon constraint method are presented. Analysis of the results in the present study indicates that the proposed model was highly efficient in achieving its objectives. Finally, there are some suggestions for future studies that can be taken into account.

Through this way of delivery, it is possible to mitigate many issues related to the traditional home delivery (e.g. missing delivery, complex routing planning, and traffic delays). Despite this, there are still obstacles that prevent the CDP to become a dominant mode of parcel delivery. Through semi-structured interviews to companies working in the courier, express and parcel sector, this work aims to understand the enablers and barriers to the spread of the CDP mode of delivery, with a focus on the Italian market.

A combination of the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) methodology with a geographic information system (GIS) has been applied to identify the influencing factors and perform the analysis of the alternatives. A case study focused on the city of Zaragoza, and specifically to a Spanish postal parcel delivery company, has been carried out to assess the model behavior. For this, a representative sampling of the postal districts and sections of Zaragoza has been performed, identifying the characteristics of the study areas. Next, sections and all possible locations have been identified and selected for study. Finally, the AHP methodology has been applied for the prioritization of alternatives. Results have shown that the operative criterion, accessibility (both pedestrian and with vehicle), time availability and safety are the most important elements to focus on, for solving the location selection problem. In addition, the use of GIS allows analyzing diverse urban areas in an agile and effective way.

Multi-level distribution is an already-known strategy employed by businesses, and the classic formulation of the Two-Echelon Vehicle Routing Problem (2E-VRP) reflects the perspective of a single provider, without regarding the routing decisions of other parties. The lack of coordination between providers executing their individual schedules and, consequently, the lack of a holistic approach to urban traffic may cause further problems. Additionally, the various stakeholders (government, businesses, residents) may have conflicting objectives. The main contribution of this paper is a first-time multi-objective formulation of the multi-provider (or multi-commodity) heterogeneous vehicle 2E-VRP, from a city government perspective within an Urban Goods Movement context, demonstrating with didactic examples the potential benefit of this approach to all parties involved, simultaneously considering potentially conflicting objectives.

Croce 191, Venice, I-30123, Italy","With 25% of CO2 transport-related emissions, urban freight mobility is a relevant cause of climate change. Its optimization is a main aim of the Sustainable Urban Logistic Plans. Currently, the CO2 analysis of such plans is mostly based on a Tank-To-Wheel approach, which does not consider fuel production and distribution, thus not providing a comprehensive evaluation of its carbon effects. In this paper, we propose an alternative two-step approach: after quantifying CO2 emissions through a Well-To-Wheel methodology, which assesses the entire energy pathway of the fuel, we valuate them economically, using a meta-analysis of 700 studies. We test this model to assess the carbon potentialities of a new Urban Consolidation Centre (UCC) in the city of Lucca, Italy. Our results indicate a potential yearly saving of up to 190 tCO2 (which corresponds to about €10,000 of social cost savings). These benefits are mostly obtained through third funds, which make the investment financially sustainable for the municipality. With adequate adaptations, the model can be used in other urban areas to assess the carbon potentiality of different transport measures. Furthermore, an integration of the long-distance freight movement can provide the total CO2 contribution of freight transport.

The aim of many policy agendas is to reach cleaner cities with less disturbance from the distribution vehicles. Several suggestions have been put forward and tested in research and practice, such as access restrictions, multimodal transport, and use of cleaner vehicles. In this paper, we develop a case for a more sustainable freight distribution within cities using an ex ante case study. The idea of the mobile depot is built on the iteration between historical transitions within cities and contemporary developments in urban freight distribution, and then analyzed ex ante both quantitatively in calculations and qualitatively in two stakeholder workshops. The idea is integrated and multimodal, based on a mobile depot (e.g., a bus, truck, barge, or tram) that circles the city and connects to low emission last mile delivery options such as LEVs (Light Electrical Vehicles) or cargo bikes. We found that such a system can be environmentally and socially better for the city context, while maintaining economic viability above a certain utilization rate of the mobile depot for the transport operators.

In particular, a number of projects have been developing with the aim of overcoming the negative impact of urban parcel delivery and making it more efficient and sustainable, from both the operations and environmental standpoints. However, most of these initiatives are more focused on technical solutions, regardless of the potential long-term economic feasibility and fitting with the stakeholders' needs. In order to take into account the actual feasibility of CL initiative, this paper presents the case study of the Urban Electronic Logistics (URBeLOG) project, carried out with the aim to develop an ICT platform to support and improve urban last-mile logistics in two pilot cities, namely Turin and Milan (Italy). The definition of the business model of the solution has been obtained through two sessions of the Business Model Canvas wherein all the partners of the project together with a representative of the public authority have taken part. The project combines the emphasis on the ICT solution with a stakeholder-driven approach to business model design.

However, many UCCs strongly rely on government subsidies and are granted a short life because of their inability to reach financial sustainability. Despite the interest from both the practitioners and the research community in this city logistics scheme, there are a limited number of quantitative contributions that investigate the financial viability of UCC schemes. This paper provides a comprehensive theoretical framework for testing the financial viability of UCC cross-docking and consolidation operations and applies it to a specific case of a UCC servicing Brussels. Major cost categories are identified and human resources are pinpointed as a major cost category. The paper demonstrates that profitable operations are in theory possible but that profits are highly fragile and subject to efficient use of resources. The paper identifies a series of operational metrics that drive the profitability of UCC operations and highlight that the efficient organization of distribution operations has a major influence on its financial viability. Finally, the paper discusses the influence of the size of vehicles and service area on the UCC profitability.

All the same, researchers have rarely described business model components relevant to city logistics. In response, the purpose of this article is to analyse critical factors for viable business models of city logistics initiatives involving UCCs. Following an extensive literature review and multiple-case study of five initiatives with UCCs, we identified seven critical factors of viable city logistics business models: the ability to scale up and down the UCC solution; an ability to continuously develop and adapt to a dynamic environment; the important entrepreneurial role of the initiator as well; the acknowledgment of society; ability to innovate new services; logistics and supply chain management competence; and the ability to take full advantage of advanced IT. All seven factors describe continuously redeveloped business models seeking to seize new and unexpected opportunities, yet also indicate that city logistics systems require local authorities and municipalities to act as initiators, enablers, and customers. The models also underscore differences between purely commercial and purely municipal city logistics initiatives.

By collecting the goods destined to the target area and consolidating deliveries into one large delivery made by high-load vehicles, urban consolidation centres can relieve congestion and improve air quality. Significant benefits also accrue to the participating retailers, e.g. improved staff productivity and safety, the provision of pre-retailing services and recycling of packaging. The paper draws on the experiences of the Bristol-Bath freight consolidation centre (BBFCC), established in 2002 to serve Bristol city centre and uniquely extended in 2011 to cover Bath, each served by electric lorries; it appraises the benefits of shared ‘last mile’ freight services focusing in particular on the perspective of its users: the participating retailers.

Although there are numerous pilot projects and test cases, many UCCs are granted only a short life because they fail to attract a sufficient number of customers. Evidence from literature shows that the cost-attractiveness of UCC solutions for their users plays a major importance in their decision to use these facilities. Indeed, since UCCs involve additional service costs for their customers, in order to be financially attractive, they must demonstrate their ability to decrease delivery costs further in the transport chain, through distance or time gains. Despite the significant interest of the practitioners and the research community in these facilities, there is a lack of knowledge and quantitative tools for assessing the costs of delivery operations and the potential savings by use of UCCs. In this paper, authors propose an analytical approach to estimating costs of deliveries with and without the UCC based on the description of the logistics behaviour of the urban stakeholders from the literature. The analytical framework is then applied to a case of a UCC servicing Brussels. The study shows that the main costs of deliveries are time-related costs and that the use of the UCC can indeed decrease them. The main elements that influence the cost attractiveness of the UCCs are the characteristics of a delivery operations (e.g. number of stops, average number of cargo units per stop or the type of actor who performs the delivery), the characteristics of the UCC (e.g. its location, the service price or the possibility of overnight deliveries) and the characteristics of the services area (e.g. size of the town or delivery density).

These conditions are shown by compact formulas obtained by continuous approximations representing the cost of the stakeholders involved: society, regular carriers, consolidation facility operator and environment. The domain of the retailer density variable that always produces negative effects on each stakeholder has been identified. The envelope of this domain does not depend on vehicle costs and other site-related parameters. On the other hand, there is a critical density of receivers that makes the carrier cost savings higher than the CF operator costs.

This is motivated by the need of UDCs to satisfy daily demand in time under a high service level in allocated urban areas. Moreover, these demands could not be satisfied in individual cases because the delivery rate can be less than daily demand and/or affected by random failure or maintenance actions of vehicles. The scope of our work is to focus on a UDC, which needs to satisfy demands in a finite horizon. To that end, we consider a distribution policy on two sequential plans, a distribution plan correlated to a maintenance plan using a subcontracting strategy with several potential urban distribution centers (UDCs) and performing preventive maintenance to ensure deliveries for their allocated urban area. The choice of subcontractor will depend on distance, environmental and availability criteria. In doing so, we define a mathematical model for searching the best distribution and maintenance plans using a subcontracting strategy. Moreover, we consider delay for the next periods with an expensive penalty. Finally, we present a numerical example illustrating the benefits of our approach.

In response to these problems, the concept of city logistics emerged, for the purpose of planning, organizing, coordinating and controlling physical and information flows in order to find a compromise between efficient freight distribution in urban areas and protection of the environment. A typical city logistics initiative is the Urban Freight Consolidation Centre (UFCC), the benefits of which are significant. Its financial issues though represent a huge problem for public administrations. However, a large customer network, comprising retailers participating in the initiative, could make the UFCC a self-financing scheme. The key to expanding the scheme is closely linked with marketing campaigns and customer care. Therefore, customer care analysis represents an important tool in developing UFCC schemes. In this paper, a new Customer Satisfaction Index (CSI) is proposed for evaluating UFCC service quality. The new index, named CSImod, is a modified version of the traditional CSI, but places greater emphasis on customer dissatisfaction, so as to analyse the most critical areas of the service with a view to improving them. The index has been tested using experimental data collected within the CIVITAS RENAISSANCE Project, in which the Bristol and Bath Freight Consolidation Centre (BBFCC) scheme was evaluated. The evaluation was done from a user perspective, i.e. the participating retailers. The CSImod places more importance on the most dissatisfied customers making it possible to understand why they are dissatisfied and with what. Thus, it is possible to intervene with the aim of improving those areas of the service that are perceived as the worst. In spite of the high level of satisfaction with the overall service provided by the BBFCC, thanks to the CSImod the analysis pointed out that some retailers are dissatisfied with the delivery time arrangements and also with deliveries that were getting wet, issues about which the BBFCC manager was totally unaware. The CSImod could be used by UFCC operators to extend the network of the retailers involved and could therefore provide an implicit solution for making the scheme self-financing.

Their main goal is to ensure sustainable development in modern cities. The paper proposes an approach based on forward and reverse flows in urban logistic. To that end, we present a location-allocation of logistics platforms in a reverse logistics system. We, then, locate allocation and evaluate their effect on logistic platforms. In doing so, we present a mathematical model of the city logistics platform to specify location-allocation problem. Our model considers both flows: urban freight and reverse logistics. Subsequently, we improve city logistics platform's financial situation by reducing operating costs. Finally, we use a numerical algorithm for optimization and illustration purposes.

Larger ships combined with increased container throughput require more yard space and generate more traffic, straining the urban fabric in the vicinity of the port. A promising solution to this problem is the development of urban intermodal container terminals (IMTs) that interface with both road and rail (or possibly inland waterway) networks. This raises two linked choices; where to locate the intermodal terminals and what will be their likely usage by multiple shippers, each having a choice of whether or not to use the IMT as part of an intermodal transport chain. The use of an IMT by a shipper indicates the shipper's choice of intermodal transport, which comprises a combined use of a high capacity mode (rail or barge between the port and the IMT) and trucks (between the IMT and the cargo origin or destination). The overall problem therefore comprises a mode choice problem embedded within a facility location problem. This paper employs the method of entropy maximisation to combine a logit mode choice model with a facility location model, leading to a non-linear mixed integer programming model. The principal features of the entropy maximising facility location model are illustrated by small and large numerical examples.

Mobile rack warehouses increase the space utilization by providing only a few open aisles at a time for accessing the racks. Whenever a stock keeping unit (SKU) is to be retrieved, neighboring racks mounted on rail tracks have to be moved aside by a strong engine, so that the adjacent aisle opens and the SKU can be accessed. As moving the heavy racks takes considerable time, the resulting waiting time determines large parts of the picking effort. It is, thus, advantageous to sequence picking orders, such that the last aisle visited for the preceding order is also the first aisle to enter when retrieving a subsequent picking order. We formalize the resulting picking order sequencing problem and present suited exact and heuristic solution procedures. These algorithms are tested in a comprehensive computational study and then applied to explore managerial aspects, such as the influence of the number of open aisles on the picking effort.

The proposed model is a non-linear mixed integer programming problem, which decomposes into an IMT location sub-problem and an IMT choice sub-problem linked in one direction by the choice of IMT location(s) and in the other by dual variables relating to cost sensitivity and IMT capacity. The principal features of the model are illustrated by a numerical example based on the state of NSW, Australia, where new IMTs are planned.

Therefore, using discrete-event simulation to evaluate a terminal seems obvious and is often used in the literature. On the other hand, mathematical optimization represents a powerful method that has been successfully used to solve a wide range of logistical problems. Simulation allows for modeling logistics systems with almost unlimited complexity very close to reality, but finding the best system configuration is difficult and time-consuming. In contrast, mathematical optimization has the ability to make complex decisions and find (near) optimal solutions. Real-world logistic systems, however, can only be solved on a lower level of detail without stochastic behaviors. In this article, we present a modeling framework for the operational planning of a transshipment terminal that closely links both methods in order to make use of their complementary advantages. Thus, we are able to handle a large number of decisions, such as (un)loading dock and sorting destination assignments, and consider complex automatic sorting systems as well as manual handling activities with stochastic elements. The approach is evaluated on the example of a parcel transshipment terminal using three different input data scenarios.

To improve urban freight transportation, stakeholders explore alternatives by searching for carefully located freight facilities for storage, sorting and consolidation to reduce the number of freight vehicles used. We propose a tool to support the decision makers to choose suitable location for these facilities by re-examining a set of alternative solutions via post-evaluation deliberation using Genetic Algorithm (GA). Using this tool, we are able to provide good alternative solutions with the flexibility to tighten or loosen certain resources/constraints for a case study to determine urban consolidation center for urban retail clusters.

An urban consolidation centre is regarded as a solution that can reduce those negative impacts of freight vehicles on the city. However, previous experience has demonstrated the challenge that these centres face in being self-sustaining. Given their positive effects on the city, authorities have supported these logistics schemes with different types of accompanying measures. In order to bring to practitioners an overview of these measures, the paper presents the results of a literature review where the different measures are classified according to their financial support, their regulatory support and their indirect regulatory support.

However, few studies have examined how retail stores perceive the services a UCC could provide. The purpose of this paper is to explore retail stores’ potential demands for different services that a UCC could provide in order to foster the development and implementation of UCC solutions aimed towards more economically feasible business models. Design/methodology/approach: Structured interviews were conducted with employees at 72 retail stores. Qualitative, as well as quantitative analyses, were conducted to identify the potential demands of the retail stores. Findings: The authors have provided arguments why retail stores might be interested in UCC services, and thereby potentially pay for them. Improved customer service to stores’ customers might not be a valid argument. The authors point to the cost aspect: stores expend resources that a UCC could provide in a more cost-efficient manner. Research limitations/implications: The findings contradict previous studies to some extent, as it indicates that a UCC may actually not enhance customer service in retail stores. Instead, the findings point to the importance of considering the potential advantages according to economies of scale that are facilitated by UCC services. Practical implications: Taking the perspective of the stores is important in order to identify arguments for why they should pay for the services provided by a UCC. Social implications: Financially viable UCC solutions are needed in order for the initiatives to be maintained and thereby provide a long-term decrease in the environmental and social footprints caused by urban freight. Originality/value: This study answers the call for research addressing retailers’ perspective in urban logistics, as it takes a demand-driven perspective of the development of UCC services. Furthermore, by highlighting services requested by retail stores, it can guide the financing of UCC initiatives, an aspect that has been lacking.

One of the most important issues is the optimization of the interconnection amongst the interurban and urban sections of the supply chain, where the role of the Freight Transport Interchanges (i.e. Freight Centers) has been fundamental. The key issue is three fold and the optimum solution lies between: a) the selection of the most appropriate location for the establishment of each facility, b) the identification of the facility's attributes that should match the interest area's needs and c) the evaluation of the concept as considered to be part of the local policies and measures promoted or planned for the area of interest. The answer to the afore mentioned issues is provided through a two level approach incorporating the development of two discrete, but successive decision making supportive evaluation tools: a methodological approach to provide a solution to the facility location problem for Freight Centers and an integrated evaluation framework used for the assessment of the operation of the specific Freight Center category, the Urban Consolidation Centers (UCC). Both methodological frameworks are based on selected performance indicators, incorporating divergent stakeholders' interests considering conflicting business models and operations.

In order to achieve reasonable allocation of the site of logistics distribution center, an improved optimization algorithm for Drosophila melanogaster is proposed in this paper, and function optimization problem and site selection of logistics distribution center are chosen as the objects of study. Function optimization problem verifies that improved fruit fly optimization algorithm exhibits faster convergence rate and higher convergence precision, so it can be applied in other research fields. A mathematical model for site selection of logistics distribution center is established according to the coordinates of logistics distribution centers in 31 cities and their demand for goods and materials. Besides, improved fruit fly optimization algorithm is applied for optimization solution to achieve the optimal allocation of distribution path and save cost. The simulation result indicates that the algorithm has the advantages of fast convergence rate and high precision.

By reviewing, this research systemises the current state of urban freight transportation and its relevant issues to provide a more solid basis for further research opportunities. This research examines that current challenges are primarily related to urban sprawl, lack of scientific data, financial concerns and stakeholder acceptability. Moreover, legal, practical and ecological barriers are highly important both for the field of urban freight as well as for the implementation of urban consolidation centres (UCCs). Solutions to overcome the defined issues are provided e.g., the need of detailed planning and establishing credible business models. Based on this review, areas of concern and the impact of possible new changes are identified. Solutions are provided as well as the importance of implementing flexible policies, restrictions and preferences regarding urban freight.

This relatively recent concept responds to the need for feasible and sustainable last mile logistics solutions that contribute to reductions on not only costs but on congestion and environmental effects, particularly in dense cities. Decisions on a supply level involve network design, which includes urban facilities location. In this context facilities are called urban or city distribution centers, micro distribution centers, satellites platforms or just satellites. On other hand, vehicle fleet related decisions need to be also customized to this particular urban distribution context, specifically dealing with multi-mode selection, fleet size, smaller vehicle capacities (i.e. city-freighters), power technology, vehicle autonomy, and inclusive, vehicle design, etc. Literature suggests there is still an opportunity in terms of optimization modeling and methodologies to address these issues. This work revises the drivers motivating the topic, the last mile distribution network elements, and establishes an explicit connection between urban network design and the actual development and use of more environmental and suitable vehicles for urban freight.

Through the pairwise comparison of the two different supply chain interchanges, a decision support tool is provided to the terminals’ operators and their customers and partners, namely shippers, forwarders, transport companies, users or customers. The evaluation of the terminals’ performance is elaborated based on a tailored multi criteria Key Performance Indicator (KPI)-based assessment framework, while the selection and significance (weight) of the incorporated criteria and respective KPIs is predetermined by the involved stakeholders through a multi stakeholder participation scheme using the pairwise comparison according to the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) approach. ThPA terminal is ranked first according to its performance pertaining to the role of an intermodal interchange for the wider geographical area of Thessaloniki, however K+N terminal’s performance index was slightly lower, while in several KPIs and criteria it seems to perform better.

Despite the potential positive environmental and social impact, the main obstacle remains the lack of a sustainable business model. The goal of this paper is to understand how to organize UCC viability as a concept providing environmental and social benefits while at the same time providing a sustainable business model (social and logistical value propositions of multi-beneficial relations between the involved stakeholders). A research framework will be designed to analyse and evaluate financial viable UCCs. The framework consists of four main stream components, namely: organizational integration, revenue streams, key-resource provisioning and buyer-supplier relation. These four types of relations result in the so called ORKB-framework to analyse the created added value. The research framework is applied and evaluated for the following urban consolidation centres: Regent Street in London, Bristol/Bath, and BinnenStadService in Nijmegen. With the development of the framework we want to reveal some of the uniqueness for each specific situation in order to address the UCC-environment more effectively when the dynamics regarding value creation and the needs of the involved stakeholders are better understood.

Due to e-commerce's generic specificity, functioning of the deliveries in e-commerce on B2C market is based on home deliveries. Due to influence on the growing demand for deliveries, which consequently could have the impact on traffic and congestion problem as well as city environment, it is important to look for the alternative measures, which will help to reduce this negative impact. In recent years a very interesting and popular solution became parcel lockers as the efficient last mile delivery system.

Layout of the distribution centers is very important in terms of product conservation at the required service level and delivering of products with minimum cost to the customer from distribution centers. Therefore, the layout design of distribution centers should be handled with a smart decision system. In this study, the layout design of a fruits and vegetable hall, which is a kind of urban distribution center, is investigated for two different scenarios: (1) assignments of the brokers to the stores and (2) assignments of the products to the stores. The study suggests the most suitable allocation models for the inner layout of distribution center. In the first phase, the requirements of the mathematical model to develop the decision making system for the layouts of distribution center that will be determined. In the second phase, allocation models will be developed and solved for fruits and vegetables halls in Istanbul.

Urban consolidation centers (UCCs) have been set up to facilitate such consolidation all over the world. To the best of our knowledge, most - if not all - of the UCCs operate on volume-based fixed-rate charges. To achieve environmental sustainability while ensuring economic sustainability in urban logistics, we propose, in this paper, a bicriteria auction mechanism for the automated assignment of last-mile delivery orders to transport resources. We formulate and solve the winner determination problem of the auction as a biobjective programming model. We then present a systematic way to generate the Pareto frontier to characterize the tradeoff between achieving economic and environmental sustainabilities in urban logistics. Finally, we demonstrate that our proposed bicriteria auction produces the solutions that significantly dominate those obtained from the fixed-rate mechanisms. Our sensitivity analysis on the willingness of carriers to participate in the UCC operation reveals that higher willingness is favorable toward achieving greater good for all, if UCC is designed to be nonprofit and self-sustaining.

To this end, a comparative analysis is conducted addressing two Greek urban intermodal freight terminals located at the port of Thessaloniki (ThPA) and Kuehne+Nagel (K+N)'s premises. The assessment of the terminals' performance relies on a tailored multi-criteria Key Performance Indicator (KPI)-based evaluation framework, whereas the selection and significance of the incorporated criteria and KPIs is predetermined by the relevant responsible stakeholders, who imposed their viewpoint through an analytic hierarchy process. Results showed that ThPA was ranked first according to its performance pertaining to the role of an intermodal interchange; still, K+N's performance index was only 8.5% lower than ThPA's, while in specific KPIs it seems that it performs in a better way.

Emerging from the current conceptual trends in operations field, a new constraint to be included to the existing VRP parameters is the depot mobility. A practical example of such a problem is planning a route for an Unmanned air vehicle (UAV) deployed on a mobile platform to visit fixed targets. Furthermore, the range constraint of the UAV becomes another constraint within this sample case as well. In this paper, we define new VRP variants by introducing depot mobility (Mobile Depot VRP: MoDVRP) and extending it with capacity constraint (Capacitated MoDVRP: C-MoDVRP). As a sample use case, we study route planning for a UAV deployed on a moving carrier. To deal with the C-MoDVRP, we propose a Genetic Algorithm that is adapted to satisfy the constraints of depot mobility and range, while maximizing the number of targets visited by the UAV. To examine the success of our approach, we compare the individual performances of our proposed genetic operators with conventional ones and the performance of our overall solution with the Nearest Neighbor and Hill Climbing heuristics, on some well-known TSP benchmark problems, and receive successful results.

The aim is to locate a set of urban distribution centers (UDCs) and to connect them via a ring in which massive flows of goods will circulate. Goods are transported from gates located outside the city to a UDC, and either join a second UDC through the ring before being delivered in electric vans to the final customers or are delivered directly to the customers from the first UDC. The reverse trip with pickup and transportation to the gates is also possible. A delivery service path starts at a particular UDC, then visits a subset of customers and ends at the same UDC, another UDC, or a self-service parking lot (SPL). A pickup route can start from an SPL or a UDC and ends at a UDC. The objective is to minimize the sum of the installation costs of the ring, flow transportation costs, and routing costs. The MRLRP belongs to the class of location-routing problems (LRP). We model it with a set-partitioning-like representation of delivery and pickup trips and arc-flow elements to describe goods transportation in the ring and between the ring and the gates. We present three approaches to solving the MRLRP: an exact method for small-size instances, a matheuristic for instances of a larger size, and a hybrid approach that applies the exact method to the columns output by the matheuristic. Numerical results are provided for an exhaustive set of instances, obtained by extending benchmark instances of the capacitated LRP with additional MRLRP features.

And the models focus on both equity goals and efficiency goals. The time satisfaction functions as the measure of service level reflects the differences between urban and rural demands. The system of customers and distribution centers is considered to be an M/M/p queuing system. The queuing discipline allows demands transfer when the distribution center is busy. The hypercube model is provided to calculate the probability of centers being available. The objective functions include equity objectives such as minimizing envy, minimizing Gini coefficient and maximizing lexicographical order, and efficiency objectives such as maximizing demands covered and satisfaction. The models are solved by a tabu search algorithm and tested on a real world data set from the distribution system. It is proved that the P-median model is efficiency optimization; the minimize envy model is equity optimization; the maximize lexicographical order model can achieve the equity-efficiency tradeoff.

It is believed to bring cost savings and environmental benefits with the right setting. This paper demonstrates an alternative modeling framework to examine, from the strategic planning perspective, the effectiveness of urban delivery consolidation in terms of monetary logistics cost, energy consumption and PM2.5 emissions with respect to a number of operational (e.g., rent cost, customer demand) and policy factors (e.g., commercial vehicle size restriction in city centers). The framework consists of two key modeling components: the Continuous Approximation (CA) method to model urban delivery (the so-called last-mile delivery) and the Motor Vehicle Emission Simulator (MOVES by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency) to estimate the energy consumption and PM2.5 emissions associated with the logistics activities. It is found that the potential logistics and environmental benefits of UCC could come from either improving the utilization of the vehicle capacity through consolidation, or shifting the more expensive storage cost from customers in the city center to the less expensive UCC rent cost—due to a less centralized location and/or government subsidy or other cost sharing mechanisms—outside of the city center. However, UCC could achieve those benefits compared to non- consolidation strategies only under certain conditions, for example when there is an economy of scale or high customer density (i.e., high shipping volume) in the service area. The paper discusses in detailed under what assumptions and conditions UCC could work. Study limitations and future work are also presented.

The article aims at evaluating potential location of UDC for sugar commodity using a combined approach that comprises two stages: spatial analysis and multi-objective mixed-integer linear programming. Results demonstrate that different locations of UDC correspond to different costs and environmental implications. It is suggested that a new UDC for the sugar commodity can be located at the east part of the city outskirt.Using more than two UDCs in the studied case appears to be not economically and environmentally beneficial.

In these urban terminals, freight flows from interurban carriers are consolidated and transferred to a neutral last-mile carrier to perform final deliveries. This operation would reduce both last-mile fleet size and average distance cost. Our UCC modeling approach is focused on continuous analytic models for the general case of carriers with different market shares. Savings are highly sensitive to the design of the system: the increment of capacity in interurban vehicles and the proximity of the UCC terminal to the area in relation to current distribution centers. An exhaustive collection of possible market shares distributions are discussed. Results show that market shares distribution does not affect cost savings significantly. The analysis of the proposed model also highlights the trade-off between savings in the system and a minimum market share per company when the consolidation center is established.

Among all available solutions, Urban Consolidation Centre is an appreciated one. Indeed, it is supposed to reduce pollution, trucks' congestion and to improve the livelihood of city centre. Nevertheless, it is far from obvious that UCC are efficient and viable. The aim of this study is to provide answers to two questions: can an UCC be viable? Does the shape of a city affect the profitability of an UCC? We present a preliminary work based on a comparison between three morphologies to give some clues.

Roosevelt 50, CP 165/4, Brussels, BE-1050, Belgium","This paper describes a methodology that was used in order to establish strategic scenarios for city distribution of goods in the Brussels-Capital Region (BCR) using Urban Consolidation Centres (UCCs). Recently, UCCs received a lot of attention as a solution to decrease the environmental impact of urban freight transport in the Brussels-Capital Region. However, despite the growing interest from both public and private actors, many questions regarding their practical implementation remain. In fact, there are a large number of uncertainties with regards to the implementation of the consolidation scenarios, such as the number, location and size of the UCC(s), the vehicle fleet, the regulatory and market framework or the operational agreements. This leads to a large number of possible scenarios. In this paper, authors describe a scenario-planning methodology that was applied in order to select a limited number of scenario themes. Authors present several quantitative models that were used to evaluate possible scenarios and select the most relevant ones.

Despite the potential positive environmental and social impact, the main obstacle remains the lack of a sustainable business model. Therefore UCCs are often heavily subsidised and tend to disappear as soon as the subsidies stop. This paper reports on a social cost-benefit analysis (SCBA) of an operational UCC in the Belgian city of Antwerp. The SCBA is based on real data and volumes. It concerns a private initiative that is not dependent upon subsidies and is located in an area with considerable problems (e.g., average delays of 28%). Results show that the consolidated deliveries are beneficial for society. Based on current volumes during the start-up period it is, however, not financially viable. The business volume lies considerably higher. This study shows that there is potential to reach a break-even turnover. Outcomes are linked to the transferability of the concept to other urban areas.

First, this study analyzed the functional zones of urban green logistics centers for agricultural products based on low-carbon idea. A method was also proposed to calculate the area of each functional zone. Moreover, this study proposed a layout planning innovation method of urban green logistics centers for agricultural products based on logistics motion line analysis and logistics intensity calculation.

The TSDSM model is based on the integration of the multi-criteria method of Weighted Linear Combination (WLC) and the modified Dijkstra algorithm within a geographic information system (GIS). The GIS is used for processing spatial data. The proposed model makes it possible to plan routes for green vehicles and maximize the positive effects on the environment, which can be seen in the reduction of harmful gas emissions and an increase in the air quality in highly populated areas. The scheduling of delivery vehicles is given as a problem of optimization in terms of the parameters of: the environment, health, use of space and logistics operating costs. Each of these input parameters was thoroughly examined and broken down in the GIS into criteria which further describe them. The model presented here takes into account the fact that logistics operators have a limited number of environmentally friendly (green) vehicles available. The TSDSM was tested on a network of roads with 127 links for the delivery of goods from the city logistics center to the user. The model supports any number of available environmentally friendly or environmentally unfriendly vehicles consistent with the size of the network and the transportation requirements.

It is evident that urban freight distribution requires innovative solutions that are capable of improving the efficiency of transport whilst promoting innovative use of renewable energy, thus reducing energy consumption and associated GHG emissions while adopting and not stifling economic development. In this context, six Mediterranean cities (Barcelona, Bologna, Piraeus, Rijeka and Valencia)) collaborated with the purpose of contributing to the improvement of energy efficiency on urban freight transport as part of the SMILE Project (2015) (SMart green Innovative urban Logistics Models for Energy efficient mediterranean cities project), funded by the MED Programme. The SMILE project aims to improve the energy efficiency of Mediterranean cities through the promotion of innovative 'green' and cost effective solutions for urban freight logistics, addressing the target of green and smart urban development. This paper shows the results of the live test of smart city urban logistics solutions in the cities of Barcelona and Valencia that consisted of combining the use of electric tricycles and Transhipment terminals (or Urban Consolidation Centres) for the last-mile delivery of parcels and small shipments. A thoughtful analysis of the quantitative outcomes of the pilot test in both cities are presented from different perspectives: economical, operational, energy efficiency, environmental and social.

Being the sources and sinks of transport activities, Europe's cities are strongly affected by the resulting undesirable effects of transportation. This applies in particular to North West Europe (NWE), one of the most urban regions in Europe. NWE therefore stands in urgent need of solutions for efficient urban freight logistics. Focusing on the last mile of freight deliveries the INTERREG IVB NWE project LaMiLo (Last Mile Logistics) addressed this issue. The project promoted Urban Consolidation Centres (UCCs) as they allow and encourage transport consolidation as well as modal shift. Decoupling the last mile at the city borders, large vehicles are used for bundled, long haul transports outside the city whilst sustainable transport means are used inside. In the knowledge that UCC attempts with huge government subsidies have been made several times before but rarely succeeded, the core of the LaMiLo project was to enable environment for UCC operations that accomplish a sustainable last mile and can as well be transformed in successful business models. Thereto, UCC concepts were operationalised and implemented in a number of pilots in metropolitan areas and cities all around NWE:Paris: A UCC was field-tested to which freight was brought by truck and afterwards delivered by cargo bikes.Netherlands: Central hubs were put into operation to streamline the home delivery of parcels. Thereto, a Freight Circle service was launched in the cities of Nijmegen and Maastricht which used e-bikes and enabled customer-specific delivery times.London: A UCC was set up to bundle goods for the public sector which were destined for the boroughs of Camden and its partners Enfield and Waltham.Brussels: A UCC was launched at the Port of Brussels offering warehouse services and deliveries to retailers in the city. The key results gained from the studies primarily include the demonstration of UCCs as possible last mile solutions. Beyond their economic performance, their environmental effects as well as their social impacts were evaluated. Exemplary results include that all the pilots contributed towards emission reduction and total distance travelled through city centres and residential areas. Gained best practice and lessons learnt about the examined UCC concepts were discussed and shared at transnational level to encourage relating solutions for further cities.

It is based on two models designed to estimate the road space consumption of Inter-Establishment Movements (IEMs) and End Consumer Movements (ECMs). Two kinds of evolution of the environment are considered: the long term evolution and the seasonal fluctuation of the economic activity. We then present how a scenario involving an Urban Consolidation Centre (UCC) can be modelled. First, we evaluate which movements are potentially transferable to the UCC. Then, we define a catchment area. Finally, we evaluate the efficiency of the UCC by referring to continuous approximation methods.

This paper studies optimization model of chain retailing enterprise in logistics distribution system which is constituted by one region distribution center, multiple urban distribution centers, and multiple retailing stores under random requirement. Retailing store location and independent decision model as well as corresponding joint decision model of logistics distribution network design are established. Solution methods of various independent decision models are provided. In addition, Lagrangian relaxation and coordination mechanism of sub-gradient algorithm-based coordination mechanisms are constructed to realize joint decision. Finally, effectiveness of joint decision model and coordination mechanism is proved by examples.

With Singapore's mild restrictions on the vehicle types or the time windows for the last-mile delivery, we believe that with proper technology in place, an Urban Consolidation Center like the Tenjin Joint Distribution System in Fukuoka Japan may be implemented to achieve cost reduction with some degree of privacy preservation. Participating carriers keep their respective private orders and have the option to get their remaining shareable orders consolidated with those from the other carriers' fleet. To this end, we propose in this paper a double auction mechanism that enables such consolidation with an objective to maximize the total cost savings attained by all participating carriers. Our experimental results on 5 zones of delivery in Singapore CBD demonstrate that the proposed double auction is able to bring about reductions in the number of inter-zone travels, thereby producing cost savings to the participating carriers.

This phenomenon has highlighted the importance of conceiving new delivery strategies in order to deal with the increasing challenges of an internet-driven society. In this context, last mile logistics, i.e. the concluding distribution process to the end customer is particularly critical (Wang et al., 2014). One of its biggest problems is related to missed deliveries. The authors aim to analyse one of the solutions recently introduced to minimise missed deliveries, i.e. Parcel Lockers (PLs). More in detail, our objective is to develop an analytical model to assess the costs and the environmental impact of the distribution process based on the use of PLs and compare them with the ones of traditional Home Delivery (HD). The paper adopts a quantitative approach. The core of the research is represented by an Activity-based estimation model, which was developed and verified by following a three-step methodology: (i) Description of the last mile delivery phases in the two considered shipment options, (ii) Modelling of the environmental impact and costs produced by the two alternative processes, (iii) Application of the model to a base case, performance of sensitivity analyses and validation of results. We find that PLs generally cause less operational costs and carbon emissions than HD, although benefits are not homogeneously split among couriers and customers. The paper represents a starting point to bridge the gap found in the extant literature regarding the combined evaluation of e-commerce delivery processes from a financial and environmental perspective. The paper is also relevant for practice as it provides couriers with a reliable tool to support their decision-making activities and benchmark their environmental and economic performances",b2c e-commerce;costs;environmental impacts;last mile logistics;parcel lockers,,"Agatz, N.A.H., Fleischmann, M., Van Nunen, J.A.E.E., E-fulfillment and multichannel distribution -A review (2008) European Journal of Operational Research, 187 (2), pp. 339-356; Bayles, D., E-logistics & e-fulfillment: Beyond the buy button (2002) UNCTAD Workshop 2002, , Paper Presented At, Curacao; Brummelman, H.J., Kuipers, B., Vale, N., (2003) Effecten Van Packstations Op Verkeersbewegingen, , (Impacts of Locker Points on Mobility), TNO Inro, Delft; Chaston, I., Entrepreneurial marketing (2016) Sustaining Growth in All Organisations, , New York, NY: Palgrave; Peter, M., Chopra, S., (2001) Supply Chain Management: Strategy, Planning, and Operations, pp. 28-34. , Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice-Hall; (2015) 2015 Government GHG Conversion Factors for Company Reporting: Methodology Paper for Emission Factors, , www.ukconversionfactorscarbonsmart.co.uk/, DEFRA, [online], available at:, (accessed 20 July 2015); Edwards, J.B., McKinnon, A.C., Cullinane, S.L., Comparative carbon auditing of conventional and online retail supply chains: A review of methodological issues (2011) Supply Chain Management: An International Journal, 16 (1), pp. 57-63; (2015) China Ecommerce: 2015 Market Update, , eMarketer .

The development of urban container terminals with interface to road, rail or waterway networks is seen as a promising solution to these problems. The terminals are expected to be common user facilities, where each shipper has the choice of using it through the choice of rail or barge transport in the moving the containers between the port and terminal, and truck to/from the destination/origin or alternatively using truck only between the port and the origin/destination. The terminals are also expected to perform auxiliary activities such as warehousing and empty container storage thereby allowing these activities to be relocated to the terminals to provide extra revenue. This study employs an entropy framework to embed distribution and model choice models within a facility location problem such that the mode and distribution models influence the location choice of terminals, which in turn conditions the choice of mode and cargo destinations. The overall model was decomposed using Lagrangian relaxation techniques and is solved to optimality. Key features of the model were demonstrated using NSW, Australia, as a case study and data on import containers. The model reveals the key factors governing the distribution of containers in urban areas and the influence of the distribution on the optimal location for intermodal terminals.

CLT shows direct effects on increment of traffic volume especially in urban areas, which further results in negative environmental effects such as air pollution and noise as well as increased number of urban populations suffering from bronchitis, asthma, and similar respiratory infections. By applying the green p -median model (GMM), negative effects on environment and health in urban areas caused by delivery vehicles may be reduced to minimum.

However, the process of establishing UCC as a demonstration measure within the set time frame was ultimately stopped without success. By using the experiences from this process, the paper provides a more solid basis for renewed efforts at implementation in the future. With basis in implementation theory, the study identifies key barriers to implementation of UCC. Findings indicate that the barriers are primarily related to financial concerns and stakeholder acceptability. However, institutional, practical and legal barriers are also of significance. Strategies to overcome the identified barriers are suggested, most importantly the need for establishing a credible and sound business model. The study makes use of perspectives from political science regarding implementation theory in order to facilitate urban freight policy. As such, it represents a novel scholarly approach in the field of urban freight research. The evaluation framework can be useful for similar studies to come and for policymakers in the design and implementation of new policy measures for urban freight.

Integrating the economic, environmental, and social dimensions of sustainable development, this paper presents a new evaluation system for the location selection of a CLC from a sustainability perspective. A fuzzy multi-attribute group decision making (FMAGDM) technique based on a linguistic 2-tuple is used to evaluate potential alternative CLC locations. In this method, the linguistic evaluation values of all the evaluation criteria are transformed into linguistic 2-tuples. A new 2-tuple hybrid ordered weighted averaging (THOWA) operator is presented to aggregate the overall evaluation values of all experts into a collective evaluation value for each alternative, which is then used to rank and select alternative CLC locations. An application example is provided to validate the method developed and to highlight the implementation, practicality, and effectiveness by comparing with the fuzzy Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) method.

This paper proposes a discrete event microsimulation model as a tool useful to design a freight interchange warehouse and, particularly, to manage the exchange of freights between heavy lorries, coming from extra-urban regions, and small electric vans used for urban distribution. In particular, the paper focuses on dimensioning the warehouse structure and handling means in order to optimize the operational activities in relation to inbound freight flows (vehicles from extra-regional areas) and outbound freight flows (urban distribution service). The micro-simulation model allowed ex-ante and ex-post evaluations proving to be a useful decision support tool in planning.

At the UCC, goods are consolidated based on their destinations prior to their deliveries into city centers. Typically, a UCC owns a fleet of ecofriendly vehicles to carry out such deliveries. Shippers/carriers that make use of the UCC’s service hence no longer need to be restricted by timewindow and vehicle-type regulations. As a result, they retain the ability to deploy large trucks for the economies of scale from the source to the UCC which is located outside the city center. Furthermore, the resources which would otherwise be spent in the city center can then be utilized for other purposes. With possibly tighter regulation and thinning profit margin in near future, requests for UCC’s services will become more and more common, and there is a need for a market mechanism to allocate UCC’s resources to provide sustainable services for shippers/carriers in a win-win fashion. An early work of our research team (Handoko et al., 2014) proposed a profit-maximizing auction mechanism for the use of UCC’s last-mile delivery service. In this paper, we extend this work with an idea of rolling horizon to give bidders more flexibility in competing for the UCC’s resources in advance. In particular, it addresses the needs of many shippers/carriers to be able both plan deliveries weeks ahead and at the same time bid for the UCC’s service at the last minute. Under our rolling horizon framework, the capacity of the same truck is up for bid in several successive auctions. To allocate truck capacities among these auctions under future demand uncertainty, we propose a virtual pricing mechanism which makes use of Target-oriented Robust Optimization techniques.

In many developed and developing countries, the effects of urbanization have increased city population. Such migration to cities is also attracting more movement of commodities into the city center. This research aimed to study the effectiveness and viability of urban distribution centers from a tactical viewpoint of planning for city logistics. A multiagent modeling approach with geographical information system support was used to test an urban distribution center (UDC) in Osaka City, Japan. The key findings from this research concluded that the UDC has potential for emissions reduction, but sustainability of the UDC is reliant on the UDC charges and carriers' sensitivity to the rate of charges",,developing countries;economics;emission control;freight transportation;geographic information systems;information systems;multi agent systems;sustainable development;warehouses;city centers;city logistics;current barriers;economic costs;economies of scale;emissions reduction;multi-agent model;urban distribution centers;geographical distribution,"Taniguchi, E., Thompson, R.G., Yamada, T., Modelling city logistics (1999) City Logistics I, pp. 3-37. , Institute of Systems Science Research, Kyoto, Japan; Visser, J., Van Binsbergen, A., Nemoto, T., Urban freight transport policy and planning (1999) City Logistics I, pp. 39-69. , Institute of Systems Science Research, Kyoto, Japan; Taniguchi, E., Thompson, R.G., Yamada, T., Van Duin, R., (2001) City Logistics-Network Modelling and Intelligent Transport Systems, , Pergamon, Netherlands; Browne, M., Sweet, M., Woodburn, A., Allen, J., (2005) Urban Freight Consolidation Centres-Final Report for the Department for Transport, , Transport Studies Group, University of Westminster, London; Quak, H.J., De Koster, M.B.M., Delivering goods in urban areas: How to deal with urban policy restrictions and the environment (2009) Transportation Science, 43 (2), pp. 221-227; Benjelloun, A., Crainic, T.G., Trends, challenges, and perspectives in city logistics Buletinul AGIR, , http://www.agir.ro/buletine/501.pdf, nr. 4/2009 Accessed July 1, 2014; Panero, M., Shin, H.-S., Lopez, D.P., (2011) Urban Distribution Centers-A means to Reducing Freight Vehicle Miles Traveled Final Report, , New York University Rudin Center for Transportation Policy and Management, New York; Taniguchi, E., Qureshi, A.G., (2014) Urban Consolidation Centers: The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly-The Japanese Experience, , https://coe-sufs.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Urban-consolidation-center_Japan.pdf, Volvo Research and Educational Foundations Center of Excellence for Sustainable Urban Freight Systems Peer-to-Peer Exchange Program.

The indications laid down by the European Union (UE) urge us to review urban spaces in order to transform degraded areas into smart areas and, therefore, restart a process of rebalancing and sustainability, with the goal of transforming cities into smart cities. The planning activity supports the social, economic, and technological change processes. The regeneration of disused areas creates opportunities for sustainable growth. This paper presents the issue of urban regeneration. A project of an urban distribution center, in a city logistics system, is designed for a disused railway area, located near the harbour in Reggio Calabria.

It is estimated to be responsible for 25% of CO<inf>2</inf> emissions and up to 50% of particles matters generated by the transport sector in cities. Facing that problem, the European Commission set the objective of reaching free CO<inf>2</inf> city logistics by 2030 in major urban areas. In order to achieve this goal, electric vehicles could be an important part of the solution. However, this technology still faces a number of barriers, in particular high purchase costs and limited driving range. This paper explores the possible integration of electric vehicles in urban logistics operations. In order to answer this research question, the authors have developed a fleet size and mix vehicle routing problem with time windows for electric vehicles. In particular, an energy consumption model is integrated in order to consider variable range of electric vehicles. Based on generated instances, the authors analyse different sets of vehicles in terms of vehicle class (quadricycles, small vans, large vans, and trucks) and vehicle technology (petrol, hybrid, diesel, and electric vehicles). Results show that a fleet with different technologies has the opportunity of reducing costs of the last mile.

A city logistics system introduced in an urban area is studied. The arriving freight, from national origins, is investigated, considering different modal alternatives. Different transport mode services and relative models to estimate principal attributes (times, costs and prices), are considered. The aim of the paper is to compare attributes modelled and revealed of different mode-service alternatives for long distance freight transport. An application in a real context is carried out, considering the city of Reggio Calabria in the south of Italy. The case study is relative to the organization of α city logistics system centered on an urban distribution center.

In order to meet customers' expectations short sorting intervals are required. If parcels are not loaded on time they miss their onwards connections within the network. However, the amount and characteristics of incoming vehicles and parcels changes over time and affects the sorting system performance and sorting intervals. This paper focuses on the structure of input data sets of parcel transshipment terminals. Five different data sets are developed e.g. by using kernel density estimation.

However, it generates also inefficiencies on social, economic and environmental aspects. A possible solution is the use of urban distribution centres in order to rationalise the deliveries and to operate the last miles with clean vehicles. Electric vehicles are gaining attention lately but some barriers remain. Since costs barriers were already investigated, the paper aimed at evaluating the difference of performances between a centre using a diesel truck and a centre using an electric vehicle. In order to do so, the operations of an urban distribution centre were modelled in a discrete event simulation and different scenarios were evaluated. The results showed that replacing a conventional truck by an electric van generates more traffic due to the limited payload of the van. However, the limited range does not entail the daily operations of the vehicle since a single night charge is sufficient. Better, the depth of discharge is found to be limited to a minimum of 60%. The results on the battery are similar in the second scenario where the conventional truck is replaced by an electric truck. In that scenario though, no influences are identified on the logistics performances of the urban distribution center.

Although several case studies have indicated that FCCs are beneficial to the operation of urban transportation systems, the implementation of this concept has proven difficult because the construction and operation of a FCC involves the coordination of different, and conflicting, stakeholders. Unlike other traditional approaches, this paper investigates the FCC development issue using experimental economics. First, profit functions are defined for involved stakeholders; based on those profit functions, four players-carriers, operators, government, and residents-bid on rent, financial incentives, and wages to maximize their own profits. Eight scenarios are analyzed and compared to determine potential influential factors and appropriate conditions for FCC decision making. Results show that public-private partnership lowers rent and increases wages, which leads to higher carrier, operator, and resident profits. A central location lowers rent, wages, financial incentives, and all stakeholders' profits. A larger carrier size benefits all stakeholders.

The paper draws on the experiences of the Bristol-Bath freight consolidation centre (BBFCC), established in 2002 to serve Bristol city centre and uniquely extended in 2011 to cover Bath, each served by electric lorries; it appraises the benefits of shared 'final mile' freight services, presenting a model for the evaluation of the reduction in traffic and polluting emissions based on Bristol, with a view to optimising future UFCC design. Data about the number of deliveries made by heavy goods vehicles (HGVs) of different types to the BBFCC and the number of deliveries made from the BBFCC to the two shopping centres covering a period of 17 months are analysed. The correlation between the type and number of HGVs delivering to the BBFCC and the number of deliveries made to the retailers by the BBFCC is explicated by means of a multiple linear regression model. Its development is based on analysing parameters as R Square value (total and adjusted), F-statistics and p-values for each coefficient. An estimation of the number of HGVs re-routing to the BBFCC and the pollutant emissions avoided in the urban centre is appraised. The pollutant emissions reduction is based on factors drawn from the UK National Atmospheric Emissions Inventory. Results suggest that the proposed approach may yield HGV movements avoided in Bristol city centre of 75.5% on average. Also, by considering the whole study period, reductions amount calculated is equivalent to 28,677 Kg of CO2, 122.29 Kg of NOx, 2.31 Kg of PM10, 20.32 Kg of CO and 9,854 Kg of fuel. Nevertheless, emissions reductions are significant, but currently limited by small scale, due to the low number of participants. Emissions reductions in the host cities are identified as a result of sharing delivery vehicles for the final leg. The regression model showed high correlation coefficient values (over 85%) for deliveries to the Bristol city centre thanks to the BBFCC. The linear regression models developed provide a useful tool for local authorities and logistics/transport planners in optimising the planning of UFCCs to reduce freight traffic, associated emissions and to improve logistics and transport performance.

At the UCC, goods are consolidated based on their destinations prior to their deliveries into the city centre. In many examples, the UCC owns a fleet of eco-friendly vehicles to carry out the deliveries. A carrier/shipper who buys the UCC's service hence no longer needs to enter the city centre where there might be time-window and vehicle-type restrictions. As a result, it becomes possible to retain the use of large trucks for the economies of scale outside the city centre. Furthermore, time which would otherwise be spent in the city centre can then be used to deliver more orders. With possibly tighter regulation and thinning profit margin in near future, requests for the use of the UCC's service shall become more and more common. In this paper, we propose a profit-maximizing auction mechanism for the use of the UCC's service. We first formulate the winner determination problem as mixed-integer program (MIP).

At the UCC, goods are consolidated based on their destinations prior to their deliveries into the city centre. In many examples, the UCC owns a fleet of eco-friendly vehicles to carry out the deliveries. A carrier/shipper who buys the UCC's service hence no longer needs to enter the city centre in which time-window and vehicle-type restrictions may apply. As a result, it becomes possible to retain the use of large trucks for the economies of scale outside the city centre. Furthermore, time which would otherwise be spent in the city centre can then be used to deliver more orders. With possibly tighter regulation and thinning profit margin in near future, requests for the use of the UCC's service shall become more and more common. In [1], the authors proposed a profit-maximizing auction mechanism for the use of the UCC's last-mile delivery service. In this paper, we extend that work with the idea of a rolling horizon to give bidders greater flexibility in competing for the UCC's resources in advance. In particular, it addresses the challenge that many shippers/carriers plan their deliveries many weeks ahead, and simultaneously allows last-minute bidders to compete for the UCC's resources.

These customer demands have increased the competition between businesses, and at the same time more complicated and longer supply chains have emerged as a result of the globalization of many businesses in their search for low-cost production locations and access to new skills. In response, hub-and-spoke systems are increasingly used to deal with product flows from many origins and to many destinations. As a result, a growing number of studies have examined the establishment of various forms of intermodal transshipment centers to minimize the use of roads in city centers and support the frequent and rapid replenishment of goods at retail and catering outlets. This study examined the establishment of a consolidation center servicing nearly 100 businesses that operated in an urban shopping mall in Southampton, United Kingdom. Through the review of numerous existing UK and international consolidation schemes and the examination of their operational characteristics, the study aimed to identify potential strengths, weaknesses, and risks that would impact the operation of the consolidation center. Various operational scenarios considering business take-up combinations, vehicle delivery mixes, fill rates, and back-load practices were examined to elucidate the potential transport and environmental effects of the consolidation scheme. To quantify and to verify these effects accurately, a multistage analysis framework, including data collection, map routing, emissions assessment, and scenario-building activities, was developed",,costs;crashworthiness;sales;supply chains;analysis frameworks;customer demands;freight consolidations;hub-and-spoke system;operational characteristics;operational scenario;scenario building;urban distribution systems;competition,"Higginson, J.K., Bookbinder, J.H., Policy recommendations for a shipment consolidation program (1994) Journal of Business Logistics, 15 (1), pp. 87-112; Higginson, J.K., Recurrent decision approaches to shipment-release timing in freight consolidation (1995) International Journal of Physical Distribution and Logistics Management, 25 (5), pp. 3-23; Cetinkaya, S., Bookbinder, J.H., Stochastic models for the dispatch of consolidated shipments (2003) Transportation Research Part B: Methodological, 37 (8), pp. 747-768; Zhou, G., Van Hui, Y., Liang, L., Strategic alliance in freight consolidation (2011) Transportation Research Part E: Logistics and Transportation Review, 47 (1), pp. 18-29; Browne, M., Sweet, M., Woodburn, A., Allen, J., (2005) Urban Freight Consolidation Centres, , Publication Transport Studies Group, University of Westminster, London; Klaus, P., German experiences with urban consolidation centres-do they have a future role?

This paper considers the problem of locating urban distribution centers and proposes an exact method, based on integer linear programming for strategic, tactical and operational decision-making. The aim is to solve, in an integer manner, location, sizing and operation (vehicle routing) problems in these logistics platforms. The model is validated using real-data taken from the city of SaintEtienne, France. Computational experiments are also carried out in order to compare the proposed model with existing procedures from the literature. Results show the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed model and its applicability in real decision-making for medium sized data sets.

We identify that this kind of collaborative network is, often, poorly evaluated and thus operates in a way that is neither sustainable nor efficient. By mobilizing several fields of knowledge, such as operational research, game theory, and transportation studies on real cases, we propose a solution to anticipate the activity level of a UCC and determine the condition under which it generates benefits for carriers. The aim is to provide a suitable aid to public decision makers in territorial management. The study concludes by an application of the method on the test case of the city of Saint-Etienne, France.

We focus on two categories of UDCs: those deployed to deliver to the city and located in peripheral areas and those located close to a specific area to serve it. Starting from an initial typology of experiments, obtained from a systematic analysis of 34 experiences (18 in France and 16 in Italy), we orient the study towards the analysis of six models of cooperative strategies set up to reach an economic viability of these platforms. Those models are studied on a four-element grid: steering, organization, development, and financing. The defined typology and the analysis of the six types of cases enabled us to determine the main elements that influence the search for economic viability in urban consolidation and distribution platforms.

The trailer is used as a mobile inner city base from where last-mile deliveries and first-mile pick-ups are done with electrically supported cyclocargos. In the morning and evening it is used to transport shipments from and to a peripheral depot. The MD was developed by TNT Express as a response to the challenging urban working conditions: narrow streets, mixed traffic, traffic congestion, congestion charging, environmental zones, etc. TNT Express tested this innovative concept in Brussels for a period of three months in 2013 as part of the European FP7 project STRAIGHTSOL. Regular TNT Express deliveries and pick-ups in Brussels are carried out from the TNT depot at the Brussels freight airport using diesel trucks for pallets and using diesel vans for parcels and documents. During the trial period, the parcels and documents destined for a part of the inner city were delivered and picked up through the MD. This new way of working resulted in a decrease of the number of diesel kilometres from 1.34 km per stop in the Business-As-Usual scenario to 0.52 km per stop in the Mobile-Depot scenario. This decrease can be linked to a positive environmental impact with, for example, 24% less emission of CO2 and up to 59% less emission of PM2.5. TNT Express was able to successfully integrate the MD in their operations. Service levels dropped slightly mainly due to the additional time needed to load the cyclocargos. However, none of the TNT customers complained about the quality of service. For TNT, delivering through the MD was twice as expensive as before. However, they feel it is possible tofurther decrease the operational costs by using the MD at its full capacity (the MD was only used at 40% of its full capacity) and by further refining the handling. A multi-actor multi-criteria analysis (MAMCA) of the MD concept revealed under which conditions it would become a more profitable concept to TNT Express: internalised external costs, higher capacity use and higher drop density. The MAMCA also revealed that the benefits are mostly for the other stakeholders, especially society.

A UCC is a logistics facility that is situated in relatively close proximity to the area that it serves. Goods destined for this area are dropped off at the UCC, and are sorted and consolidated onto goods vehicles for delivery to their final destinations, often using environmentally friendly vehicles such as electric and gas-powered goods vehicles, and electricallyassisted cycles. The development of UCCs since their first appearance in the 1970s is reviewed and the various types of UCC categorised. The freight transport and logistics advantages offered by UCCs are discussed. Case studies of four recent UCC trials are included. The objectives, operational and financial aspects and impacts of these UCCs are compared and their critical success factors identified.

We identify that many solutions for urban logistics are, most of time, badly evaluated. Indeed, the theory often predicts a positive effect but the reality is most of time counterbalanced. We tried to fill this gap by making use of innovative methods. To do so, we mobilize several domains of knowledge: operational research, game theory and transportation studies on real cases. We suggest a solution to anticipate the level of activity of an Urban Consolidation Center and determine the condition under which it generates benefit for a carrier using or not, the collaborative network. We present the result obtained by application of our method on the real case of the city of Saint-Etienne.

Box 43890, Lafayette, LA, United States","Location selection of Urban Distribution Centers (UDC) is crucial in the design of efficient logistics systems. Indeed, optimum UDC location plays a vital role in saving distribution costs and minimizing traffic congestion arising from freight movement. In this paper, we suggest a Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) approach to solve the Urban Distribution Center location /allocation problem under uncertain environment. The proposed approach involves identification of possible locations with the aim of selecting the smartest location for implementing an UDC. The ratings and the weight of each alternative and criterion are described by linguistic variables which can be expressed in triangular fuzzy numbers. The final evaluation value of each UDC location is also expressed using fuzzy logic theory. After calculating the difference of the final evaluation value between each pair of UDC location, a fuzzy preference relation matrix is constructed to show the degree of preferences of one plant location over another. After that, a smart ranking procedure is anticipated to determine the ranking order of all alternative locations. Finally, a numerical application is presented to illustrate the performance of the proposed approach.

The most common of these consolidation schemes are Urban Consolidation Centres (UCCs). However, many innovative experiences have been performed in the cities across the globe, offering a large panel of alternative schemes. In particular, many experiences have focused on downscaling the consolidation effort by bundling the goods much closer to the reception point. This paper aims in offering a closer view into different alternatives that exist regarding the physical microconsolidation of goods and to provide guidelines on selecting the most appropriate solutions for a specific city area. In order to do this, we will develop a transferability methodology, based on the study of case studies across the Europe. We will build on the current transferability methodologies developed under several EU projects and adjust them for the specific case of the micro-consolidation measures. This will lead us to the definition of the most important features for the transferability of the micro-consolidation measures. Based on this, we will establish for each feature a list of attributes for the transferability of the micro-consolidation devices, which will be prioritized according to their importance for the transferability success",micro-consolidation;transferability of urban freight transport measures;urban freight transport,city logistics;down-scaling;eu projects;important features;micro-consolidation;urban consolidation;urban freight transport;mechanical engineering;transportation;freight transportation,"Allen, J., Browne, M., Woodburn, A., Leonardi, J., The role of urban consolidation centres in sustainable freight transport (2012) Transport Reviews, 32 (4), pp. 473-490; Augereau, V., Dablanc, L., An evaluation of recent pick-up point experiments in european cities: The rise of two competing models?

However, it generates also inefficiencies on social, economic and environmental aspects. A possible solution is the use of urban distribution centres in order to rationalise the deliveries and to operate the last miles with clean vehicles. Electric vehicles are gaining attention lately but some barriers remain. Since costs barriers were already investigated, the paper aimed at evaluating the difference of performances between a centre using a diesel truck and a centre using an electric vehicle. In order to do so, the operations of an urban distribution centre were modelled in a discrete event simulation and different scenarios were evaluated. The results showed that replacing a conventional truck by an electric van generates more traffic due to the limited payload of the van. However, the limited range does not entail the daily operations of the vehicle since a single night charge is sufficient. Better, the depth of discharge is found to be limited to a minimum of 60%. The results on the battery are similar in the second scenario where the conventional truck is replaced by an electric truck. In that scenario though, no influences are identified on the logistics performances of the urban distribution center.

Packages are firstly delivered to urban distribution centers (UDCs) on the border of urban areas. Packages should therefore be delivered from the UDC to receivers within the urban area. Each package is characterized by an address and dimensions. FURBOT boxes are consolidated in the UDC with these packages. Each box is addressed to a temporary unloading bay and it is delivered there by a FURBOT vehicle. A virtual key and the actual address of the box will be communicated to all the receivers, allowing them to collect their packages from the box in a given time window. The paper concerns a methodology for the box consolidation which minimizes the overall distance travelled by receivers, taking into account the box capacity and the maximum walking distance the receivers accept to collect their packages.

The labor efficiency is a key performance measure in the PDI. In this study the focus is on developing a framework for improving labor efficiencies in a parcel transshipment terminal. The objective is to minimize the time required to transfer parcels from inbound trailers to outbound trailers. This paper is an exploratory study to developing a framework for a solution approach to solve large-scale parcel hub scheduling problems (PHSP). A binary integer programming (BIP) model is proposed along with a branch and bound (BaB) algorithm with lower and upper bounds. The computational study shows that the BaB algorithm is able to generate solutions for small-size problems. The proposed BIP model sets the ground work for developing solution approaches to much larger size problems.

They essentially help to alleviate traffic congestion, environmental issues, energy and costs. These facilities allow more efficient logistics systems to be established and facilitate the implementation of advanced information and cooperative freight systems. The optimal locations of the terminals induce the many attempts by researchers to build models with the aim of reducing costs. However, because of the uncertainty in the real world, the methods used are based on complex nonlinear models that they are very hard to apply. On the other hand, looking at these centers just from the cost point of view restricts us from considering other important issues. Thus, it is critical to optimize nonprofit aspects as well as profit aspects. For this purpose the mentioned problem gets worse when more than one objective is considered. In this research, the main goal is to minimize the cost and maximize the satisfaction level of customers in terms of fairness. A robust optimization approach with box constraints is used to face the uncertain demand.

The minimum total construction scale of mobile warehouse was taken as objective function, the region demand and service ability of mobile warehouse were taken as constraint conditions, and the meeting ant colony optimization(MACO) based on the set-covering problem of multiple granularities was put out. The demand points were regard as virtual particles, and K-means algorithm was used to cluster the particles. The preparation points of mobile warehouse were got from the divided particles, and the example verification was carried out by using traditional ACO and MACO respectively. Calculation result indicates that while traditional ACO is used, the computing time is 12.7144 s, the optimal solution number is 13, the most poor solution number is 15, the average solution number is 13, and the correct rate of solution is 79%.

The idea behind the urban distribution center (DC) is to provide buffer points where cargo and packages which are to be delivered to shops and businesses can be stored beforehand. At these centers, there will be other kinds of routing problems corresponding to other fairly similar distribution problems. In this paper, a new vehicle routing model (based on the known Time-Dependent Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows, TDVRPTW) has been carried out and a change in the traditional approach is proposed, by adopting a system in which some customers are served by urban DCs while remaining customers are served by traditional routes. This study is also motivated by recent developments in real time traffic data acquisition systems, as well as national and international policies aimed at reducing concentrations of greenhouse gases emitted by traditional vans. By using k DCs, the whole problem is now composed of k+1 problems: one special VRPTW for each DC in addition to the main problem, in which some customers and k DC are serviced. The model has been tested by simulating one real case of pharmaceutical distribution within the city of Zaragoza.

An international literature review has identified 114 UCC schemes in 17 countries (12 in the European Union (EU) and 5 outside the EU) that have been the subject of either a feasibility study, trial or a fully operational scheme in the last 40 years. The period from 2006 to 2010 has been the most active 5-year period in terms of UCC study, trial and scheme generation since the first UCC study was carried out in the early 1970s. Five countries account for the majority of all the 114 UCC schemes identified: France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and the UK. The vast majority of UCCs serve either all or part of an urban area. Examples of UCCs serving a single property (such as an airport or shopping centre) and construction sites have also been identified. Key organizational, operational, and financial issues that are critical to the success of UCCs are discussed. The traffic and environmental impacts of UCC trials and fully operational schemes are also reviewed.

A UCC is a logistics facility that is situated in relatively close proximity to the area that it serves. Goods destined for this area are dropped off at the UCC, and are sorted and consolidated onto goods vehicles for delivery to their final destinations, often using environmentally friendly vehicles such as electric and gas-powered goods vehicles, and electrically-assisted cycles. The development of UCCs since their first appearance in the 1970s is reviewed and the various types of UCC categorised. The freight transport and logistics advantages offered by UCCs are discussed. Case studies of four recent UCC trials are included. The objectives, operational and financial aspects and impacts of these UCCs are compared and their critical success factors identified.

It is based on the before and after evaluation of a trial led by a major stationery and office supplies company in which urban freight deliveries in central London made from a depot in the suburbs using diesel vehicles were replaced with the use of an urban micro-consolidation centre located in the delivery area together with the use of electrically-assisted cargo tricycles and electric vans. The results show that the total distance travelled and the CO2eq emissions per parcel delivered fell by 20% and 54% respectively as a result of this delivery system. However, the evaluation has also indicated that the distance travelled per parcel rose substantially in the City of London delivery area as a result of the electric vehicles having far smaller load limits in both weight and volume compared with diesel vans. But, at the same time, the trial system was able to virtually eliminate CO2eq emissions per parcel delivered in the City of London. The trial proved successful from the company's perspective in transport, environmental and financial terms. The company therefore decided to continue the operation beyond the end of the trial with it being officially launched during 2010.

In this paper, we present a multi-criteria decision making approach for location planning for urban distribution centers under uncertainty. The proposed approach involves identification of potential locations, selection of evaluation criteria, use of fuzzy theory to quantify criteria values under uncertainty and application of fuzzy TOPSIS to evaluate and select the best location for implementing an urban distribution center. Sensitivity analysis is performed to determine the influence of criteria weights on location planning decisions for urban distribution centers.The strength of the proposed work is the ability to deal with uncertainty arising due to a lack of real data in location planning for new urban distribution centers. The proposed approach can be practically applied by logistics operators in deciding on the location of new distribution centers considering the sustainable freight regulations proposed by municipal administrations. A numerical application is provided to illustrate the approach.

A UDC is a logistic site dedicated to decompose and consolidate freight directed to the city, by planning the routes and service time, restricting the traffic of trucks and increasing the load factor of feeder vehicles. A UDC can produce interesting impacts on the dynamics of urban freight distribution, but its success depends on many factors: an appropriate location; a wellbalanced presence of spaces and equipment; an efficient and effective organization of internal services; a connection with the surrounding area and with the related transport services; a management structure that meets different and complementary requirements; a capacity to support itself. The paper proposes an analysis of the functional organization of a UDC through a ""what if"" micro-simulation approach aimed at the UDC efficiency control. After a review of the state of the art, a procedure to implement a discrete-event micro-simulation model is described. Probability functions concerning the times of UDC activities are proposed.

To some extent, some common schemes of location are not application of the city distribution center as today's city has its own characteristic. We need to use some suited methods together to solve this problem. To the current status of urban congestion and high cost of logistics distribution cost, this paper had constructed distribution center location model in suburbs.

Increasing demands of the recipients (due to e-commerce development) leads to pressure and intensification of transporting freight through inner-city areas. This generates many unwanted results such as congestion, escalation of waste and environmental devastation, increased noise levels, greater than before, such as the risk of car accidents. An important alternative for traditional freight delivery are Urban Consolidation Centres. Utilizing UCC gives a chance to eliminate the harmful effects due to transporting freight by large-size vehicles through the city areas. This paper is focused on analysis of perspectives of urban consolidation centres development in Westpomeranian Region of Poland, concentrating on medium-size cities. For cities like Swinoujscie and Kolobrzeg implementation of urban consolidation centres is important for efficiency of freight delivery especially during holiday periods.

The consolidation centre in Nijmegen differs from initiatives in the past, distinguishing itself from other UCC initiatives by its focus on receivers rather than on carriers. After one year already 98 stores joined Binnenstadservice.nl and this number is still growing. Due to Binnenstadservice.nl, fewer trucks enter the city centre and fewer kilometres are driven. In this paper we provide insights into the local effects of the Binnenstadservice pilot after one year, such as air quality, inconvenience for residents and noise nuisance. The effects on local air quality and noise nuisance are limited, due to the amount of passenger and bus traffic remaining. Plans exist to start Binnenstadservice.nl franchises in other Dutch cities, which could result in making Binnenstadservice.nl a more serious partner for carriers to handle the transport of last mile distribution in cities.

To determine factors that caused the success or failure of UCCs in practice, a survey of 6 cases in Europe is conducted. The cases were selected because of the similarity of the service area of the UCC and the city centre of The Hague or because of the uniqueness of the UCC. To determine the possible success for a UCC in The Hague four scenarios are evaluated. Two major difficulties with implementing the UCC are the allocation of the costs and benefits and the willingness to cooperate of the transportation companies. Both consignees and transportation companies can benefit financially from using the UCC. The UCC operator, however, incurs the costs. The municipality should play a role in bringing the costs and benefits together.

We present the gradual relocation of parcel transport's terminals from the urban cores in the 1970s to the outer suburban today. We evaluate whether this movement of ""logistics sprawl"" (the historical trend towards spatial deconcentration of logistics terminals in metropolitan areas) has an environmental and CO2 impact on the Paris region. Representations of these gradual relocations are shown on maps using MapInfo and a centrographic analysis was conducted to evaluate an average of the deconcentration of terminal locations over the period 1974-2008. A centrographic analysis is a spatial analysis of geographic data using central tendency indicators. We, then, analyze the increased mileage resulting from these more distant terminals and we translate it into net added CO2 emissions. The main results of our research are that a net addition of 15,000 tonnes per year of CO2 emissions resulted from the change in location patterns of parcel and express transport terminals since the 1970s. In this paper, we discuss the methodology chosen to evaluate freight transport's CO2 impacts in Paris. The net CO2 impacts of terminals' relocation is also compared to the savings of CO2 emissions resulting from the city logistics' experimental schemes that have received much attention in the last few years in Paris. The last part of our paper explores potential strategies for preventing further logistics sprawl in the coming years and mitigating the congestion and CO 2 impacts of logistics in urban areas.

A review of the current structure and size of the hotel industry in London is included, together with growth forecasts. Survey work carried out at London hotels provides detailed insight into the sourcing arrangements and supplier selection policies used by respondents. This illustrates that the use of multiple suppliers for specific product categories is widespread among respondents. Stockholding facilities are also considered inadequate at many of the hotels surveyed. The results show that there is a large variation in the number of goods vehicle deliveries received by hotels. The delivery arrangements of many of the hotels result in deliveries taking place on-street and causing disruption and disturbance to neighbours. There would appear to be much potential scope for consolidation of deliveries and the use of a consolidation centre in the hotel industry in London. However, respondents show relatively little interest in the concept.

In this paper we investigate how Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA) can play a major role to be supportive in the pre-feasibility of these studies. In order to understand the supportive value of this methodology we have analyzed the effects of a new main road for public transport connecting several small cities combined with a new solution for freight problems in these towns. The new solution encompasses the development of a new public warehouse. This paper contains a detailed explanation of the methodology and we present some conclusions about the pre-feasibility of the new distribution centre and the supportive role of the methodology in terms of stakeholder participation. ,,,"Button, K.J., Pearman, A.D., (1981) The economics of urban freight transport, , The MACMILLAN PRESS LTD, Hong Kong; (1991) 'Plaatsen van stadsdistributiecentra: definitiestudie, , Coopers and Lybrand Management Consultants, Rotterdam; Crainic, T.G., Gendreau, M., Advanced Fleet Management Systems and Advisors: Converging Decision Technologies for ITS and E-Business, CD-ROM (2003) 10th World Congress on Intelligent Transport Systems, , Madrid, Spain; Diepens, Okkema, (2005), Medegebruik vrachtverkeer op Zuidtangent, in opdracht van Govera; Duin, J.H.R.V., Evaluation and evolution of the city distribution concept (1997) 3rd International Conference on Urban Transport and the environment for the 21st Century, pp. 327-337. , UT 97, Perugia, Italy; Duin, J.H.R., Munuzuri, J., Fighting the windmills: survey results on urban freight policies between Spain and the Netherlands (2006) Recent advances in city logistics, , Elsevier); Eijgenraam, J.J., Koopmans, C.C., Tang, P.J.G., Evaluation of infrastructure projects (2000) A guide to Cost-Benefit Analysis, , CPB-NEI; Florio, M., Vignetti, S., http://www.economia.unimi.it/uploads/wp/wp153.pdf, (accessed 9/9/2006); Haryashi, Y., Morisugi, H., International comparison of background concept and methodology of transportation project appraisal (2000) Transport Policy, 7 (1), pp. 73-88; Stedinet, G., (2006) Kilometerbesparing door bundeling, p. 2006. , April; Holguin-Veras, J., Wang, Q., Xu, N., Ozbay, K., Cetin, M., Polimeni, J., The impacts of time of day pricing on the behavior of freight carriers in a congested urban area: Implications to road pricing (2006) Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice, 40, pp. 744-766; Klaus, P., 'A future role for urban consolidation centres?

Because there are no revealed preference data, a stated-choice methodology is used. The stated-choice experiments present two alternatives - one using a private vehicle subject to various traffic regulations and one using the urban freight consolidation centre with varying cost and efficiency levels. Conventional discrete choice data modelling shows that the potential demand is influenced mainly by the distance of the parking bay from the shop, by access permit cost, by the service cost of the urban freight consolidation centre, and by the delay in delivery time. Simulations are then performed to assess how the potential demand is affected by various incentives and regulations affecting urban goods distribution.

A survey of city center organizations is described, and relevant delivery patterns (origin, destination, type of goods delivered) are compared with those from a previous feasibility analysis to determine UDC opportunities in Dublin. A real-life commercial example of a UDC is also described. Ireland's largest grocery distributor operates this UDC. The operational efficiencies and the wider benefits of the UDC are discussed. In addition, a commercial example of managing the last mile of deliveries through a city center delivery platform is detailed. The delivery platform is managed by a leading logistics service provider",,distribution of goods;strategic planning;service providers;sustainable freight distribution;urban distribution centers (udc);freight transportation,"Finnegan, C., Finlay, H., O'Mahony, M., Initial assessment of potential for urban distribution centers in Dublin (2004) Presented at 83rd Annual Meeting of the Transportation Research Board, , Washington, D.C; Whiteing, A.E., Edwards, S.J.F., Urban freight trans-shipment facilities: A european comparative study (1996) Presented at 28th Annual Conference of the University Transport Study Group, , Huddersfield, England; Ogden, K.W., (1992) Urban Goods Movement: A Guide to Policy and Planning, , Ashgate, Brookfield, Vt; Young, W., Ritchie, S.G., Ogden, K.W., Factors that influence freight-facility location preference (1980) Transportation Research Record 747, pp. 71-77. , TRB, National Research Council, Washington, D.C; Vermie, T., City of Rotterdam public works, ELCIDIS (2003) Final Report.
