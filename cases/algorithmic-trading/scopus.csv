The conventional wisdom is that the same trading strategy is not profitable for all stocks all the time. The selection of a trading strategy for the stock at a particular time instant is the major research problem in the stock market trading. An optimal dynamic trading strategy generated from the current pattern of the stock price trend can attempt to solve this problem. Reinforcement Learning can find this optimal dynamic trading strategy by interacting with the actual stock market as its environment. The representation of the state of the environment is crucial for performance. We have proposed two different ways to represent the discrete states of the environment. In this work, we trained the trading agent using the Q-learning algorithm of Reinforcement Learning to find optimal dynamic trading strategies. We experimented with the two proposed models on real stock market data from the Indian and American stock markets. The proposed models outperformed the Buy-and-Hold and Decision-Tree based trading strategy in terms of profitability. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Algorithmic trading; Reinforcement Learning; Stock market","Commerce; Decision trees; Financial markets; Learning algorithms; Profitability; Reinforcement learning; Algorithmic trading; Automated trading; Current patterns; Optimal dynamics; Q-learning agents; Q-learning algorithms; Research problems; Trading strategies; Electronic trading",,,,,,,"Alimoradi, M.R., Kashan, A.H., A league championship algorithm equipped with network structure and backward q-learning for extracting stock trading rules (2018) Applied Soft Computing, 68, pp. 478-493; Andriosopoulos, D., Doumpos, M., Pardalos, P.M., Zopounidis, C., Computational approaches and data analytics in financial services: A literature review (2019) Journal of the Operational Research Society, pp. 1-19; Calabuig, J., Falciani, H., Sánchez-Pérez, E., (2020), A.

We first construct an open-interest-weighted index with the high-frequency data of all commodity futures traded and then examine the predictability of the last half-hour return with both in-sample and out-of-sample tests. Consistent with findings in other markets, we show that the first half-hour return can readily predict the last half-hour return. We further demonstrate that the magnitude of this intraday momentum varies with volatility, trading volume, trade size, the sign of the first half-hour return, the type of commodity futures, and the launch of night trading. Additionally, this intraday momentum does not result from data snooping but has economic significance and remains robust under different index weighting and predictor calculation methods. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Commodity futures; High frequency trading; Intraday momentum",,,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC: 71790594, 71532009","This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 71790594 and 71532009 ).","Batten, J.A., Lucey, B.M., McGroarty, F., Peat, M., Urquhart, A., Does intraday technical trading have predictive power in precious metal markets?

The proposed method consists of two steps: i) sample selection, ii) portfolio optimization. First, in the sample selection, clustering algorithms including k-means, k-medoids, spectral and hierarchical clustering are applied to discover time windows (TW) similar to the recent time window. Then, after finding the similar time windows and predicting the market behavior of the next day, the optimum function along with the transaction cost is used in the portfolio optimization step in which, four algorithms including KMNLOG, KMDLOG, SPCLOG and HRCLOG are proposed for this purpose. The presented algorithms are applied on 5 different datasets with different characteristics including different markets, stocks, and time periods, and their performance has been evaluated. The results show that the provided algorithms in this paper, have better performance in terms of efficiency compared to the algorithms provided in the literature. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Algorithmic trading; Clustering; Data mining; Online portfolio selection; Pattern-matching","Commerce; Costs; Financial data processing; Financial markets; Hierarchical clustering; Pattern matching; Clustering approach; Market behavior; Online portfolios; Optimal portfolios; Portfolio optimization; Sample selection; Time windows; Transaction cost; K-means clustering",,,,,"Sharif University of Technology","This research has been financially supported by the Research Vice-Chancellor office of Sharif University of Technology for which the authors are thankful.","Abdi, M., Najafi, A., Online Portfolio Selection Using Spectral Pattern Matching (2018) Financial Engineering and Portfolio Management, 9 (34), pp. 175-192; Blum, A., Kalai, A., Universal portfolios with and without transaction costs (1999) Machine Learning, 35 (3), pp. 193-205; Borodin, A., Vincent, R.E., Machine Learning and Markets, Can we learn to beat the best stock (2004) Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, 21, pp. 579-594; Zhang, Y., Yang, X., Online Portfolio Selection Strategy Based on Combining Experts’ Advice (2017) Computational Economics, 50, pp. 141-159; Cover, T.M., Universal Portfolios (1991) Mathematical Finance, 1 (1), pp. 1-29; Cover, T.M., Ordentlich, E., Universal Portfolios with Side Information (1996) IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, 42 (2), pp. 348-363; Cover, T., Ordentlich, E., Universal portfolios with short sales and margin (1998) IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory - Proceedings, 174; Györfi, L., Urbán, A., Vajda, I., Kernel-Based Semi-Log-Optimal Empirical Portfolio Selection Strategies (2007) International Journal of Theoretical and Applied Finance, 10 (3), pp. 505-516; Györfi, L., Schafer, D., Nonparametric Prediction (2003) Advances in Learning Theory: Methods, Models and Applications, pp. 339-354. , IOS Press; Györfi, L., Lugosi, G., Udina, F., Nonparametric kernel-based sequential investment strategies (2006) Mathematical Finance, 16 (2), pp. 337-357; Györfi, L., Udina, F., Walk, H., Nonparametric nearest neighbor based empirical portfolio selection strategies (2008) Statistics & Decisions, 26 (2), pp. 145-157; Györfi, L., Vajda, I., Growth Optimal Investment with Transaction Costs.
