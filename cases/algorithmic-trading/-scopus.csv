The conventional wisdom is that the same trading strategy is not profitable for all stocks all the time. The selection of a trading strategy for the stock at a particular time instant is the major research problem in the stock market trading. An optimal dynamic trading strategy generated from the current pattern of the stock price trend can attempt to solve this problem. Reinforcement Learning can find this optimal dynamic trading strategy by interacting with the actual stock market as its environment. The representation of the state of the environment is crucial for performance. We have proposed two different ways to represent the discrete states of the environment. In this work, we trained the trading agent using the Q-learning algorithm of Reinforcement Learning to find optimal dynamic trading strategies. We experimented with the two proposed models on real stock market data from the Indian and American stock markets. The proposed models outperformed the Buy-and-Hold and Decision-Tree based trading strategy in terms of profitability. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Algorithmic trading; Reinforcement Learning; Stock market","Commerce; Decision trees; Financial markets; Learning algorithms; Profitability; Reinforcement learning; Algorithmic trading; Automated trading; Current patterns; Optimal dynamics; Q-learning agents; Q-learning algorithms; Research problems; Trading strategies; Electronic trading",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85089542460

Then, after finding the similar time windows and predicting the market behavior of the next day, the optimum function along with the transaction cost is used in the portfolio optimization step in which, four algorithms including KMNLOG, KMDLOG, SPCLOG and HRCLOG are proposed for this purpose.

Despite the fact that the model's effectiveness in generating profits may depend on the particular trading strategy it is used with, these two components are often designed separately, in part because of the difficulty involved in jointly optimizing them. Motivated by this interplay between model performance and trading strategy, this work presents a novel automated trading architecture in which the prediction model is tuned to enhance profitability instead of accuracy, while the trading strategy attempts to be more sophisticated in its use of the model's price predictions. In particular, instead of acting simply on whether the price is predicted to rise or fall we show that there is value in taking advantage of the model-specific distribution of predicted returns, and the fact that a prediction's position within that distribution carries useful information about the expected profitability of a trade. Our proposed approach was tested with tree-based models as well as one deep long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks, all of which were kept structurally simple and generated predictions based on price observations over a modest number of trading days. Tested over the period 2010–2019 on the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), NASDAQ and Russell 2000 stock indices, and our best overall model achieved cumulative returns of 350%, 403%, 497% and 333%, respectively, outperforming the benchmark buy-and-hold strategy as well as other recent efforts. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Automatic trading; Deep learning; Finance; LSTM; Stock prediction","Commerce; Financial markets; Fintech; Forecasting; Predictive analytics; Profitability; Automated trading; Buy-and-hold strategy; Dow Jones Industrial averages; Model performance; Price prediction models; Specific distribution; Trading strategies; Tree-based model; Long short-term memory",Review,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85088902625

Using SPDR S&P 500 ETF datasets as a proxy for the market on regular volume trading days (November 3, 2016) and on high-volume trading days (November 9, 2016), we show that HFT, on average, has a disturbing action mainly on regular volume trading days, whereas on high-volume trading days, it appears to have a stabilizing effect by balancing both the volatility and bid-ask spread. That is, HFT as a whole has a more neutral impact on the market's volatility and bid-ask spread than the single aggressive and passive components.

The research is based on Bitcoin-USA dollar prices from the beginning of 2012 until the end of March 2020. Such a long period of time that includes volatile periods with strong up and downtrends introduces challenges to any forecasting system. We use particle swarm optimization to find the best forecasting combinations of setups. Results show that Bitcoin's price changes do not follow the ""Random Walk"" efficient market hypothesis and that both Darvas Box and Linear Regression techniques can help traders to predict the bitcoin's price trends. We also find that both methodologies work better predicting an uptrend than a downtrend. The best setup for the Darvas Box strategy is six days of formation. A Darvas box uptrend signal was found efficient predicting four sequential daily returns while a downtrend signal faded after two days on average. The best setup for the Linear Regression model is 42 days with 1 standard deviation. © 2020 by the authors.","Algorithmic trading; Bitcoin; Darvas box; Swarm optimizations",,Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85089497594

The market has latent factors that drive prices, and agents account for the permanent impact they have on prices. This leads to a large stochastic game, where each agents performance criteria are computed under a different probability measure. We analyze the mean-field game (MFG) limit of the stochastic game and show that the Nash equilibrium is given by the solution to a nonstandard vector-valued forward–backward stochastic differential equation. Under some mild assumptions, we construct the solution in terms of expectations of the filtered states.

We investigate empirically the comparative influence of high and low frequency traders on the price process, and conversely the influence of the price process on the trading of high and low frequency traders. We find that high frequency traders have a particularly high success rate on each transaction, measured by the likelihood that the following price change will go in their direction as well as by the amount of time they have to wait to realize their gain, when trading against low frequency traders. Contrary to common wisdom, we find that high frequency traders’ activity does not induce volatility or jumps. In fact, it is their absence that is problematic: volatility and jumps are more prevalent in periods when they trade less intensely. Conversely, we find that spikes in volatility and jumps cause high frequency traders to trade less intensely, decreasing their provision of liquidity. Finally, looking at the market microstructure noise component to the price model, we find that higher level of noise generates trading opportunities for high frequency traders and lead them to increase their trading activity. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","High frequency trading; Jumps; Liquidity; Market impact; Market microstructure noise; Price process; Volatility","Classification (of information); Electronic trading; Microstructure; High-frequency trading; Jumps; Liquidity; Market impacts; Market microstructure noise; Price process; Volatility; Commerce",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85076838499

In order to be first to trading opportunities, firms invest in the fastest hardware and the shortest connections between their machines and the markets. Yet this is not enough: algorithms must be short, no more than a few instructions. As a result there is a trade-off in the design of optimal high frequency trading strategies: being the fastest necessitates being less sophisticated. To understand the effect of this tension a computational model is presented that captures latency, both of code execution and information transmission. Trading algorithms are modelled through genetic programming with longer programmes allowing more sophisticated decisions at the cost of slower execution times. It is shown that, depending on the market composition, short fast strategies and slower more sophisticated strategies may both be viable and exploit different trading opportunities. The relative profits of these different approaches vary, however, slow traders benefit and social welfare increase in the presence of HFTs.

It is inspired on the idea that in the price fluctuations a restoring force to a supposed fair price, besides inertia and dissipation, could take place. The model is evaluated in an emerging market, which is of the Brazilian stock exchange BM&FBovespa (B3). The choice is due to the expectation that the model could perform better by exploiting deviations from the concept of efficient market. In such direction, the use of Hurst exponent to choose suitable assets to trade employing the model is discussed. A fairly common trading system endowed with the stop gain and stop loss limiting parameters was used to evaluate the model. To avoid excessive arbitrariness, those parameters were established after a study referred to the data itself in which a consistently defined relation return/risk is computed.

Design/methodology/approach: After showing that market power exists in the financial market, this paper centers around the question of how market power is constructed in the financial market. To sharpen the answer to the question, the paper compares the conditions needed for market power construction in the financial market with those needed in the goods market. The paper selects spoofing, the frequently used order-based tactic in high-frequency trading strategies, to analyze in detail how spoof orders can ignite herding with market power building as the essence. The Flash Crash that occurred in the New York Stock Exchange on May 6, 2010 provides an excellent case of market power construction exhibited in spoofing. Findings: The behavioral mechanism of market power construction in the case of spoofing is perception alignment. It becomes effective when two necessary conditions are met: the spoof trader takes advantage of the incomplete order display set up by the exchange; and the behavioral weaknesses exhibited by numerous individual investors. In addition to these key conditions, this paper finds other ones for market power to be created in the financial market. They are easier, quicker, more secret, more flexible and less risky relative to the conditions for market power building in the goods market. Practical implications: The detailed analysis points to the behavioral mechanism, i.e. perception alignment, and microstructural mechanism, i.e. incomplete order display, that could be responsive to regulation. Originality/value: The originality of the findings is to uncover the mechanism of spoofing in taking advantage of behavioral biases of individual investors. The value is to gain more complete understanding of the essence of herding caused by spoofing. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Behavioral weakness; Herding; High-frequency trading; Incomplete order display; Market power; Perception alignment; Spoofing",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85086591975

Rapid advances in technology have paved the way for the collection of unprecedented volumes of data. Currently, the slow speed of information dissemination, laggard accounting systems, and a focus on high levels of aggregation are perhaps the largest contributors to waning relevance of financial reporting. The fight for trading superiority is leading users to seek relevant data elsewhere and may contribute to these observed effects. This paper proposes an accounting system known as User XBRL (U-XBRL) designed to overcome these issues. This system collects, analyzes, and displays information in such a way that caters to the speed, detail, and customization demands of modern-day stakeholders (Krahel and Titera, 2015).

Although some consider HFT to be inherently bad, others view it as providing important liquidity to markets. Thus, the question regarding HFT's impact on market quality remains open. To address this, the authors conducted two sets of controlled laboratory experiments, one with and one without an HFT robot trader. The authors focus on two aspects of HFT trading strategies that have the potential to affect market quality negatively: arbitrage and directional trading. Indeed the authors designed the HFT robot to have a perfect view of the market before executing a trade to provide it the best chance to influence the market. The introduction of this HFT robot had a significant positive impact on trading volume and bid depth, but it had a negligible impact on other market quality indicators such as efficiency, price volatility, bid-ask spread, and book depth. Thus, the authors find that in this polar case, HFT is neither a drain on nor a boost to market quality, suggesting that HFT trading, in its worst case, has a benign effect on the market.

We demonstrate that, across securities, the liquidity offered by high frequency traders is significantly less diverse than that of traditional traders; this finding is in line with the cross-asset learning hypothesis. The excessive co-movement in liquidity is also partly explained by common market making rules. In periods of increased market stress, we find HFT, designated market making, and order size to be important sources of liquidity commonality.

We ask about detectable results of both uncertainty and complexity at the aggregated market level. We analyzed almost one billion trades of eight currency pairs (2007-2017) and show that increased algorithmic trading is associated with more complex subsequences and more predictable structures in bid-ask spreads. However, algorithmic involvement is also associated with more future uncertainty, which seems contradictory, at first sight. On the micro-level, traders employ algorithms to reduce their local uncertainty by creating more complex algorithmic patterns. This entails more predictable structure and more complexity. On the macro-level, the increased overall complexity implies more combinatorial possibilities, and therefore, more uncertainty about the future. The chain rule of entropy reveals that uncertainty has been reduced when trading on the level of the fourth digit behind the dollar, while new uncertainty started to arise at the fifth digit behind the dollar (aka 'pip-trading'). In short, our information theoretic analysis helps us to clarify that the seeming contradiction between decreased uncertainty on the micro-level and increased uncertainty on the macro-level is the result of the inherent relationship between complexity and uncertainty. © 2020 by the authors.","Algorithmic trading; Complexity; Dynamical systems theory; Machine learning; Predictability",,Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85085090524

These digital currencies have garnered significant interest from investment banks and portfolio managers as a potential option to diversify the financial risk from investing in other assets. This interest has also extended to the general public who have seen cryptocurrencies as a way of making a quick profit. This paper provides a first insight into the applicability of high frequency momentum trading strategies for cryptocurrencies. We implemented two variations of a signal-based momentum trading strategy: (i) a time series method; (ii) a cross sectional method. These strategies were tested on a selection of seven of the largest cryptocurrencies ranked by market capitalization. The results show that there exists potential for the momentum strategy to be used successfully for cryptocurrency trading in a high frequency setting. A comparison with a passive portfolio strategy is proposed, which shows abnormal returns when compared with the momentum strategies. Furthermore, the robustness of our results are checked through the application of the momentum strategies other sample periods. We also compare the performances of the signal-based momentum strategies with returns-based versions of the strategies. It is shown that the signal-based strategy outperforms the returns-based strategy. However, there appears to be no single parameterization of the signal-based strategies that can generate the greatest cumulative return over all sample periods. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Bitcoin; Exponential moving averages; Momentum strategy; Passive strategy; Trading strategies",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85078722017

In the stock market, the daily trading activities of stocks are carried out at different frequencies and cycles, resulting in a multi-frequency trading mode of stocks , which provides useful clues for future price trends: short-term stock forecasting relies on high-frequency trading data, while long-term forecasting pays more attention to low-frequency data. In addition, stock series have strong volatility and nonlinearity, so stock forecasting is very challenging. In order to explore the multi-frequency mode of the stock , this paper proposes an adaptive wavelet transform model (AWTM). AWTM integrates the advantages of XGboost algorithm, wavelet transform, LSTM and adaptive layer in feature selection, time–frequency decomposition, data prediction and dynamic weighting. More importantly, AWTM can automatically focus on different frequency components according to the dynamic evolution of the input sequence, solving the difficult problem of stock prediction. This paper verifies the performance of the model using S&P500 stock dataset. Compared with other advanced models, real market data experiments show that AWTM has higher prediction accuracy and less hysteresis. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Adaptive; Long short-term memory; Stock price prediction; Wavelet transform","Commerce; Financial markets; Forecasting; Long short-term memory; Wavelet decomposition; Wavelet transforms; Adaptive; Adaptive wavelet transforms; Different frequency; Frequency decomposition; High-frequency trading; Long-term forecasting; Prediction accuracy; Stock price prediction; Electronic trading",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85074506729

The price reversal phenomenon is gaining importance rapidly due to the increasingly intensive use of IT/Fintech-based trading automation facilities on the Indonesia Stock Exchange. However, one knows little about how their trading affects volatility and liquidity pressures that cause price reversals. A new research approach uses the factors of market microstructure mechanism based on high-frequency data (HFD-intraday). The research method uses purposive random sampling, which classified price fractions into three groups, specifically low price, medium price, and high price, which are analyzed by logistic panel regression. The research variables used include price reversal (dependent), stock return, trading volume, transaction frequency, volume/ frequency (V/F) proxy, volatility, and liquidity. According to low price model research findings, all variables show a significant effect on price reversal; for medium price model, all variables except liquidity show a significant effect on price reversal; and for high price model, all variables have a significant effect on price reversal, except trading volume and volatility. In conclusion, low price shares tend to have higher price reversal probability compared to continuity because they tend to be liquid, low institutional ownership, and minimal reporting/analysis and are controlled by HFTs (uninformed traders). Some variables are not significant because of the bounce effect around the bid-ask spread. © Perdana Wahyu Santosa, 2020.","High-frequency trading; Market microstructure; Price reversal",,Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85082314491

The intensities of the orders she receives depend not only on the spreads she quotes but also on unobservable factors modelled by a hidden Markov chain. We tackle this stochastic control problem under partial information with a model that unifies and generalizes many existing ones under full information, combining several risk metrics and constraints, and using general decreasing intensity functionals. We use stochastic filtering, control and piecewise-deterministic Markov processes theory, to reduce the dimensionality of the problem and characterize the reduced value function as the unique continuous viscosity solution of its dynamic programming equation. We then solve the analogous full information problem and compare the results numerically through a concrete example. We show that the optimal full information spreads are biased when the exact market regime is unknown, and the market maker needs to adjust for additional regime uncertainty in terms of P&L sensitivity and observed order flow volatility. This effect becomes higher, the longer the waiting time in between orders. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","algorithmic trading; hidden Markov model; high-frequency trading; Market making; piecewise-deterministic Markov processes; stochastic filtering; stochastic optimal control; viscosity solutions",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85084829249

The strategy employs, in addition to sell limit orders (LOs) and sell market orders (MOs), a large number of spoof buy LOs to manipulate the volume imbalance of the LOB. Spoofing is illegal, so the strategy trades off the gains that originate from spoofing against the expected financial losses due to a fine imposed by the financial authorities. As the fine increases, the investor relies less on spoofing, and if the fine is large, the investor does not spoof the LOB. The arrival rate of buy MOs increases because other traders interpret the spoofed buy-heavy LOB as an upward pressure on prices. When the fine is low, spoofing considerably increases the revenues from liquidating a position. Spoofing increases the PnL because (i) the investor employs fewer MOs to draw the inventory to zero and benefits from roundtrip trades, which stem from spoof buy LOs that are ‘inadvertently’ filled and subsequently unwound with sell LOs; and (ii) the midprice trends upward when the book is buy-heavy; therefore the spoofer sells the asset at better prices. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","execution; high-frequency trading; layering; Market making; market quality; spoofing",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85079721697

Besides, the supervised deep learning and reinforcement learning are jointly and iteratively trained to make full use of the supervised signals in the training data, and obtain more update information and stricter loss function constraints, thereby increasing investment returns.

With the rise of technologies such as big data and artificial intelligence in recent years, agent-based modeling and basic supporting technologies in the field of FinTech are deeply integrated to jointly promote continuous breakthroughs in FinTech. In particular, in the fields of big data ontology research, agent-based model calibration, investor behavior modeling, regulatory technology applications, etc., agent-based modeling has demonstrated its unique advantages in integrating with FinTech. From the perspectives of big data ontology, agent-based modeling is an effective method that uses financial big data ontology modeling to depict the correlation between financial entities and to study their causal relationships. From the perspectives of artificial intelligence, it provides the basis for fine modeling of individuals and behavioral evolution modeling, and agent-based modeling provides a new research frame-work for algorithmic trading. From the perspectives of regulatory technology, the agent-based model in the development process to promote the formation of a new 'scenario-response' type of risk management, thus providing supports for the 'regulatory technology' development.

However, their ability to use services such as cloud computing, VoIP, media streaming, high-frequency trading, network gaming, video conferencing and telemedicine, are sensitive to the network quality of service (QoS). We examine the effects of pro-competition regulation on Internet QoS - a measure of digital divide - using 23 indicators of competition from a panel of 160 countries covering 2008–2016. We find that pro-competition regulations had a stronger positive effect on QoS in developed countries compared to developing ones. A one-point increase in the pro-competition score increases QoS, measured as average connection speed, by at least 200 kbps in developed countries. Our results control for supply and demand factors, as well as country-fixed effects. The results are also robust to different measures of average connection speed. We attribute this variation to difficulties in the contracting environment in developed and developing countries, consistent with Levy and Spiller (1996). Countries with better institutional endowments – associated with developed economies - are better able to design and enforce complex regulatory contracts compared to developing countries. Ironically, this means that more pro-competition rules on paper will not necessarily narrow the digital divide between developed and developing countries and that there is a need to consider minimum quality standards as a means to effect improved Internet QoS. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Competition; Digital divide; Internet; Quality of service; Regulation","Competition; Developing countries; Distributed computer systems; Economics; Electronic trading; Internet; Media streaming; Telecommunication services; Video conferencing; Developed countries; Developed economies; Digital divide; High-frequency trading; Institutional endowment; Network quality of services; Regulation; Supply and demand; Quality of service",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85068576544

In this context, the limit orders, market orders, and cancel orders arrivals in the order book are modeled as point processes with intensities that only depend on the state of the order book. These are high-dimensional models which are realistic from a micro-structure point of view and have been recently developed in the literature. In this context, we consider a market maker who stands ready to buy and sell stock on a regular and continuous basis at a publicly quoted price, and identifies the strategies that maximize their P&L penalized by their inventory. An extension of the methodology is proposed to solve market-making problems where the orders arrivals are modeled using Hawkes processes with exponential kernel. We apply the theory of Markov Decision Processes and dynamic programming method to characterize analytically the solutions to our optimal market-making problem. The second part of the paper deals with the numerical aspect of the high-dimensional trading problem. We use a control randomization method combined with quantization method to compute the optimal strategies. Several computational tests are performed on simulated data to illustrate the efficiency of the computed optimal strategy. In particular, we simulated an order book with constant/ symmetric/ asymmetrical/ state dependent intensities, and compared the computed optimal strategy with naive strategies.

Using the CME’s limit-order-book data and a heteroscedasticity-based identification approach, we find more intensive algorithmic quoting (AQ) is beneficial to multiple dimensions of market quality. AQ improves pricing efficiency and mitigates short-term volatility, but its effects on liquidity costs are somewhat mixed. Increased AQ significantly narrows effective spreads in the corn and soybean markets, but not in the less traded live cattle futures market. The narrowing in effective spreads emerges from a reduction in adverse selection costs as more informed traders lose their market advantage. There also is evidence that liquidity provider revenues increase with heightened AQ activity in the corn futures market, albeit the effect is not statistically significant in the soybean and live cattle futures markets. The increased revenue points to a tradeoff between the dimensions of market quality, and the need for continued assessment and monitoring of algorithmic trading activity. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Algorithmic trading; commodity futures; identification through heteroscedasticity; market quality","agricultural market; agricultural trade; algorithm; cattle; commodity market; maize; soybean; Bos; Glycine max; Zea mays",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85088237892

Unlike in the risk-neutral case, the optimal inventories become mean-reverting and vanish as the number of trading rounds becomes large. In contrast, the HFTs' risk-adjusted profits and the equilibrium price impact converge to their risk-neutral counterparts.

The spread of machine learning in finance challenges existing practices of modelling and model use and creates a demand for practical solutions for how to manage the complexity pertaining to these techniques. Drawing on interviews with quants applying machine learning techniques to financial problems, the article examines how these people manage model complexity in the process of devising machine learning-powered trading algorithms. The analysis shows that machine learning quants use Ockham’s razor – things should not be multiplied without necessity – as a heuristic tool to prevent excess model complexity and secure a certain level of human control and interpretability in the modelling process. I argue that understanding the way quants handle the complexity of learning models is a key to grasping the transformation of the human’s role in contemporary data and model-driven finance.

In real-world financial markets, speed is known to heavily influence the design of automated trading algorithms, with the generally accepted wisdom that faster is better. Here, we introduce increasingly realistic models of trading speed and profile the computation times of a suite of eminent trading algorithms from the literature. Results demonstrate that: (a) trading performance is impacted by speed, but faster is not always better; (b) the Adaptive-Aggressive (AA) algorithm, until recently considered the most dominant trading strategy in the literature, is outperformed by the simplistic Shaver (SHVR) strategy—shave one tick off the current best bid or ask—when relative computation times are accurately simulated.

The implication of trading pairs, following statistical analysis, is to buy the underpriced asset while short selling the overpriced. The predicted price relationship is determined through analysis of historical spread data between the members of the corresponding pair. The investor expects the price difference, in an efficient market, should converge and stocks return to their 'fair value', where the positions are closed and profit is realized.

Widespread classical 'crisp' technique is chosen, utilized and compared with the developed 'fuzzy' model throughout the paper. In order to further improve this contribution, the expert opinions extracted from the Bloomberg database are also integrated into the fuzzy decision-making process.

Focusing on the high frequency trading (HFT) industry, it analyses a series of interviews with HFT employees (managers, computer programmers and traders). It shows that regulations and firm rules profoundly affect HFT practices. However, they do not provide employees with answers for their ethical questions. To judge the ethicality of HFT, employees choose reference stakeholder groups and assess the way HFT impacts them. The perception that HFT has a positive effect on stakeholder groups is associated with moral satisfaction, whereas the perception that it has a negative effect is related to emotional detachment, sense of meaninglessness and turnover intent. The high variance in employees’ choices of stakeholder reference groups emphasizes the subjectivity and uncertainty that HFT ethicality entails. Therefore, this study suggests that the financial industry may lack moral leadership.

This has produced highly competitive and fragmented financial markets. It is in this market environment that the ultra-fast segment of high-frequency trading (HFT) has materialised. European regulators have addressed the potential adverse market impact of HFT in terms of increased systemic risk (e.g. 'flash crashes') and market abuse through provisions in MiFID II and in the MAR. But there is also an additional concern that so far has received less regulatory attention-the question of whether HFT is fair. This article explores whether and how HFT raises fairness-related concerns against the backdrop of the overarching policy goal of maintaining confidence in the financial markets. Finding that HFT does indeed raise such concerns, it then asks whether the newly instituted provisions on algorithmic trading and HFT in MiFID II and MAR do anything to alleviate this problem. The answer is to a certain extent yes. However, significant concerns remain unaddressed by the new regulatory context. The article suggests other provisions in MiFID II that in the author's view should be assessed with a view to target fairness-related concerns raised by HFT. © 2020 Kluwer Law International BV, The Netherlands.","Algorithmic trading; Conflict of interest; Fairness; High-frequency trading; Market confidence; Market integrity; Market microstructure; MiFID II; Systemic risk; Unfair market practices",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85081066567

The momentum in the midprice of the asset depends on the execution of liquidity taking orders and the arrival of news. Buy market orders (MOs) exert a short-lived upward pressure on the midprice, whereas sell MOs exert a short-lived downward pressure on the midprice. We employ Nasdaq high-frequency data to estimate model parameters and to illustrate the performance of the market making strategy. The market maker employs the alpha signal to minimise adverse selection costs, execute directional trades in anticipation of price changes, and to manage inventory risk. As the market maker increases their tolerance to inventory risk, the expected profits that stem from the alpha signal increase because the strategy employs more speculative MOs and performs more roundtrip trades with limit orders. © 2020 World Scientific Publishing Company.","adverse selection; alpha signal; high-frequency trading; latent alpha; Market making; momentum trading; order flow",,Article,"Article in Press",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85085685206

Following an approximation of the optimization problem, we calculate an optimal solution for the trading speed in the space of linear functions on a truncation of the signature of the price process. We provide strong numerical evidence illustrating the accuracy and flexibility of the approach.

The authors conclude that the Eurasian Economic Union is the major integration project bringing together Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Russia. This research addresses various legal issues related to founding of the EAEU single financial services market with provisions and annexes of the EAEU Treaty studied. The EAEU meets challenges and creates legal and institutional framework for single financial services market within a relatively short timeframe. By 2025 both Supranational Eurasian financial regulator should be established and EAEU legislation on financial services should be harmonized. These tasks require international and national regulation experience. Therefore through the use of comparative analysis some advantages of the European Union law in the field of financial services market regulation are pointed out alongside with particular national legislation aspects of the EAEU member states in the similar or relative fields. Comparative analysis provides for determination of modern approaches to financial services market regulation in the EAEU and its member states, and allows to emphasize advantages and disadvantages of such regulation. Comparative analysis is applied to specifically investigate three subject areas of high relevance for global financial community: institutional forms of trade in financial instruments; organized trade in financial derivatives; organization of algorithmic and high-frequency algorithmic trading. Conclusion drawn is that the EU experience in the matters of financial markets regulation is of particular interest for the EAEU and its member states. © 2020, Supporting Academic Initiatives Foundation.

Asymmetric information influences stock prices with varying degree of investors’ perception. Estimation of asymmetric information cost and its determinants have been explored significantly under low-frequency trading. The literature hardly attempts to study asymmetric information cost under high-frequency trading (HFT). Asymmetric information cost significantly influences bid-ask spread, and hence the nature of its impact under different market conditions needs to be analyzed under HFT. The study attempts to estimate asymmetric information cost in HFT and analyze its determinants under different industry sectors and market conditions. The study followed Affleck-Graves et al. (1994, The Journal of Finance, 49(4), 1471–1488) model to estimate the asymmetric information cost using 5 minutes interval data for a period of 82 trading days. Information gets reflected in equity through the movement in price, variation in trading volume, and return volatility. The study has found share price, traded volume, return volatility and trading frequency as the major determinants of asymmetric information cost in different market conditions.

These include properties related to returns (leptokurtosis, absence of linear autocorrelation, volatility clustering), trading volumes (volume clustering, correlation between volume and volatility), and timing of trades (number of price changes, autocorrelation of durations between subsequent trades, heavy tails in their distribution, order-side clustering). Our model combines heterogeneous boundedly rational agents, endogenously activating on the basis of market events, with realistic assumptions on market microstructure. In particular, we introduce a strict event scheduling borrowed from the EURONEXT exchange. We study the model in a bottom-up fashion under alternative scenarios regarding the sophistication of agents’ strategies. These scenarios allow us to disentangle the role of microstructure characteristics from trading behaviour in the emergence of market statistical properties. Our results reveal that traders’ endogenous activation is crucial to jointly reproduce most of these properties.

Prompted by concerns that HFTs reap unfair advantages over other traders by using super-fast trading technologies, some regulatory proposals aim to curb HFTs’ ultra-low-latency activities. However, research suggests that HFTs also play beneficial roles in financial markets, including liquidity provision as voluntary market makers. Currently, little is known about their role in incorporating firm-specific fundamental information into prices. Employing a novel dataset that identifies trades by HFTs and non-HFTs, we find that earnings response coefficients are larger and abnormal price impact of trades are lower when HFTs trade more following earnings announcements, suggesting that HFTs facilitate efficient assimilation of earnings news. HFTs also enhance the forecasting capabilities of financial analysts. Furthermore, HFT participation increases return synchronicity around earnings announcements when multiple firms in the same industry announce earnings on the same day. The evidence suggests that HFTs help incorporate relevant industry information, and this effect arises from HFTs’ liquidity supplying function. We address the endogenous preference of HFTs for large and liquid stocks by including multiple controls for firm size and liquidity, implementing abnormal or change specification for the price impact tests, and performing pre-treatment placebo tests for all of our analyses. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Analyst forecast; Earnings announcements; Earnings response coefficient; High frequency trading; Price impact of trades",,Article,"Article in Press",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85087713434

The theoretical part introduces a set of equations and presents an Agent Based Model implemented via a computer-based simulation. The wide spread leads to the appearance of unusual phenomena caused by the relative speed difference between the fast and slow traders. The latter agents tend to quote limit orders that look irrational, as they are distant more than one tick from the top-of-book. The same relative speed difference causes slow traders to post market orders that execute at price worse than originally intended. Both these abnormal orders tend to increase local volatility. Other results found by the simulation are an increase in global volatility (computed both as the difference of maximum less minimum price and as standard deviation of price distribution) and in volatility at sub-second timescales. These occurrences penalise slower traders and affect market stability. All the results are consistent both under quiet and stressed market conditions.

More precisely, when volatility is modeled using a classical stochastic volatility model—e.g. the Heston model—the problem faced by an option market maker is characterized by a low-dimensional functional equation that can be solved numerically using a Euler scheme along with interpolation techniques, even for large portfolios.

While it is intuitively obvious and straightforward to prove that in the presence of sufficiently high transaction costs, buy and hold is the better strategy, is it possible that with no transaction costs, buy and hold can still be the better strategy When there is no delay in trade execution, we prove a theorem saying that the answer is no. However, when a delay is present, our simulation results using a binary lattice stock model indicate that the answer can be yes.

To tackle this problem, two completely opposite approaches, namely technical and fundamental analysis, emerged. Technical analysis bases its predictions on mathematical indicators constructed on the stocks price, while fundamental analysis exploits the information retrieved from news, profitability, and macroeconomic factors. The competition between these schools of thought has led to many interesting achievements, however, to date, no satisfactory solution has been found. Our work aims to combine both technical and fundamental analysis through the application of data science and machine learning techniques. In this paper, the stock market prediction problem is mapped in a classification task of time series data. Indicators of technical analysis and the sentiment of news articles are both exploited as input. The outcome is a robust predictive model able to forecast the trend of a portfolio composed by the twenty most capitalized companies listed in the NASDAQ100 index. As a proof of real effectiveness of our approach, we exploit the predictions to run a high frequency trading simulation reaching more than 80% of annualized return.

At the same time, correctly identifying these imaginary lines is one of the greatest challenges that they constantly face due to the complex and mostly inconsistent nature of this phenomenon. Still, these lines are considered among one of the most important technical indicators for designating buy-sell points. It is very difficult, if not impossible to determine the best support-resistance lines for any given stock; hence most of the time, the traders manually draw these imaginary lines on stock charts and implement their trading strategies accordingly. In this study, our aim is automatically identifying these lines through an evolutionary optimization algorithm (PSO) and using these support-resistance points for deciding the optimum buy-sell points. The proposed strategy is compared against Buy Hold. The results indicate using optimized support-resistance lines can be used for identifying buy-sell points, meanwhile if we only decide to use these automatically-generated lines, no significant improvement was observed when compared to Buy Hold strategy. However, this is a preliminary study and more analyses need to be performed. If the model is used as one of the multiple inputs to a more comprehensive trading system along with other technical/fundamental indicators, better results might be achieved. © 2019 IEEE.","algorithmic trading; evolutionary algorithms (EA); particle swarm optimization (PSO); Stock market; support-resistance; technical analysis; technical indicators","Commerce; Financial markets; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Sales; Software engineering; Algorithmic trading; Algorithmic trading system; Automatically generated; Evolutionary optimization algorithm; Support resistance; Technical analysis; Technical indicator; Trading strategies; Electronic trading",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85079231482

Given the prevalence of structural change in financial time series, that implies that the rules might have to be updated at predefined time intervals. We introduce an alternative solution based on an ensemble of models which are trained using a sliding window. The structure of the ensemble combines the flexibility required to adapt to structural changes with the need to control for the excessive transaction costs associated with over-trading. The performance of the algorithm is benchmarked against five different comparable strategies that include the traditional static approach, the generation of trading rules that are used for single time period and are subsequently discarded, and three alternatives based on ensembles with different voting schemes. The experimental results, based on market data, show that the suggested approach offers very competitive results against comparable solutions and highlight the importance of containing transaction costs. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Ensembles; Finance; Grammatical evolution; Trading","Commerce; Computational grammars; Finance; Financial data processing; Algorithmic trading; Alternative solutions; Ensemble of models; Ensembles; Financial time series; Grammatical evolution; Trading; Transaction cost; Costs",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85071367323

A neural network-based agent is proposed to learn the temporal pattern in data and automatically trades according to the current market condition and the historical data. We propose two techniques: Action shaping and advantage function shaping, to improve the total profit. The action shaping is used to avoid the agent outputting illegal actions since we assume that the agent trades fixed position sizes in a single security. The advantage function shaping is proposed to increase the probability of actions that lead to more profit. The proposed system has been back-tested on the currency market.

This gives us important insights into a class of market participant who has come to be very influential in present markets. Design/methodology/approach: The authors use the weekly natural gas (NG) storage report for the test because the information contained in the release often has a large effect on prices. Moreover, the NG market is heavily traded and liquid, and prone to high volatility. These factors make trading in this market attractive to HFT. The authors test for the profitability of those who trade in the first milliseconds after the report’s release; and for information leakage prior to the report. Findings: The authors find those who trade within the first 50 ms accurately incorporate the information contained in the storage report into prices, and earn the majority of profits. In fact, HFT profits are decreasing in the time it takes them to trade after the announcement (measured to 200 ms). Further tests find no evidence of informed trading prior to the release of the report, and so the HFT reaction to the report incorporates the information contained therein into prices. Originality/value: This is one of the few analyzes of the profitability of liquidity-taking HFT, and the only analysis that uses millisecond NG data.

In this article we introduce a model considering different trading styles to satisfy the predictive near-term customer demand of market liquidity in order to find an optimal order submission strategy based on different market situations.

HFT strategies have reached considerable volumes of commercial traffic, so much so that it is estimated that they are responsible for most of the transaction traffic of some stock exchanges, with percentages that, in some cases, exceed 70% of the total. One of the main issues of the HFT systems is the prediction of the medium-short term trend. For this reason, many algorithms have been proposed in literature. The author proposes in this work the use of an algorithm based both on supervised Deep Learning and on a Reinforcement Learning algorithm for forecasting the short-term trend in the currency FOREX (FOReign EXchange) market to maximize the return on investment in an HFT algorithm. With an average accuracy of about 85%, the proposed algorithm is able to predict the medium-short term trend of a currency cross based on the historical trend of this and by means of correlation data with other currency crosses using techniques known in the financial field with the term arbitrage. The final part of the proposed pipeline includes a grid trading engine which, based on the aforementioned trend predictions, will perform high frequency operations in order to maximize profit and minimize drawdown. The trading system has been validated over several financial years and on the EUR/USD cross confirming the high performance in terms of Return of Investment (98.23%) in addition to a reduced drawdown (15.97 %) which confirms its financial sustainability. © 2019 by the authors.","Deep learning; Financial; LSTM; Reinforcement learning; STM32",,Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85074153157

A lot of research is going on to harness its full potential in many fronts from small to large financial businesses. Currently, the Collateral Smart Contract Services (CSCS) are manually processed in financial institutions. The main objective of this research is to help financial institutions in choosing the most appropriate financial instrument for CSCS and allow its automated trading using blockchain technology, which we have achieved on one of the prominent blockchain platforms. We have designed a Chaincode for CSCS using Hyperledger Fabric, maintaining a transparent distributed ledger for the CSCS between financial institutions. The clients in the network are permissioned and possess certificates that they utilize to interact with the Hyperledger Fabric network. Go programming language has been used to create contracts on Hyperledger Fabric. One of the main challenges in the implementation has been to identify different elements that are required to get the network and chaincode running on the Hyperledger. We have designed a network consisting of multiple organizations each one connecting with other organizations for the Hyperledger transactions, for achieving collateral services among these institutions. The experimental evaluation criteria designed for this study could be used as formal procedure for designing financial smart contracts on Hyperledger. © 2019 IEEE.","Blockchain; Collateral Smart Contract Services; Financial Smart Contract; Go; Hyperledger","Blockchain; Contracts; Design; Mobile telecommunication systems; Automated trading; Contract services; Design and implementations; Experimental evaluation; Financial institution; Hyperledger; Intermediary services; Multiple organizations; Finance",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85077961095

A market maker is in charge of adjusting prices (on a fast scale) and of setting closing prices and transaction costs on a daily basis, controlling for the volatility of returns and market activity. We first show that a baseline version of the model with no frictions is able to generate returns endowed with several stylized facts. This achievement suggests that the two time scales used in the model are one (possibly novel) way to obtain realistic market outcomes and that high-frequency trading can amplify liquidity shocks. We then explore whether transaction costs can be used to control excess volatility and improve market quality. While properly implemented taxation schemes may help in reducing volatility, care is needed to avoid excessively curbing activity in the market and intensifying the occurrence of abnormal peaks in returns. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Artificial markets; High-frequency trading; Liquidity shocks; Transaction costs",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85055994913

Rich event matching semantics determine how to compose events into trends. The expressive power of state-of-the-art streaming systems remains limited since they do not support many of these semantics. Worse yet, they suffer from long delays and high memory costs because they maintain aggregates at a fine granularity. To overcome these limitations, our Coarse-Grained Event Trend Aggregation (Cogra) approach supports a rich variety of event matching semantics within one system. Better yet, Cogra incrementally maintains aggregates at the coarsest granularity possible for each of these semantics. In this way, Cogra minimizes the number of aggregates - reducing both time and space complexity. Our experiments demonstrate that Cogra achieves up to six orders of magnitude speed-up and up to seven orders of magnitude memory reduction compared to state-of-the-art approaches. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.","Complex Event Processing; Event trend; Incremental aggregation; Query optimization","Aggregates; Pattern matching; Algorithmic trading; Complex event processing; Event trend; Orders of magnitude; Query optimization; State-of-the-art approach; Streaming applications; Time and space complexity; Semantics",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85069475058

The proposed method is estimation based and trading actions are carried out after estimating the forward conditional probability distribution. The main idea is to introduce special encoding schemes on the observed prices in order to obtain an efficient estimation of the forward conditional probability distribution performed by a feedforward neural network. Based on these estimations, a trading signal is launched if the probability of price change becomes significant which is measured by a quadratic criterion. The performance analysis of our method tested on historical time series (NASDAQ/NYSE stocks) has demonstrated that the algorithm is profitable. As far as high frequency trading is concerned, the algorithm lends itself to GPU implementation, which can considerably increase its performance when time frames become shorter and the computational time tends to be the critical aspect of the algorithm. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Algorithmic trading; Estimation; Neural networks; Non-linear regression",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85021896606

These architectures are capable of modeling and predicting vector autoregressive VAR(p) time series. In order to avoid overfitting, the input is pre-processed by independent component analysis to filter out the most noise like component. In this way, the accuracy of the prediction and the trading performance is increased. The proposed algorithms have a small number of free parameters which makes fast learning and trading possible. The method is not only tested on single asset price series, but also on predicting the value of mean reverting portfolios obtained by maximizing the predictability parameter of VAR(1) processes. The tests were first performed on artificially generated data and then on real data selected from exchange traded fund time series including bid–ask spread.

Specifically, the algorithm efficiently determines the optimal non-linear mapping and the corresponding lead–lag structure between two time series. Afterwards, this study explores the use of optimal causal paths as a means for identifying promising stock pairs and for generating buy and sell signals. For this purpose, the established trading strategy exploits information about the leading stock to predict future returns of the following stock. The value-add of the proposed framework is assessed by benchmarking it with variants relying on classic similarity measures and a buy-and-hold investment in the S&P 500 index. In the empirical back-testing study, the trading algorithm generates statistically and economically significant returns of 54.98% p.a. and an annualized Sharpe ratio of 3.57 after transaction costs. Returns are well superior to the benchmark approaches and do not load on any common sources of systematic risk. The strategy outperforms in the context of cryptocurrencies even in recent times due to the fact that stock returns contain substantial information about the future bitcoin returns. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Cryptocurrency; Finance; High-frequency trading; Lead–lag structure; Optimal causal path; Statistical arbitrage",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85057452524

The bid-ask spread increases as the MRT increases because market makers (MMs) increase the depth of their LOs to protect them from being picked off by other traders. We also show that the expected profits of the MMs increase when the MRT increases. The intuition is as follows. As the MRT increases, there are two opposing forces at work. One, the longer the MRT, the more likely the LOs are to be filled and, on average, shares are sold at a loss. Two, because the depth of the posted LOs increases, the probability that the LO is picked off by other traders before the end of the MRT decreases. The net effect is that a longer MRT leads to a higher expected profit. We also show that the depth of LOs increases when the volatility of the price of the asset increases. Also, the depth of LOs increases when the arrival rate of market orders increases because it is less likely that LOs will be picked off by the end of the MRT. Finally, our model also makes predictions about the overall liquidity of the market. We show that MMs choose to supply the minimum amount of shares per LO allowed by the exchange because expected profits are maximised when liquidity provided is lowest. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","High-frequency trading; Market making; Market quality; Minimum resting times; Regulation",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85060190315

Basically, a grid trading strategy is a method that seeks to make profit on the market movements of the underlying financial instrument by positioning buy and sell orders properly time-spaced (grid distance). The main advantage of the grid trading strategy is the financial sustainability of the algorithm because it provides a robust way to mediate losses in financial transactions even though this also means very complicated trades management algorithm. For these reasons, grid trading is certainly one of the best approaches to be used in high frequency trading (HFT) strategies. Due to the high level of unpredictability of the financial markets, many investment funds and institutional traders are opting for the HFT (high frequency trading) systems, which allow them to obtain high performance due to the large number of financial transactions executed in the short-term timeframe. The combination of HFT strategies with the use of machine learning methods for the financial time series forecast, has significantly improved the capability and overall performance of the modern automated trading systems. Taking this into account, the authors propose an automatic HFT grid trading system that operates in the FOREX (foreign exchange) market. The performance of the proposed algorithm together with the reduced drawdown confirmed the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approach. © 2019 by the authors.","Data forecasting; Financial time-series; Machine learning",,Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85067188222

Most existing algorithms use time series as input. Instead of relying on physical time, Directional Changes (DC) focus on the price reversion events where the reversion reaches a certain magnitude, which is referred to as the threshold. In this paper, we propose two trading algorithms based on DC - TA1 and TA2. TA1 is also based on the Average Overshoot Length scaling law (AOL). An Overshoot refers to the event of price continuing to change in the current direction before the next reversion takes place. The AOL states that on average the Overshoot length is approximately equal to the threshold of DC. We have designed two DC based trading algorithms: TA1 takes advantage of the AOL and T2 takes profit with a more conservative criteria. By testing the algorithms with five stock market indices, the results suggest that in most scenarios, the algorithms are able to generate a positive outcome. The input arguments can be changed in order to change the performance of the algorithms, so TA1 and TA2 could be tailored to trade in different markets. © 2019 IEEE.","AOL scaling law; Directional Changes; trading algorithms","Artificial intelligence; Commerce; Financial markets; Algorithm trading; Current direction; Directional changes; Length scaling; Physical time; Stock market index; Electronic trading",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85070731148

In this paper, we apply higher-order Factorization Machines, for which efficient training algorithms have only been available since 2016. As Factorization Machines require hyperparameters to be specified, we also introduce a novel adaptive-order algorithm for automatically determining them.

There are various strategies for investment, ranging from the buy-and-hold strategy that let time makes money to high-frequency trading based on complicated models of machine learning. For the general public, the candlestick analysis is a simple and straightforward way to predict the market trend and help make decisions on buy and sell. However, the general effectiveness and validity of such methodology are understudied, and many previous guidebooks on candlestick analysis were based on specific cases and the summary of prior experiences, but lack unbiased and rigorous confirmation. Here, we aim at evaluating the effectiveness of multiple famous candlestick patterns based on recent data of 20 U.S. stocks. By estimating the fraction of correct guesses and expected return, we were able to show that three of the four patterns under scrutiny were not effective in generating profitable outcomes, but one of them do provide valuable information on market trend reversal. Although testing more candlestick patterns and using more test data may lead to the discoveries of more patterns being significantly profitable, our results call for scrutiny and scientific guidance for the general public when applying the candlestick analysis, and questions the general validity and applicability of such analyses. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.","Candlestick; Stock price; Technical analysis; Trading strategy","Commerce; Data handling; Electronic trading; Financial markets; Forecasting; Information analysis; Learning systems; Profitability; Buy-and-hold strategy; Candlestick; Expected return; High-frequency trading; Prior experience; Stock price; Technical analysis; Trading strategies; Investments",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85064932211

The limitations of traditional portfolio theory are overcome using a multi-period definition of the problem. The model allows the inclusion of dynamic restrictions like transaction costs, portfolio unbalance, and inflation. A Monte Carlo method is proposed to handle these types of restrictions. The investment strategies method is introduced to make trading decisions based on the investor’s preference and the current state of the market. Preference is determined using heuristics instead of theoretical utility functions. The method was tested using real data from the Mexican market. The method was compared against buy-and-holds and single-period portfolios for metrics like the maximum loss, expected return, risk, the Sharpe’s ratio, and others. The results indicate investment strategies perform trading with less risk than other methods. Single-period methods attained the lowest performance in the experiments due to their high transaction costs. The conclusion was investment decisions that are improved when information providing from many different sources is considered. Also, profitable decisions are the result of a careful balance between action (transaction) and inaction (buy-and-hold). © 2017, The Natural Computing Applications Forum.","Algorithmic trading; Evolutionary algorithms; Multi-objective; Portfolio optimization","Commerce; Evolutionary algorithms; Investments; Monte Carlo methods; Strategic planning; Algorithmic trading; Information providing; Investment decisions; Investment strategy; Multi objective; Portfolio optimization; Portfolio theories; Utility functions; Electronic trading",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85023200670

When generalized to multiple agents, the resulting stochastic game is notoriously difficult to solve in closed-form. Here, we circumvent the difficulties by investigating a mean-field game framework containing (i) a major agent who is liquidating a large number of shares, (ii) a number of minor agents (high-frequency traders (HFTs)) who detect and trade against the liquidator, and (iii) noise traders who buy and sell for exogenous reasons. Our setup accounts for permanent price impact stemming from all trader types inducing an interaction between major and minor agents. Both optimizing agents trade against noise traders as well as one another. This stochastic dynamic game contains couplings in the price and trade dynamics, and we use a mean-field game approach to solve the problem. We obtain a set of decentralized feedback trading strategies for the major and minor agents, and express the solution explicitly in terms of a deterministic fixed point problem. For a finite N population of HFTs, the set of major-minor agent mean-field game strategies is shown to have a ϵN-Nash equilibrium property where ϵN→0 as N→∞. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Algorithmic trading; high-frequency trading; mean-field games and market microstructure theory; optimal execution; stochastic optimal control",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85064625022

Following Goffman's injunction not to ignore the influence on interaction of matters external to it, the paper examines some prominent such matters.

In 2019, most securities trading is conducted electronically on digital markets. One type of trading strategy, high-frequency trading, utilizes algorithms, data centers, fiber optic cables, and supercomputers to obtain an edge in the market. High-frequency trading has leveraged advancements in technology to constitute over half of all trading volume in a given day. High-frequency trading, however, has come under scrutiny in recent years as it has increased market susceptibility to certain forms of criminal conduct. In 2017, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit upheld the first conviction of a high-frequency trader for spoofing, a type of trader misconduct that is made more susceptible by high-frequency trading. While scholars have debated whether high-frequency trading should be regulated more than other types of trading and if so, what the regulations might look like, no one has analyzed criminal law as a vehicle to regulate high-frequency trading. This Comment makes the case that individual criminal liability is an ideal tool to regulate misconduct in the high-frequency trading space. Two features of high-frequency trading make the strategy particularly challenging to regulate: 1) it is difficult to draw a line between legitimate and illegitimate behavior in high-frequency trading; and 2) it is difficult to pinpoint an exact definition of what high-frequency trading is. Criminal liability has several advantages over civil liability with respect to these challenges. First, the mens rea component and higher standard of proof required in criminal liability will ensure that high-frequency traders found criminally liable engaged in illegitimate behavior with a higher degree of certainty. Second, the threat of criminal prosecution will better serve the goal of deterring high-frequency trader misconduct. Within the context of criminal liability, individual criminal liability is preferable to corporate criminal liability because the former better furthers the goal of deterrence. The identity problem that corporate liability helps to solve—in some corporate contexts it is impossible to pinpoint culpability on any single individual—is not an issue in high-frequency trading; and individual criminal liability is socially more preferable as a matter of policy. Accordingly, the government should increase criminal enforcement of high-frequency traders to promote its goal of safeguarding market integrity. © 2019 by Orlando Cosme Jr.",,,Note,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85067023809

First, we propose a trading system that can predict the number of shares to trade. Specifically, we design an automated system that predicts the number of shares by adding a deep neural network (DNN) regressor to a deep Q-network, thereby combining reinforcement learning and a DNN. Second, we study various action strategies that use Q-values to analyze which action strategies are beneficial for profits in a confused market. Finally, we propose transfer learning approaches to prevent overfitting from insufficient financial data. We use four different stock indices—the S&P500, KOSPI, HSI, and EuroStoxx50—to experimentally verify our proposed methods and then conduct extensive research. The proposed automated trading system, which enables us to predict the number of shares with the DNN regressor, increases total profits by four times in S&P500, five times in KOSPI, 12 times in HSI, and six times in EuroStoxx50 compared with the fixed-number trading system. When the market situation is confused, delaying the decision to buy or sell increases total profits by 18% in S&P500, 24% in KOSPI, and 49% in EuroStoxx50. Further, transfer learning increases total profits by twofold in S&P500, 3 times in KOSPI, twofold in HSI, and 2.5 times in EuroStoxx50. The trading system with all three proposed methods increases total profits by 13 times in S&P500, 24 times in KOSPI, 30 times in HSI, and 18 times in EuroStoxx50, outperforming the market and the reinforcement learning model. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Deep Q-learning; Reinforcement learning; Stock trading; Trading strategy; Transfer learning","Automation; Commerce; Deep neural networks; Electronic trading; Financial markets; Forecasting; Profitability; Automated systems; Automated trading systems; Financial trading; Q-learning; Reinforcement learning models; Stock trading; Trading strategies; Transfer learning; Reinforcement learning",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85054321884

To this end, we designed, implemented, and assessed a hybrid micro–macro agent-based model, where price impact arises endogenously through the limit order placement activity of algorithmic traders. Our novel hybrid microscopic and macroscopic model allows us to characterise systemic risk not just in terms of system stability, but also in terms of the speed of financial distress propagation over intraday timescales. We find that systemic risk is strongly dependent on the behaviour of algorithmic traders, on leverage management practices, and on network topology. Our results demonstrate that, for high-crowding regimes, contagion speed is a non-monotone function of portfolio diversification. We also find the surprising result that, in certain circumstances, increased portfolio crowding is beneficial to systemic stability. We are not aware of previous studies that have exhibited this phenomenon, and our results establish the importance of considering non-uniform asset allocations in future studies. Finally, we characterise the time window available for regulatory interventions during the propagation of flash crash distress, with results suggesting ex ante precautions may have higher efficacy than ex post reactions. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Agent-based model; Algorithmic trading; Flash crashes; Limit order book; Portfolio crowding; Systemic risk",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85060297862

It focuses on the UK regime. The insights derived are envisaged to be helpful guides for participants and regulators in financial markets. Design/methodology/approach: This paper used the legal-economics perspective. It relied on primary data from statutes and regulations and secondary data from the public domain to analyze the phenomenon. The analytical framework comprised the following sections: Introduction, MiFID I review, MiFID II scope, MiFID II key concerns and concluding remarks. Findings: Only half of the EU Member States including the UK managed to transpose MiFID II within the 3rd January 2018 effective date. At this early stage of implementation, various teething problems were encountered. These pertained to costs and charges reporting, firm governance, product governance, transaction reporting, best execution and research. Owing to the sheer scale and complexity of MIFID II, most entities barely coped with their reporting obligations. Noting the situation, the Financial Conduct Authority assured firms taking all sufficient steps that they would be treated fairly. Research limitations/implications: The paper was not sufficiently empirical. However, the study benefited reasonably from triangulation of data and perspectives to provide good insights on the implementation effects of the complex and voluminous EU rules for governing financial markets with global implications. Practical implications: Investors could gain from the enhanced transparency and best execution rules. Investment banks could gain from the emerging resilient, integrated and efficient financial markets. Regulators with better access to more and higher quality reporting could intervene more effectively when required. Originality/value: This paper assembled and critically analyzed currently available research insights in these areas so as to provide useful guidance to those needing to work and comply with MiFID II rules and academics teaching financial services law. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Dark pools; High frequency trading; MiFID II; MiFIR; Organised trading facility; Transparency reporting",,Review,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85059870850

We prove existence and uniqueness of the Nash equilibrium and show that, for small transaction costs, the HFTs engage in a “hot potato game,” in which the same asset position is sold back and forth. We then identify a critical value for the size of the transaction costs above, for which all oscillations disappear and strategies become buy only or sell only. Numerical simulations show that, for both traders, the expected costs can be lower with transaction costs than without. Moreover, the costs can increase with the trading frequency if there are no transaction costs but decrease with the trading frequency if transaction costs are sufficiently high. We argue that these effects occur due to the need for protection against predatory trading in the regime of low transaction costs. © 2018 INFORMS.","High-frequency trading; Inverse-positive matrix; Kaluza sign criterion; M-matrix; Market impact; Market impact game; Nash equilibrium; Predatory trading; Transient price impact","Commerce; Computation theory; Electronic trading; Game theory; Inverse problems; Matrix algebra; High-frequency trading; M-matrices; Market impacts; Nash equilibria; Positive matrices; Predatory trading; Price impacts; Sign criterion; Costs",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85062482087

In combination, regulatory reform to encourage competition has resulted in market fragmentation, such that a single financial instrument can now be traded across multiple venues. This has led to the proliferation of high-frequency trading (HFT), and the ability to engage in latency arbitrage (taking advantage of accessing and acting upon price information before it is received by others). The impact of HFT and the consequences of latency arbitrage is a contentious issue. In 2013, Wah and Wellman used an agent-based model to study latency arbitrage in a fragmented market. They showed: (a) market efficiency is negatively affected by the actions of a latency arbitrageur; and (b) introducing a discrete-time call auction (DCA) eliminates latency arbitrage opportunities and improves efficiency. Here, we explore and extend Wah and Wellman's model, and demonstrate that results are sensitive to the bid-shading parameter used for zero-intelligence (ZIC) trading agents. To overcome this, we introduce the more realistic, minimally intelligent trading algorithm, ZIP. Using ZIP, we reach contrary conclusions: (a) fragmented markets benefit from latency arbitrage; and (b) DCAs do not improve efficiency. We present these results as evidence that the debate on latency arbitrage in financial markets is far from definitively settled, and suggest that ABM simulation-a form of decentralised collective computational intelligence-is a productive method for understanding and engineering financial systems. © 2018 IEEE.","Agent-Based Modelling; arbitrage; continuous Double Auction; discrete-time Call Auction; financial Markets; fragmentation; high-Frequency Trading; latency; zIC; zIP","Artificial intelligence; Autonomous agents; Commerce; Computational methods; Efficiency; Financial markets; Simulation platform; Agent-based modelling; arbitrage; Continuous double auction; Discrete time; fragmentation; High-frequency trading; latency; Electronic trading",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85062782750

Successful real human traders, and advanced automated algorithmic trading systems, learn from experience and adapt over time as market conditions change; our DLNN learns to copy this adaptive trading behavior. A novel aspect of our work is that we do not involve the conventional approach of attempting to predict time-series of prices of tradeable securities. Instead, we collect large volumes of training data by observing only the quotes issued by a successful sales-trader in the market, details of the orders that trader is executing, and the data available on the LOB (as would usually be provided by a centralized exchange) over the period that the trader is active. In this paper we demonstrate that suitably configured DLNNs can learn to replicate the trading behavior of a successful adaptive automated trader, an algorithmic system previously demonstrated to outperform human traders. We also demonstrate that DLNNs can learn to perform better (i.e., more profitably) than the trader that provided the training data. We believe that this is the first ever demonstration that DLNNs can successfully replicate a human-like, or super-human, adaptive trader operating in a realistic emulation of a real-world financial market. Our results can be considered as proof-of-concept that a DLNN could, in principle, observe the actions of a human trader in a real financial market and over time learn to trade equally as well as that human trader, and possibly better. © 2018 IEEE.","Automated Trading; Deep Learning; Financial Engineering; Financial Markets; Intelligent Agents","Artificial intelligence; Automation; Commerce; Correlation theory; Deep learning; Facsimile; Financial markets; Intelligent agents; Real time systems; Algorithmic trading system; Automated trading; Conventional approach; Electronic market; Financial engineering; Learning neural networks; Market mechanisms; Proof of concept; Electronic trading",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85056716300

This has created significant demand for people skilled in writing and managing algorithmic trading systems. To provide a complete education and training in this field it is highly desirable to allow students/trainees to study the operation of their own algorithmic trading systems running live on a real financial exchange, interacting dynamically with other automated traders. This paper describes the Bristol Stock Exchange (BSE), a simulator designed and developed to meet that need. BSE provides a full implementation of the Limit Order Book (LOB) at the heart of modern financial exchanges, and includes reference implementations of several well-known leading algorithmic trading systems. BSE allows users to submit a variety of order-types including market, limit, fill-or-kill, time-to-live, immediate-or-cancel, iceberg; orders for specific actions at market-open and market-close; and linked pairs of contingent orders. BSE can be configured to allow empirical studies of issues in order routing between multiple exchanges and the performance of cross-market arbitrage trading algorithms. BSE also has provision for varying the exchange's fee structure, including implementing maker-taker and taker-maker pricing models, The Python source-code for BSE, which has been under ongoing development and extension since 2012, along with extensive documentation, is freely available on the GitHub online public repository, and can be used as a public-domain platform for teaching and research. © 2018 IEEE.","Algorithmic Trading; Financial Engineering; Financial Markets; Limit Order Book; Market Simulator; Simulation for education training; Trading Technology","Artificial intelligence; Commerce; Correlation theory; Digital computers; Education computing; Electronic document exchange; Engineering education; Financial markets; Open source software; Records management; Sea ice; Teaching; Algorithmic trading; Education training; Financial engineering; Limit order book; Market simulators; Electronic trading",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85062797806

Here we consider the converse idea, that using the stock price as the ground-truth in the system may be a better indication of sentiment. Tweets are labelled as Buy or Sell dependent on whether the stock price discussed rose or fell over the following hour, and from this, stock-specific dictionaries are built for individual companies. A Bayesian classifier is used to generate stock predictions, which are input to an automated trading algorithm.

Going beyond existing literature, our focal point here is the rebalancing frequency which we include as an additional parameter in the maximization. The problem is first set up in a control-theoretic framework, and then, the main question we address is as follows: In the absence of transaction costs, does high-frequency trading always lead to the best performance? Related to this question is our prior work on Kelly betting which examines the impact of making a wager and letting it ride. Our prior results indicate that it is often the case that there are no performance benefits associated with high-frequency trading. In the present paper, we generalize the analysis from the single-asset case to a portfolio with multiple risky assets. We show that if there is an asset satisfying a certain dominance condition, then an optimal portfolio consists of this asset alone; i.e., if the trader puts 'all eggs in one basket,' performance becomes a constant function of rebalancing frequency. Said another way, the problem of rebalancing is rendered moot. The paper also includes simulations which address practical considerations associated with real stock prices vis-a-vis the dominance condition. © 2018 IEEE.",,"Commerce; Electronic trading; Financial markets; Constant functions; Focal points; High-frequency trading; Logarithmic growth; Optimal portfolios; Performance benefits; Stock portfolio; Transaction cost; Costs",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85062186515

The objective of this paper is to investigate the liquidity provision of a number of HFTs to determine their effects on aggregate marketplace liquidity. We consider a large data set collected from the Australian Securities Exchange throughout 2013, providing a near complete picture of all trading activity. Our method is to consider temporal bar charts, association scatterplots, faceted plots and network diagrams to provide visualizations that yield both novel and conventional insights into how HFTs are operating in the market, specifically with respect to liquidity provision. Consistent with HFTs avoiding adverse selection, our results show that on aggregate, HFTs often consume rather than provide liquidity. Furthermore, liquidity consumption often occurs very quickly over intra-millisecond time periods. We conclude that HFTs are not exclusively focused on liquidity provision. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.","Data visualization; High frequency trading; Large data; Tick data","Aggregates; Big data; Commerce; Electronic trading; Information management; Investments; Risk management; Software engineering; Visualization; Adverse selection; High frequency HF; High-frequency trading; Large data; Large datasets; Liquidity provisions; Network diagrams; Tick datum; Data visualization",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85063573156

We develop an artificial futures market populated with high-frequency traders (HFTs) and institutional traders using Strongly Typed Genetic Programming (STGP) trading algorithm. We simulate real-life futures trading at the millisecond time frame by applying STGP to E-Mini S&P 500 data stamped at the millisecond interval. A direct forecasting comparison between HFTs and institutional traders indicate the superiority of the former. We observe that the negative implications of high-frequency trading in futures markets can be mitigated by introducing a minimum resting trading period of less than 50 milliseconds. Overall, we contribute to the e-commerce literature by showing that minimum resting trading order period of less than 50 milliseconds could lead to HFTs facing a queuing risk resulting in a less harmful market quality effect. One practical implication of our study is that we demonstrate that market regulators and/or e-commerce practitioners can apply artificial intelligence tools such as STGP to conduct trading behavior-based profiling. This can be used to detect the occurrence of new HFT strategies and examine their impact on the futures market. © 2019, Copyright © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","algorithmic trading; artificial intelligence; big data analytics; Evolutionary computation; financial econometrics; high-frequency trading",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85059671912

This is a major issue, as trading speed overwhelming the capability of the server to cope with the incoming orders might jeopardise the orderly functioning of the markets. It will be shown how, by raising the speed of trading and increasing the number of the agents operating in the market, it is possible to generate a crisis, no matter how performing the exchange server is. The paper presents a theoretical framework and then verifies its occurrence by analysing audit trail data. The theoretical framework shows a scenario in which under certain, heavy but by no means uncommon, conditions, the excess speed of the trading agents with respect to servers is capable of exacerbating price volatility, leading to vicious feedback loops capable of potentially creating a financial crisis. The empirical part analyses data taken from a particularly volatile day and compares them with much less volatile days. It results that, because of excessive speed, one of the most widely used techniques for minimising risk, order churning, can cause a major crisis. © 2018 - IOS Press and the authors.

The novelty of our method is how we leverage three best swarm agents to construct multi-peak solutions that are best suited for the stochastic nature of financial markets. We utilise the variance between the positions of swarm agents in GWO to construct different algorithmic approaches to day trading, with an aim to diversify expected portfolio volatility. Our research showcases how the three best swarms of GWO are best suited to predict stochastic time series problems, as we typically find in the field of finance.

Although the technical details of currently profitable automated trading systems are closely guarded commercial secrets, the rise of robot trading can be traced back to a sequence of key AI research papers. Each of these key papers relied on minimal abstract simulation models of real financial markets: the simulators provide test-beds for trials in which the performance of different trading strategies could be evaluated and compared. Recent studies have revisited these seminal results, using more realistic simulations of contemporary financial markets, and have cast major doubts on core conclusions drawn in the original publications. Therefore, it seems reasonable to argue that present-day simulation methods are exposing significant problems in past research on automated trading.

However, the previously proposed methods rely heavily on domain knowledge to extract handcrafted features and lack an effective way to dynamically adjust the trading strategy. With the recent breakthroughs of deep reinforcement learning (DRL), sequential real-world problems can be modeled and solved with a more human-like approach. In this paper, we propose a novel trading agent, based on deep reinforcement learning, to autonomously make trading decisions and gain profits in the dynamic financial markets. We extend the value-based deep Q-network (DQN) and the asynchronous advantage actor-critic (A3C) for better adapting to the trading market. Specifically, in order to automatically extract robust market representations and resolve the financial time series dependence, we utilize the stacked denoising autoencoders (SDAEs) and the long short-term memory (LSTM) as parts of the function approximator, respectively. Furthermore, we design several elaborate mechanisms to make the trading agent more practical to the real trading environment, such as position-controlled action and n-step reward. The experimental results show that our trading agent outperforms the baselines and achieves stable risk-adjusted returns in both the stock and the futures markets. © 2013 IEEE.","Algorithmic trading; deep neural network; Markov decision process; reinforcement learning","Autonomous agents; Commerce; Deep neural networks; Financial markets; Long short-term memory; Machine learning; Markov processes; Profitability; Reinforcement learning; Algorithmic trading; Financial time series; Function approximators; Long-term profits; Markov Decision Processes; Real-world problem; Trading environments; Trading strategies; Electronic trading",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85071105095

LSE Turquoise is a recently-introduced platform where buying and selling takes place on a pair of coupled trading pools: a lit pool that is visible to all traders; and a dark pool where large ""block"" orders are hidden from sight until they are automatically matched with a counterparty, after which the transaction is then revealed. Orders from traders are routed to the lit or dark pool depending on their size, and on the reputation of the trader issuing the order. Unlike all other public-domain adaptive trading strategies, ISHV can alter the prices it quotes in anticipation of adverse price changes that are likely to occur when orders for block-trades are publicly visible: so-called market impact. LSE Turquoise is intended to reduce the negative effects of market impact; something that we test with our simulator. We extend the existing BSE open-source exchange simulator to incorporate coupled lit and dark pools, naming the new system BSELD. We show ISHV exhibiting market impact in a lit-only pool, and discuss how a Turquoise-style coupled dark pool reduces or eliminates that impact.

Such systems implement algorithmic trading strategies and are configured with predefined optimized parameters in order to generate entry and exit orders and execute trades on trading platforms. Three high-frequency automated trading systems were developed in the current research, using the MACD (oscillator), the SMA (moving average) and the PIVOT points (price crossover) technical indicators. The systems traded on hourly time frames, employing historical data of closing prices and the parameter optimization for each system was done using the d-Backtest PS method over weekly periods. With this work we intend to extend the methods of parameter selection for automated trading systems in high frequency trading. Through this research and the interpretation and evaluation of its results, we conclude that backtesting parameters’ optimization, especially through the d-Backtest PS method, is much more profitable than the default values of the parameters and that the optimization of parameters yields the highest profits through the implementation of restrictive relationships among them. It is also observed that the selection of the most profitable parameters of a trading system can be unrestricted, rendering the validation of the minor divergence occurring among slightly varying prices redundant. Meanwhile, other conclusions that can be drawn are that the most profitable classification system employed by the d-Backtest PS method is calibrated by means of two validation periods and that the most efficient profitability ratio between historical data period and validation period is 6:1 (in- and out-of-the-sample ratio). © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Backtesting optimization algorithms; d-Backtest PS method; Exchange rates (AUDUSD, EURUSD, GBPUSD, USDCAD, USDJPY); Expert backtesting systems; Forex; MACD; Metals (XAUUSD); Optimal historical data period selection; PIVOT; SMA",,Article,"Article in Press",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85076888105

The agent solves a combined optimal stopping and control problem where trading has frictions: MOs (executed by the agent and other traders) have permanent price impact and pay exchange fees, and LOs earn the spread (relative to the midprice of the asset) and pay no exchange fees. We show how the agent replicates the payoff of the claim and also speculates in the asset to maximize expected utility of terminal wealth. In the strategy, MOs are used to keep the inventory on target, to replicate the payoff, and LOs are employed to build the inventory at favorable prices and boost expected terminal wealth by executing roundtrip trades that earn the spread.

The effort in developing formal verification methods is justified considering the large code-base, the complexity in synchronization required in a monolithic kernel and the support for multiple architectures, along with the usage of Linux on critical systems, from high-frequency trading to self-driven cars. Despite recent developments in the area, none of the proposed approaches are suitable and flexible enough to be applied in an efficient way to a running kernel. Aiming to fill such a gap, this paper proposes a formal verification approach for the Linux kernel, based on automata models. It presents a method to auto-generate verification code from an automaton, which can be integrated into a module and dynamically added into the kernel for efficient on-the-fly verification of the system, using in-kernel tracing features. Finally, a set of experiments demonstrate verification of three models, along with performance analysis of the impact of the verification, in terms of latency and throughput of the system, showing the efficiency of the approach. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","Automata; Linux kernel; Testing; Verification","Automata theory; Electronic trading; Formal verification; Memory architecture; Testing; Verification; Automata; Formal verification methods; High-frequency trading; Linux kernel; Memory subsystems; On-the fly verification; Performance analysis; Synchronization primitive; Linux",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85072869563

So far, there have been very limited attempts for extracting relevant features based on the limit order book data. In this paper, we address this problem by designing a new set of handcrafted features and performing an extensive experimental evaluation on both liquid and illiquid stocks. More specifically, we present an extensive set of econometric features that capture the statistical properties of the underlying securities for the task of mid-price prediction. The experimental evaluation consists of a head-to-head comparison with other handcrafted features from the literature and with features extracted from a long short-term memory autoencoder by means of a fully automated process. Moreover, we develop a new experimental protocol for online learning that treats the task above as a multi-objective optimization problem and predicts: 1) the direction of the next price movement and; 2) the number of order book events that occur until the change takes place. In order to predict the mid-price movement, features are fed into nine different deep learning models based on multi-layer perceptrons, convolutional neural networks, and long short-term memory neural networks. The performance of the proposed method is then evaluated on liquid and illiquid stocks (i.e., TotalView-ITCH US and Nordic stocks). For some stocks, results suggest that the correct choice of a feature set and a model can lead to the successful prediction of how long it takes to have a stock price movement. © 2019 IEEE.","Deep learning; econometrics; high-frequency trading; limit order book; mid-price; U.S. data","Automation; Brain; Correlation theory; Economics; Electronic trading; Financial markets; Forecasting; Long short-term memory; Motion estimation; Multilayer neural networks; Multiobjective optimization; Statistics; econometrics; High-frequency trading; Limit order book; mid-price; U.S. data; Deep learning",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85068671731

The agents negotiate with one another to reach the best agreement for the users they represent. An obstacle in the future of automated negotiators is that the agent may not always have a priori information about the preferences of the user it represents. The purpose of this work is to develop an agent that will be able to negotiate given partial information about the user’s preferences. First, we present a new partial information model that is supplied to the agent, which is based on categorical data in the form of pairwise comparisons of outcomes instead of precise utility information. Using this partial information, we develop an estimation model that uses linear optimization and translates the information into utility estimates. We test our methods in a negotiation scenario based on a smart grid cooperative where agents participate in energy trade-offs. The results show that already with very limited information the model becomes accurate quickly and performs well in an actual negotiation setting. Our work provides valuable insight into how uncertainty affects an agent’s negotiation performance, how much information is needed to be able to formulate an accurate user model, and shows a capability of negotiating effectively with minimal user feedback. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.",,"Commerce; Economic and social effects; Electric power transmission networks; Electronic trading; Information use; Linear programming; Smart power grids; Automated negotiations; High-frequency trading; Limited information; Linear optimization; Pair-wise comparison; Partial information; Partial information model; Preference uncertainty; Autonomous agents",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85064942807

Two particular variants are most commonly employed: The Call Market (CALL), also known as the Periodic Double Auction, and the Continuous Double Auction (CDA). While numerous automated trading strategies exist for the Continuous Double Auction, there is a lack of high performing strategies for CALL. The former auction variant is becoming increasingly popular in the context of energy-related auctions in Smart Grids. Therefore, there is a need for efficient trading strategies. This paper explores whether a well-performing trading strategy designed for CDA, namely Zero-Intelligence Plus (ZIP) can be used in CALL. We first study the performance of the ZIP trader in CALL without any modifications. We then design several strategies and demonstrate that we can significantly improve the performance of ZIP in CALL while retaining the market’s high efficiency. As a result, our modified ZIP trader can be employed by autonomous agents, e.g. for trading energy in a CALL in the Smart Grid domain. © 2019 for this paper by its authors.","Automated trading agents; Call markets; Continuous double auctions; Zero-intelligence plus","Autonomous agents; Electric power transmission networks; Linguistics; Machine learning; Smart power grids; Automated trading; Continuous double auction; Double auction; High-efficiency; Smart grid; Trading strategies; Zero intelligence plus; ZIP traders; Commerce",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85075058497

The supporting decisions on Forex rely on provide, by a multi-agent system, as soon as possible advice on what position should be taken: long, short or none. This advice is given by different investment strategies based on agents running based on statistics, economics, mathematics or artificial intelligence methods. However, these strategies are not optimized in terms of HFT (the computational complexity of these strategies is too high and the signals for open/close positions are too late in many cases). Due this fact, the main problem which appear concerns decreasing a computational complexity of the strategy applied in a multi-agent financial decisions support system. In our research we have assumed that for building HFT investment strategy in a-Trader system, the consensus methods are applied. In many cases determination a consensus is impossible to achieve in the required time using only a one-level determination method in which all of the incoming agents’ knowledge is processed at the same time.

The speed at which a trader can react to changes in the market is a key concern in current financial markets but is difficult to study latency issues using conventional market simulators, and is extremely difficult to study ""in the wild"" because of the financial and regulatory barriers to entry in conducting experimental work on real financial exchanges. Our simulator allows an exchange server to be launched in the cloud, specifying a particular geographic zone for the cloud hosting service; automated-trading clients which attach to the exchange can then also be launched in the cloud, in the same geographic zone and/or in different zones anywhere else on the planet, and those clients are then subject to the real-world latencies introduced by planetary-scale cloud communication interconnections. In this paper we describe the design and implementation of our simulator, called DBSE, which is based on a previous public-domain simulator, extended in ways that are partly inspired by the architecture of the real-world Jane Street Exchange. DBSE relies fundamentally on UDP and TCP network communications protocols and implements a subset of the FIX de facto standard protocol for financial information exchange. We show results from an example in which the exchange server is remotely launched on a cloud facility located in London (UK), with trader clients running in Ohio (USA) and Sydney (Australia).

The novel step taken here is to use large-scale compute facilities to brute-force exhaustively evaluate AA in a variety of market environments based on those used for testing it in the original publications. Our results show that even in these simple environments AA is consistently outperformed by IBM’s GDX algorithm, first published in 2002. We summarize here results from more than one million market simulation experiments, orders of magnitude more testing than was reported in the original publications that first introduced AA. A 2019 ICAART paper by Cliff claimed that AA’s failings were revealed by testing it in more realistic experiments, with conditions closer to those found in real financial markets, but here we demonstrate that even in the simple experiment conditions that were used in the original AA papers, exhaustive testing shows AA to be outperformed by GDX. We close this paper with a discussion of the methodological implications of our work: any results from previous papers where any one trading algorithm is claimed to be superior to others on the basis of only a few thousand trials are probably best treated with some suspicion now. The rise of cloud computing means that the compute-power necessary to subject trading algorithms to millions of trials over a wide range of conditions is readily available at reasonable cost: we should make use of this; exhaustive testing such as is shown here should be the norm in future evaluations and comparisons of new trading algorithms. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","Adaptive bidding agents; Auction markets; Automated trading","Artificial intelligence; Electronic trading; Adaptive bidding agents; Auction markets; Automated auctions; Automated trading; Experiment condition; Market environment; Orders of magnitude; Simple environments; Commerce",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85074190847

The market microstructure approach focuses on analysis of market frictions impacting on how new equilibriums are being come upon. Market frictions exist due to fragmented market structure and information asymmetries. Respectively, the article (Part 1) compares ""market microstructure"" and ""market structure""; reveals drivers of spatial and temporal fragmentation (including breakdown of modern trading protocols and participation models); analyzes information (self-)learning of market and adverse selection; makes distinctions between ""market quality"", ""market efficiency"" and ""market liquidity""; and traces how the market efficiency and equilibrium concepts were evolving when market frictions drew attention. How the market microstructure approach may work is demonstrated in the course of a high-frequency trading (HFT) case study in Part 2 of the article. HFT has brought new evidence that market structure matters-both as an environment where tech innovations are only possible and as mechanisms to be adjusted to new challenges-and has outlined directions for further elaborations on basic microstructural concepts.

Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) has made structural changes to the RNN to avoid long-term dependency problems. The empirical research uses the 2010-2017 price panel data of four kinds of soybean futures in China's futures market, and confirms the model's improved predictive ability through statistical tests.

This order, heralded by algorithmic technologies, changes the conditions for the exercise of regulation: to date, it has not yet been fully acknowledged nor understood by regulatory bodies. Computer code, replacing speech and writing, induces a changeover from one normative order to another in contemporary markets: the norm, previously explicated with recourse to interpretation, is now replaced by an order characterized by calculation. Such paradigm change is identified based on a discussion of works by Gilles Deleuze. In so doing, it contributes to the developing research programme in the cultures of high-frequency trading (Lange et al. 2016) and also points at broader issues for conceptualising financial regulation. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Algorithmic trading; Computation; Financial regulation; Gilles Deleuze; Hermeneutic work; Jurisprudence",,Article,"Article in Press",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85066038354

Results show that the Average Linkage algorithm has the best Cophenetic Correlation Coefficient. The proposed method using the best linkage criteria is tested against real data over a two-year dataset of one-minute American stocks returns. The portfolio selection model achieves a good financial return and an outstanding result in the annual volatility of 3.2%.

AA is the most recent in a series of AI trading-agent strategies proposed by various researchers over the past twenty years: research papers contributing major steps in this evolution of strategies have been published at IJCAI, in the Artificial Intelligence journal, and at AAMAS. The innovative step taken here is to brute-force exhaustively evaluate AA in market environments that are in various ways more realistic, closer to real-world financial markets, than the simple constrained abstract experimental evaluations routinely used in the prior academic AI/Agents research literature. We conclude that AA can indeed appear dominant when tested only against other AI-based trading agents in the highly simplified market scenarios that have become the methodological norm in the trading-agents academic research literature, but much of that success seems to be because AA was designed with exactly those simplified experimental markets in mind. As soon as we put AA in scenarios closer to real-world markets, modify it to fit those markets accordingly, and exhaustively test it against simpler trading agents, AA's dominance simply disappears.

Микроструктурный подход фокусируется на изучении рыночных помех, влияющих на то, как «нащупываются» равновесные состояния. Существование помех вызвано прежде всего фрагментированной структурой рынка и информационными асимметриями. В статье сопоставляются понятия «микроструктура рынка» и «структура рынка»; выделяются фак- торы, влияющие на пространственную и временну'ю фрагментацию (в том числе классифи- цируются современные модели торгов и участия в них); анализируются механизмы инфор- мационного (само)обучения рынка и неблагоприятного отбора; проводятся различия между качеством рынка, эффективностью рынка и ликвидностью рынка; прослеживается эволюция определений эффективности и равновесия, связанная с учетом рыночных помех. Реализация микроструктурного подхода иллюстрируется на примере высокочастотной торговли, которая, с одной стороны, дала новые свидетельства практической значимости структуры рынка - и как среды, в которой только и возможны соответствующие технологические инновации, и как механизмов, гибко приспосабливающихся к новым вызовам. С другой стороны, она обозначила направления дальнейшего переосмысления некоторых базовых положений ми- кроструктурного подхода. В статье выявляются связь высокочастотной торговли с фрагмен- тацией рынка, ее воздействие на структуру участников и качество рынка, систематизируются проблемные практики высокочастотной торговли и инструменты ее регулирования, рассма- триваются особенности информационных асимметрий и неблагоприятного отбора в условиях высокочастотной торговли. © 2019, Editorial Board of the Journal Economic Policy.","Efficiency and liquidity; High-frequency trading; Information asymmetry; Market microstructure; Market quality; Market structure; Высокочастотная торговля; Информационная асимметрия; Качество рынка; Ликвидность рынка; Микроструктура рынка; Структура рынка; Эффективность рынка",,Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85065571117

It is not a priori clear what the aggregation period should be in case of continuously traded cryptocurrencies at online exchanges. In this work, we aggregate RV values using minute-sampled Bitcoin returns over 3-h intervals. Next, using the RV time series, we predict the future values based on the past samples using a plethora of machine learning methods, ANN (MLP, GRU, LSTM), SVM, and Ridge Regression, which are compared to the Heterogeneous Auto-Regressive Realized Volatility (HARRV) model with optimized lag parameters. It is shown that Ridge Regression performs the best, which supports the auto-regressive dynamics postulated by HARRV model. Mean Squared Error values by the neural-network based methods closely follow, whereas the SVM shows the worst performance.

As one consequence of this degree of transparency, a long line of recent research has demonstrated that - even in cryptocurrencies that are specifically designed to improve anonymity - it is often possible to track money as it changes hands, and in some cases to de-anonymize users entirely. With the recent proliferation of alternative cryptocurrencies, however, it becomes relevant to ask not only whether or not money can be traced as it moves within the ledger of a single cryptocurrency, but if it can in fact be traced as it moves across ledgers. This is especially pertinent given the rise in popularity of automated trading platforms such as ShapeShift, which make it effortless to carry out such cross-currency trades. In this paper, we use data scraped from ShapeShift over a thirteen-month period and the data from eight different blockchains to explore this question. Beyond developing new heuristics and creating new types of links across cryptocurrency ledgers, we also identify various patterns of cross-currency trades and of the general usage of these platforms, with the ultimate goal of understanding whether they serve a criminal or a profit-driven agenda. © 2019 by The USENIX Association.

Market indicators are used by traders in the stock market, to define entry and exit points of a trade. These indicators are also useful to compare different trading strategies. We take a practical stand for the approaches mentioned above, where the same data feed from the exchange is preprocessed to remove redundant or anomalous content. Furthermore, use of correlation data between different stocks is analysed. (i) MACD crossovers are dealt in two dimensions of variability, the dimensions being frequency of trades and length of trading intervals. (ii) The outputs of different algorithms are passed through a voting classifier to get the best possible accuracy in the ML label-based approach. Precision/Recall analysis is done to qualify the algorithms for skewed data. (iii) Finally, a grid-based trading strategy is analysed. We conclude with a trading strategy, proposed using results of indicators based on the three approaches. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2019.","Grid trading; MACD; Machine learning; Market indicators; Precision; Recall","Commerce; Electronic data interchange; Financial markets; Learning systems; Machine learning; Algorithmic trading; Grid trading; Investing strategies; MACD; Machine learning techniques; Moving average convergence divergence (MACD); Precision; Recall; Electronic trading",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85072891430

The new method uses quantization and volatility information together with feedforward neural networks for achieving high-frequency trading (HFT). The proposed procedures are based on estimating the Forward Conditional Probability Distribution (FCPD) of the quantized return values. From past samples, the conditional expected value can be learned, from which FCPD can be obtained by using a special encoding scheme. Based on this estimation, a trading signal is triggered if the probability of price change becomes significant as measured by a quadratic criterion. Due to the encoding scheme and quantization, the complexity of learning and estimation has been reduced for HFT. Extensive numerical analysis has been performed on financial time series and the new method has proven to be profitable on mid-prices. In order to beat the secondary effects, we focus on the most liquid assets, on which we managed to achieve positive profits. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Algorithmic trading; conditional probability distribution; neural networks; quantization","algorithm; artificial neural network; economic analysis; estimation method; probability",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85048882210

Quantitative trading applies a wide range of computational approaches such as statistics, physics, or machine learning to analyze, predict, and take advantage of big data in finance for investment. This work studies core components of a quantitative trading system. Machine learning offers a number of important advantages over traditional algorithmic trading. With machine learning, multiple trading strategies are implemented consistently and able to adapt to real-time market. To demonstrate how machine learning techniques can meet quantitative trading, linear regression and support vector regression models are used to predict stock movement. In addition, multiple optimization techniques are used to optimize the return and control risk in trading. One common characteristic for both prediction models is they effectively performed in short-term prediction with high accuracy and return. However, in short-term prediction, the linear regression model is outperform compared to the support vector regression model. The prediction accuracy is considerably improved by adding technical indicators to dataset rather than adjusted price and volume.

Betting exchange markets are fairly similar to the financial markets in terms of their operation. Due to the lower market share and newer technology, there are very few tools available for automated trading for betting exchanges. The in-depth analysis of features available in commercial software demonstrates that there is no commercial software that natively supports machine learned strategy development. Furthermore, previously published academic software products are not publicly obtainable. Hence, this work concentrates on developing a full-stack solution from data capture, back-testing to automated Strategy Agent development for betting exchanges.

In this circular design, each new tuple (given its origin stream) starts its processing from a specific join core and passes through all respective join cores in a pipeline sequence to produce final results. We further present a novel two-stage pipeline stream join (Stashed-MJ) that uses a best-effort buffering technique (stash) to maintain intermediate results. In a case that an overwrite is detected in the stash, our design automatically resorts to recomputing intermediate results.

In our proposed methodology, every morning, a thorough statistical analysis is performed to recommend the list of stocks to purchase. Every Buy recommendation is generated after concluding which stocks have the highest probability of a price increase. Later in the day, our engine recommends stocks to Sell, and at what price. For every Sell recommendation, the goal is to secure an opportunistic profit or selectively limit significant loss. We tested our technique and compared it to many different baselines portfolios, funds. Most of the time, our approach significantly surpassed the baseline approach.

Although the supply chain ecosystem of Ethernet has reduced the vulnerability of billions of devices through use of standardised PHY solutions, other recent trends including the Internet of Things (IoT) in both industrial settings and the general population, High Frequency Trading (HFT) in the financial sector, the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and inexpensive drones have made it relevant again for consideration in the design of new products for privacy. One of the general principles of security is that vulnerabilities, once fixed, sometimes do not stay that way. © 2018 IEEE.",,"Electronic trading; Internet of things; Population statistics; Product design; Security of data; Supply chains; Financial sectors; General data protection regulations; General population; High-frequency trading; Industrial settings; Internet of thing (IOT); Recent trends; Electromagnetic compatibility",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85056142908

However, there are only very few works considering the stability of the EFSs, and these studies were limited to certain types of membership functions with specifically predefined parameters, which largely increases the complexity of the learning process. At the same time, stability analysis is of paramount importance for control applications and provides the theoretical guarantees for the convergence of the learning algorithms. In this paper, we introduce the stability proof of a class of EFSs based on data clouds, which are grounded at the AnYa type fuzzy systems and the recently introduced empirical data analytics (EDA) methodological framework. By employing data clouds, the class of EFSs of AnYa type considered in this paper avoids the traditional way of defining membership functions for each input variable in an explicit manner and its learning process is entirely data driven. The stability of the considered EFS of AnYa type is proven through the Lyapunov theory, and the proof of stability shows that the average identification error converges to a small neighborhood of zero. Although, the stability proof presented in this paper is specially elaborated for the considered EFS, it is also applicable to general EFSs. The proposed method is illustrated with Box-Jenkins gas furnace problem, one nonlinear system identification problem, Mackey-Glass time series prediction problem, eight real-world benchmark regression problems as well as a high-frequency trading prediction problem. Compared with other EFSs, the numerical examples show that the considered EFS in this paper provides guaranteed stability as well as a better approximation accuracy. © 1993-2012 IEEE.","AnYa type fuzzy systems; data clouds; evolving fuzzy systems (EFSs); stability","Convergence of numerical methods; Electronic trading; Fuzzy systems; Identification (control systems); Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Membership functions; Online systems; Personnel training; System stability; Adaptation models; Algorithm design and analysis; Data clouds; Evolving Fuzzy Systems; High-frequency trading; Mackey-Glass time series predictions; Methodological frameworks; Non-linear system identification; Stability criteria",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85041239304

However, arising from the SIMD execution model, the branch divergence issue lowers efciency of conditional branching on GPUs, and hinders the development of GPGPU. To achieve runtime on-the-spot branch divergence reduction, we propose the frst on-GPU thread-data remapping scheme. Before kernel launching, our solution inserts codes into GPU kernels immediately before each target branch so as to acquire actual runtime divergence information. GPU software threads can be remapped to datasets multiple times during single kernel execution. We propose two thread-data remapping algorithms that are tailored to the GPU architecture. Effective on two generations of GPUs from both NVIDIA and AMD, our solution achieves speedups up to 2.718 with third-party benchmarks. We also implement three GPGPU frontier benchmarks from areas including computer vision, algorithmic trading and data analytics. They are hindered by more complex divergence coupled with different memory access patterns, and our solution works better than the traditional thread-data remapping scheme in all cases. As a compiler-assisted runtime solution, it can better reduce divergence for divergent applications that gain little acceleration on GPUs for the time being. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.","Branch divergence; GPGPU; Parallel computing; SIMD","Data Analytics; Deep learning; Graphics processing unit; Memory architecture; Parallel processing systems; Algorithmic trading; Branch divergence; General-purpose gpu computing; GPGPU; High performance computing; Memory access patterns; SIMD; Thread-data remapping; Program processors",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85061279949

Firstly, we categorize the virtual servers in the trading system of TSE, each of which is linked to a single trading participant, by the ratio of cancellation and execution in the order placement as well as the number of executions at the opening of the afternoon session. Then, we analyze ordering patterns of the servers in the categories in short intervals for the top 10 highest trading volume stocks. By classifying the intervals into four cases by returns, we observe how different types of market participants submit or execute orders in the market situations. Moreover, we investigate the shares of the executed volumes for the different types of servers in the swings and roundabouts of the Nikkei 225 index, which were observed in September in 2015. The main findings of this study are as follows: Server type A, which supposedly includes non-market making proprietary traders with high-speed algorithmic strategies, executes and places orders along with the direction of the market. The shares of the execution and order volumes along with the market direction increase when the stock price moves sharply. Server type B, which presumably includes servers employing a market making strategy with high cancellation and low execution ratio, shifts its market making price ranges in the rapid price movements. We observe that passive servers in Server type B have a large share and buy at low levels in the price falls.

We link the implementation of this change to a shift in the volume of trades from a low-cost venue to a high-cost venue. We argue that this outcome is predicted by the incentives of the venues, non-profit stock exchanges owned by different types of members.

In this article, we use the teaching and learning of economics as a case study to illustrate the application of artificial intelligence (AI) based robotic players to help engage students in online, asynchronous environments, therefore, potentially improving student learning outcomes. In particular, students could learn about competitive markets by joining a market full of automated trading robots who find every chance to arbitrage. Alternatively, students could learn to play against other humans by playing against robotic players trained to mimic human behavior, such as anticipating spiteful rejections to unfair offers in the Ultimatum Game where a proposer offers a particular way to split the pot that the responder can only accept or reject. By training robotic players with past data, possibly coming from different country and regions, students can experience and learn how players in different cultures might make decisions under the same scenario.

Despite commonly held negative perceptions, the available evidence indicates that HFT and algorithmic trading may have several beneficial effects on markets. However, these types of trading may cause instabilities in financial markets in specific circumstances. Carefully chosen regulatory measures are needed to address concerns in the shorter term. However, further work is needed to inform policies in the longer term, particularly in view of likely uncertainties and lack of data.

The system uses fundamental analysis ratios, more precisely market valuation ratios, as clustering variables to differentiate between undervaluated and overvaluated stocks. To structure investment portfolio, the proposed system uses special weighting formulas which automatically diversify investment funds. Finally, a simple trading simulation engine is developed to test our system on real market data.

Computers have been used in various fields. Algorithmic trading is beginning to develop rapidly in the trading market, more and more algorithms begin to be used in the transaction market. As a form of machine learning, neural network can fully reveal the complex trading market. Based on the characteristics of commodity futures market, this paper chooses back propagation neural network to establish price forecasting model. And then, according to the rules of futures market, a self-evolving commodity futures trading strategy is proposed. We also use the data of the Shanghai Futures Exchange and the Dalian Futures Exchange to back-testing the strategy. Finally, we compare the proposed strategies and traditional strategies, and illustrate the evolution of our strategy. Experiments show that our strategies are superior to other compared strategies in the proposed evaluation indicator. Our strategy has a good performance both in yield and risk. It also proves the feasibility of the model and the strategy.

Such events occur very frequently, several hundred times a day for actively traded stocks. We find significant price impact associated with these market maker initiated events, about five times higher than during non-burst periods. Bursts in quotes are concurrent with short-lived structural breaks in the informational relationship between market makers and market takers. During bursts, market makers no longer passively impound information from order flow into quotes—a departure from the traditional market microstructure paradigm. Rather, market makers significantly impact prices during bursts in quotes. Further analysis shows that there is asymmetry in adverse selection between the bid and ask sides of the limit order book and only a sub-population of market makers enjoys an informational advantage during bursts. Market makers on the side opposite the burst suffer elevated adverse selection costs, while market makers on the side of the burst realize positive spread, irrespective of the order flow direction. Our results call attention to the need for a new microstructure perspective in understanding modern high-frequency limit order book markets and the quote manipulation strategies at the disposal of the fast market makers. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Adverse selection; Burst; C58; G14; G28; High-frequency trading; Market quality; Price impact",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85042229239

The flaw - essentially, a glitch introduced in the transition from human-based financial exchanges to electronic ones - is to treat time as a continuous variable, and process requests to trade serially. This combination of continuous time and serial processing creates mechanical arbitrage opportunities based on symmetric public information - a violation of efficient markets theory, built right into the market design! - - which in turn harms liquidity provision and induces a never-ending, socially wasteful, arms race for speed. That is, much of high-frequency trading is a symptom of flawed market design. We propose an alternative market design, called frequent batch auctions, in which time is discrete and orders are batch processed using auctions, and show that this directly fixes the problem with the continuous market. The second part of this talk will ask whether the “market will fix the market?” - that is, whether market forces will lead to the adoption of discrete-time trading instead of continuous-time trading, or whether a regulatory intervention would be needed. This requires a model of how modern stock exchanges compete and earn profits, the subject of new work-in-progress with Lee and Shim [2]. The model shows that competition among stock exchanges is fierce on the dimension of traditional trading fees, but that exchanges have market power in the sale of exchange-specific speed technology - i.e., arms for the arms race. We then use the model to study the private and social returns to market design innovation. We find that even though the social returns to adopting discrete-time trading would be large and positive, the private returns can be negative, due to the loss of rents from speed technology. We discuss some modest policy interventions that could tip the balance of incentives and encourage the “market to fix the market”. Last, I will discuss some open questions about financial market design that lie at the intersection of economics and computer science. © 2018 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).","Efficient markets; Frequent batch auctions; High-frequency trading; Market design; Sniping","Computation theory; Continuous time systems; Correlation theory; Costs; Electronic trading; Financial markets; Arbitrage opportunity; Continuous variables; Frequent batch auctions; High-frequency trading; Liquidity provisions; Market design; Regulatory interventions; Sniping; Commerce",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85050119374

This statement was also confirmed by the analysis of dozens of multi-dimensional synthetic time series data generated by excitable medium models frequently considered in studies of chaos.

Genetic programming (GP) has been used effectively as an artificial intelligence technique in the financial field, especially for forecasting tasks in financial markets. In this paper, GP is employed as a means of automatically generating short-term trading rules on financial markets using technical indicators and fundamental parameters. The majority of forecasting tools use a fixed physical timescale, which makes the flow of price fluctuations discontinuous. Therefore, using a fixed physical timescale may expose investors to risks, due to their ignorance of some significant activities. Instead of using fixed timescales for this purpose, the trading rules are generated under a directional-change (DC) event framework. We examine the profitability of the trading systems for the Saudi Stock Exchange, and evaluate the GP forecasting performance under a DC framework through agent-based simulation market index trading. The performance of the forecasting model is compared with a number of benchmark forecasts, namely the buy-and-hold and technical analysis trading strategies. Our numerical results show that the proposed GP model under a DC framework significantly outperforms other traditional models based on fixed physical timescales in terms of portfolio return. © 2018 Infopro Digital Risk (IP) Limited.","Automated trading strategy; Decision support tool; Directional changes (DCs); Financial forecasting; Genetic programming (GP)",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85049692016

To model the structural dependence, the mid-price processes follow a multivariate reflected Brownian motion on the closure of a no-arbitrage region which is dictated by the bid-ask spreads of the assets. We provide a mathematical framework for such an economy and solve for the value function and optimal control for an investor who takes positions in these assets. The optimal strategy exhibits two dominant features which depend on how far the vector of mid-prices is from the no-arbitrage bounds. When mid-prices are sufficiently far from the no-arbitrage edges, the strategy behaves as that of a market maker who posts buy and sell limit orders. And when the mid-price vector is close to the edge of the no-arbitrage region, the strategy executes a combination of market orders and limit orders to profit from statistical arbitrages. We discuss a numerical scheme to solve for the value function and optimal control, and perform a simulation study to discuss the main characteristics of the optimal strategy. © 2018 World Scientific Publishing Company.","Algorithmic trading; High-frequency trading; Impulse control; Limit orders; Market orders; No-arbitrage bounds; Optimal trading; Stochastic control",,Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85048016704

For instance, by allowing expectations about the future to become more harmonized and orderly, they act as stabilizers for the provision of liquidity. Conventions might, of course, change at any time. Nonetheless, by being attached to the daily trading routine and/or integrated within the institutional structure, the confidence in their relevance and validity can be long-lasting. In the foreign exchange market, in particular, where prices are quoted to end-users on demand, market-making banks rely on a convention to quote prices to each other to maintain liquidity. However, the rise of algorithmic and high-frequency trading poses a practical as well as a theoretical challenge to such conventions. By reacting ultra-fast to new information, including to new limit orders submitted by others, markets largely populated with algorithmic traders have become susceptible to a withdrawal of liquidity at an unprecedented speed and scale. Using a high-frequency dataset provided by Electronic Broking Services (EBS), we investigate the process of liquidity withdrawal from the foreign exchange spot market. By doing so, we consider the crowding out of conventions associated with liquidity provision, traditionally upheld through mutual understanding among financial institutions–in other words, reciprocity and trust among humans. © 2018, © 2018, Journal of Economic Issues / Association for Evolutionary Economics.","algorithmic trading; conventions; foreign exchange; high-frequency trading; limit-order book; liquidity",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85048579480

In contemporary stock markets, high frequency trading bots that continuously buy and sell stocks, increasingly perform the role of market makers. These bots provide the market with liquidity by usually being ready to take the buy or sell end of a stock trade. However, these algorithms are also reading news stories and social media posts at lightning speed, and when they detect uncertainty they will pull out of the market causing a stock, or group of stocks, to drop rapidly in value. This text examines the technical and legal aspects of the contemporary networked stock exchange system that make Public Dissentiment’s intervention possible and provides a context for these factors through an analysis of how they produced a space for artistic intervention. Locating this work in the frames of hacktivism, tactical media, and other historical precedents for both network and financial interventions further contextualizes this project.

We encode in this model some of the main features of market microstructure in the context of high frequency trading: high degree of endogeneity of market, no-arbitrage property, buying/selling asymmetry and presence of metaorders. We prove that when the first three of these stylized facts are considered within the framework of our microscopic model, it behaves in the long run as a Heston stochastic volatility model, where a leverage effect is generated. Adding the last property enables us to obtain a rough Heston model in the limit, exhibiting both leverage effect and rough volatility.

The results show that (i) a higher proportion of boundedly-rational sellers induces a higher market price, higher sellers’ profits and a higher market efficiency; (ii) a higher proportion of boundedly-rational sellers induces a lower number of trades and lower buyers’ profits; (iii) a higher proportion of boundedly-rational buyers induces a lower market price, a lower number of trades, and lower sellers’ profits; (iv) a higher proportion of boundedly-rational buyers induces higher buyers’ profits and a higher market efficiency. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Agent-based modeling; Algorithmic trading; Double auctions; Individual rationality; Social networks","Autonomous agents; Computational methods; Efficiency; Electronic trading; Profitability; Sales; Social networking (online); Agent-based model; Algorithmic trading; Artificial stock markets; Buyers and sellers; Continuous double auction; Double auction; Individual rationality; Trading strategies; Commerce",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85039790849

It begins before 1960, when there was no database widely available to conduct a statistical analysis of stock price movements. This changed in the 1960s with the introduction of the Center for Research in Security Prices database. A major finding was the heavy-tailed nature of stock returns. The 1960s also brought major theoretical developments, including the martingale theory of stock price processes and the efficient market hypothesis. This hypothesis prevailed until the 1990s, when the discovery of market anomalies led to statistical arbitrage strategies. We describe the use of modern machine learning methods, such as AdaBoost and random forests, which can combine some of these strategies into an improved trading strategy. The twenty-first century was marked by the rapid evolution of electronic markets and the rise of computer-driven high-frequency trading based on computing technology, low latency access, and limit order book modeling.

Using ultra-high-frequency data from the Nasdaq exchange, we perform empirical analysis on various LO book events and propose novel ways for modelling some of these events, including cancellation of LOs in various positions and size of market orders. Based on our empirical findings, we develop a queuing model that captures stylized facts on the data. This model includes a distinct feature which allows for a potentially random effect due to the agent’s impulse control. We apply the queuing model in an algorithmic trading setting by considering an agent maximizing her expected utility through placing and cancelling of LOs. The agent’s optimal strategy is presented after calibrating the model to real data. A simulation study shows that for the same level of standard deviation of terminal wealth, the optimal strategy has a 2.5% higher mean compared to a strategy which ignores the effect of position, or an 8.8% lower standard deviation for the same level of mean. This extra gain stems from posting an LO during adverse conditions and obtaining a good queue position before conditions become favourable. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","adverse selection; Algorithmic trading; high frequency trading; impulse control; limit order book; queuing model",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85051816027

Flusser’s theory highlights three aspects of technical images: they are engendered by the act of organizing particles, are produced by people who operate devices through keys, and are mediated by code, which is linear and pertains to the era of written text, which Flusser conflates with the notion of history. In this article, the argument focuses on the aspects of high-frequency trading and the blockchain that relate to the idea of images. The sections investigate how money has historically operated in the logic of Flusser’s description of symbol manipulation in relation to consciousness and temporality: from the circular time of magical consciousness to the linear time of historical consciousness, and more recently, to the non-dimensional time of post-historical consciousness. The article argues that there are two levels, or layers, in the images involved in cryptocurrencies or algorithmic trading, but only one of them is visible to the human operator or viewer, in the form of a price. The other, which indeed represents the operations in the system, is only accessible to the machines themselves. The questions raised concern the role of these recent digital financial and monetary forms in the development of a reality dominated by apparatuses and technical images. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Bitcoin; Blockchain; Finance; High-frequency trading; Money; Technical image",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85043307824

In this article, we focus on the sharp upward trend in stock trading since the 1980s. Globally, trading in equity markets have now hit over $100,000 billion, equivalent to nearly 150% of GDP, compared with only 5% in 1975. What is the ""social utility"" of all these trades? Stock market liquidity is undoubtedly a key factor in the cost of capital and, as such, a determinant of economic growth. However, the marginal effect is likely decreasing. Furthermore, many studies suggest that above a certain threshold, trading has a negative effect since: (i) companies benefit from the involvement of long-term investors; (ii) investors tend to perform too many trades; and (iii) it comes at the expense of transparency and erodes the trust vis-à-vis stock markets. A handful of measures have been taken to, if not reduce, then at least limit the growth in stock trading, but these have had only a very limited effect. Only comprehensive reforms of the architecture of stock markets could reverse this trend.

Considering the increasing adoption of advanced computational methods in automated trading strategies, this article argues that the event of price is the direct manifestation of the incomputability at the heart of market exchange. In doing so, it questions the ontological assumptions of “flow” and “fluidity” underpinning traditional conceptions of liquidity and challenges the notion of rationality in market behavior.

Financial managers are able to deal with a limited amount of information. There are many ways to implement algorithmic trading systems.

It then moves toward an automata- or organism-based perspective of CEF, involving nature-inspired intelligence, algorithmic trading, automated markets, network- and agent-based computing, and neural computing. As an alternative way to introduce this novel skeleton, the chapter starts with a view of computation or computing, addressing what computational economics intends to compute and what kinds of economics make computation so hard, and then it turns to a view of computing systems in which the Walrasian kind of computational economics is replaced by the Wolframian kind due to computational irreducibility. © Oxford University Press 2018.

We show that there is a large body of empirical literature that documents a decrease in transaction costs following a decrease in the minimum tick size. However, even though market liquidity increases, the incentive to provide market making activities decreases. We document a strong link between the minimum tick size regulations and the recent increase in high frequency trading activity. A smaller tick enhances the price discovery process. However, the question of how multiple tick size regimes affect market liquidity in a fragmented market remains to be answered.

NY Attorney General Eric Schneiderman has referred to such fast data feeds as “Insider Trading 2.0”. For example, Thomson Reuters sold the University of Michigan’s Consumer Sentiment Index to computerized trading firms 2 seconds before releasing its data to its other paying clients. This paper explores the ethical issues involved in the sale of such information. Is selling faster access ethically the same as traditional insider trading, which generally involves a breach of fiduciary duty or the use of misappropriated information? Such practices are extremely different from traditional insider trading as there is neither a breach of fiduciary duty nor misappropriation of inside information. The ethical issues are similar to other market segmentation and price discrimination issues, in which different prices are charged to different customers. The ability to price discriminate across segments can actually benefit large segments of the population who may receive lower prices because others, such as the high-speed traders, are paying more. The sale of faster access to information, especially by exchanges, raises additional ethical issues. There may be adverse effects on market quality that must be addressed. The moral distaste for the practice expressed by some stems from the seeming unfairness of a modern market structure that provides advantages to a small group of computerized traders. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Consumer Sentiment Index; High-frequency trading; Insider trading; Market segmentation; Price discrimination",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85009787126

Based on these empirical findings, we introduce and calibrate a Markov chain-modulated pure jump model of price, spread, LO and MO arrivals and volume imbalance. As an application of the model, we pose and solve a stochastic control problem for an agent who maximizes terminal wealth, subject to inventory penalties, by executing trades using LOs.

The advances in technology have largely increased the speed of communication and trading. This has given birth to the development of algorithmic trading (AT) and high-frequency trading (HFT). The proliferation of AT and HFT has raised many issues regarding their impacts on the market. This paper proposes a framework characterized by an agent-based artificial stock market where market phenomena result from the interaction between many heterogeneous non-HFTs and HFTs. In comparison with the existing literature on the agent-based modeling of HFT, the traders in our model adopt a genetic programming (GP) learning algorithm. Since they are more adaptive and heuristic, they can form quite diverse trading strategies, rather than zero-intelligence strategies or pre-specified fundamentalist or chartist strategies. Based on this framework, this paper examines the effects of HFT on price discovery, market stability, volume, and allocative efficiency loss. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018.","Agent-based modeling; Artificial stock market; Continuous double action; Genetic programming; High-frequency trading",,Book Chapter,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85057236104

This paper will present a mathematical model for the cyclicality of the price evolution. The model can be applied for any equity in any financial market, using any timeframe. The method will gives us information about when is good to buy and when is better to sell. The price cyclicality model is also a method to establish when the price is approaching to change its behavior in order to build limit conditions to stay away the market and to minimize the risk. The fundamental news is already included in the price behavior. Being exclusively a mathematical model based on the price evolution, this method can be easily implemented in algorithmic trading.

In order to enhance the market efficiency and liquidity, the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) has granted Thai stock brokers permission to develop and offer their customers algorithm and automatic stock trading. However, algorithm trading on SET was not widely adopted. This chapter intends to design and empirically estimate a model in explaining Thai investors’ acceptance of algorithm trading. The theoretical framework is based on the theory of reasoned action and technology acceptance model (TAM). A sample of 400 investors who have used online stock trading and 300 investors who have used algorithm stock trading were observed and analyzed using structural equations model (SEM) and generalized linear regression model (GLM) with a Logit specification. The results confirm that attitudes, subjective norm, perceived risks, and trust toward algorithm stock trading are factors determining investors’ behavior and acceptance of using algorithm stock trading. Investor’s perception and trust on algorithm stock trading as a trading strategy is a major factor in determining their perceived behavior and control, which affect their decision on whether to invest using algorithm trading. Accordingly, it can be concluded that Thai investors is willing to accept algorithm trading as a new financial technology, but still has concern about the reliability and profitable of this new stock trading strategy. Therefore, algorithm trading can be promoted by building inves-tors’ trust on algorithm trading as a reliable and profitable trading strategy. © 2018 by Emerald Publishing Limited.

This trading model design is the result of a path of investigation that was chosen nearly three decades ago. Back then, a paradigm change was proposed for the way time is defined in financial markets, based on intrinsic events. This definition lead to the uncovering of a large set of scaling laws. An additional guiding principle was found by embedding the trading model construction in an agent-base framework, inspired by the study of complex systems. This new approach to designing automated trading algorithms is a parsimonious method for building a new type of investment strategy that not only generates profits, but also provides liquidity and stability to financial markets and does not have a priori restrictions on the amount of assets that are managed. © 2018 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,"Automation; Commerce; Financial markets; Investments; Profitability; Agent-base; Automated trading; Guiding principles; Investment management; Investment strategy; New approaches; Trading models; Electronic trading",Book Chapter,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85046917193

Turnover from HFT alone may be around 40% and 60% for the European and US equity markets, accordingly. The activity of algorithmic and high-frequency trading has also caused some concerns related to toxic liquidity in the financial market. These concerns reached their peak after the Flash Crash of 6 May 2010 in the US. After some reports of the Flash Crash reached the conclusion that what triggered the freefall was an algorithm, there were questions on whether HFT traders could induce toxic liquidity. The aim of this paper is to present sources and conditions for which toxic liquidity may arise, as well as arguments that high-frequency traders may not necessarily be the source of toxic liquidity. Not only can they be a legitimate source of natural liquidity but also toxic liquidity may actually be attributable to low frequency traders.

Research aimed at understanding the dynamics of this new style of financial market is hampered by the fact that no operational real-world financial exchange is ever likely to allow experimental probing of that market while it is open and running live, forcing researchers to work primarily from time-series of past trading data.

To this end, a large variety of machine learning algorithms have been examined. However, it is now widely understood that, in real-world trading settings, no single machine learning model can consistently outperform the alternatives. In this work, we examine the efficacy and the feasibility of developing a stacked generalization system, intelligently combining the predictions of diverse machine learning models. Our approach establishes a novel inferential framework that comprises the following levels of data processing: (i) We model the dependence patterns between major currency pairs via a diverse set of commonly used machine learning algorithms, namely support vector machines (SVMs), random forests (RFs), Bayesian autoregressive trees (BART), dense-layer neural networks (NNs), and naïve Bayes (NB) classifiers. (ii) We generate implied signals of exchange rate fluctuation, based on the output of these models, as well as appropriate side information obtained by analyzing the correlations across currency pairs in our training datasets. (iii) We finally combine these implied signals into an aggregate predictive waveform, by leveraging majority voting, genetic algorithm optimization, and regression weighting techniques. We thoroughly test our framework in real-world trading scenarios; we show that our system leads to significantly better trading performance than the considered benchmarks. Thus, it represents an attractive solution for financial firms and corporations that perform foreign exchange portfolio management and daily trading. Our system can be used as an integrated part in international commercial trade activities or in a quantitative investing framework for algorithmic trading and carry-trade speculation. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Algorithmic trading; Forex forecasting; Machine learning; Portfolio management; Stacked generalization",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85027974046

One such technological advent, in the pursuit for minimizing the risk and maximizing the return and in order to adhere to the financial sector changes, is Algorithmic Trading (AT). Though AT is being used extensively across the world, there is a lack of academic research on the evidence of AT in most of the markets. The lack of evidence stems from the ambiguity in definitions of AT and High Frequency Trading (HFT) and their usage interchangeably. The lack of evidence also hinders the understanding and interpretation of the impact of ever-increasing unprecedented growth in the velocity of financial transactions on the social machinery of global economies. We take advantage of the clear definition and identification of AT in the Indian equity market to provide evidence of AT and interpreting it as the transaction velocity element of financialization.

Capability theory is also consistent with bounded rationality and the adaptive markets hypothesis, and defines the point at which these firms reach a satisfactory solution.

While the recent advance of portfolio selection in HFT market enables to bring about more profit, it yields much contended OLTP workloads. Featuring exploiting the abundant parallelism, transaction pipeline, the state-of-the-art concurrency control (CC) mechanism, however, suffers from limited concurrency confronted with HFT workloads. Its variants that enable more parallel execution by leveraging fine-grained contention information also take little effect. To solve this problem, we for the first time observe and formulate the source of restricted concurrency as harmful ordering of transaction statements. To resolve harmful ordering, we propose PARE, a pipeline-aware reordered execution, to improve application performance by rearranging statements in order of their degrees of contention. In concrete, two mechanisms are devised to ensure the correctness of statement rearrangement and identify the degrees of contention of statements, respectively. We also study the off-line reordering problem. We prove that this problem is NP-hard and present an off-line reordering approach to approximate the optimal reordering strategy. Experiment results show that PARE can improve transaction throughput and reduce transaction latency on HFT applications by up to an order of magnitude than the state-of-the-art CC mechanism. © 2017, The Author(s).","Concurrency control; Off-line reordering; Online reordering; Reordered execution",,Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85065017179

Many works report on the use of data mining techniques to predict the future direction of stock prices and to discover patterns in the time series data to provide decision support for trading operations. Traditional optimization methods do not take into account the possibility that the function to be optimized, namely, the final financial balance for operations considering some stock, may have multiple peaks, i.e., be represented by multimodal functions. However, multimodality is a known feature of real-world financial time series optimization problems. To deal with this issue, this article proposes the PAA-MS-IDPSO-V approach (Piecewise Aggregate Approximation - Multi-Swarm of Improved Self-adaptive Particle Swarm Optimization with Validation). The proposed method aims to find patterns in financial time series to support investment decisions. The approach uses multi-swarms to obtain a better particle initialization for the final optimization phase since it aims to tackle multimodal problems. Furthermore, it uses a validation set with early stopping to avoid overfitting. The patterns discovered by the method are used together with investment rules to support decisions and thus help investors to maximize the profit in their operations in the stock market. The experiments reported in this paper compare the results obtained by the proposed model with the Buy-and-Hold, PAA-IDPSO approaches and another approach found in the literature. We report on experiments conducted with S&P100 index stocks and using the Friedman Non-Parametric Test with the Nemenyi post-hoc Test both with 95% confidence level. The results show that the proposed model outperformed the competing methods and was able to considerably reduce the variance for all stocks. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Data mining; Multi-swarm optimization; Particle swarm optimization; Pattern discovery; Stock market; Time series representation","Aggregates; Commerce; Data mining; Decision support systems; Finance; Financial data processing; Financial markets; Investments; Optimization; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Time series; Adaptive particle swarm optimizations; Financial time series; Investment decisions; Multi modal function; Multi-swarms; Optimization problems; Pattern discovery; Piecewise aggregate approximation; Electronic trading",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85031827771

One important change, known as price impact, relates to how trading affects prices. Price impact represents the largest cost associated with trading. Forecasting price impact is very important as it can provide estimates of trading profits after costs and also suggest optimal execution strategies. Although several models have recently been developed which may forecast the immediate price impact of individual trades, limited work has been done to compare their relative performance. We provide a comprehensive performance evaluation of these models and test for statistically significant outperformance amongst candidate models using out-of-sample forecasts. We find that normalizing price impact by its average value significantly enhances the performance of traditional non-normalized models as the normalization factor captures some of the dynamics of price impact.

First, orders to buy and sell represent flows of shares over time rather than stocks of shares available for immediate purchase or sale. Second, orders are expressed as continuous piecewise linear functions relating price to quantity rather than step functions defined on a discrete grid of prices and quantities. Continuous scaled limit orders implement Fischer Black's vision of traders limiting temporary price impact by trading gradually over time. They dramatically lessen the rents high-frequency traders earn from the current market design.

Our paper question the effectiveness of a modified cancelled order tax with no exemptions, all orders cancelled or modified within half-second time span are taxed. Our study has important implications for the regulation of HFT; we provide recommendations for regulators in relation to market rules which have yet to be introduced, using an artificial market framework. This paper addresses the question of whether this tax leads to a reduction in HFT activities and, as a result, to deterioration or amelioration of market quality. The evidence we provide should help market regulators to better understand the role played by HFT firms as liquidity suppliers. We show that HFT liquidity is short-lived. With the implementation of tax, decreased HFT activities do not have a statistically significant impact on market volatility and market liquidity measured by bid/ask spreads, but decrease dollar volumes as a liquidity measure. In addition, reduced HFT activities lead to less efficient markets as the deviation from fundamentals increases. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Agent-based modelling; Market liquidity and volatility; Market regulation; Tax on high frequency trading",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85012869537

The abstraction hierarchy and the decision ladder each adopted an additional layer, mapping functions allocated to the trader and to the automation. In addition to the mapping, we marked the four stages of automation on the decision ladder to provide guidance on representing the function allocation at the task level. Next, we compared the DOA layering approach to how automation was represented in the cognitive work analysis literature. We found that a DOA-layered decision ladder, which included well-developed knowledge of the stages and levels of automation, can be suited to modern automated systems with different DOAs.

Evidence suggests that informed traders exploit superior information across trading days, and stocks with lower transparency exhibit stronger information diffusion effects when traded in blocks, thus informed block trading facilitates price discovery. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","Block trades; Informed trading; Opacity; Price discovery; Price impact; Transparency",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84994336815

In our work, we suggest an evolutionary algorithm for generating and selecting the most fitting trading rules for interday trading, which are presented in the form of binary decision trees. A distinctive feature of this approach is the interpretation of the evaluation of the current state of technical indicators with the help of dynamic ranges that are recalculated on a daily basis.

Yet, although intriguing, this view has been seldom quantitatively investigated − and that is the gap found in previous research. A computer simulation has been produced to mimic the behaviour of both slow and fast traders, each category showing characteristics consistent with their behaviour on the markets. In particular, High-Frequency (HF) traders show their preference for aggressive orders when the bid-ask spread is tight and are less aggressive when spread is wide. The Low-Frequency (LF) traders are then forced to live with the remaining deals, hoping to profit from longer term price movements. The purpose of this piece of research is to verify whether HF traders (HFTs) tend to deal with each other and, something not investigated by previous studies, if LF traders also mainly restrict their trading with other slow traders. The results show some tendency toward markets actually splitting into two-tiers: they confirm previous findings of HF traders' tendency to deal with their similar counterparts in case of thin bid-ask spread (which means higher probability of profits for the aggressive side), leaving mostly LF traders to deal amongst themselves when the spread is wider, so aiming at long-term gain (which makes trading inherently riskier). © 2017","Agent-Base Model; High-frequency trading; Simulation; Split; Tier",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85018765732

However, in the post-AT period, while we find a similar pattern in bid-ask spreads, we find no evidence of a significant fall in market depth. We also find firms that experience the largest increase in AT from pre- to post-AT periods, exhibit lower bid-ask spreads and greater depth following earnings announcements.

Trading needs are generated by time-varying private information about the asset value and private values for owning the asset, as well as quadratic inventory costs. We characterize a linear equilibrium with stationary strategies and its efficiency properties in closed form. Frequent trading (more double auctions per unit of time) allows more immediate asset reallocation after new information arrives, at the cost of a lower volume of beneficial trades in each double auction. Under stated conditions, the trading frequency that maximizes allocative efficiency coincides with the information arrival frequency for scheduled information releases, but can far exceed the information arrival frequency if new information arrives stochastically.Asimple calibration of the model suggests that a moderate market slowdown to the level of seconds or minutes per double auction can improve allocative efficiency for assets with relatively narrow investor participation and relatively infrequent news, such as small- and micro-cap stocks. © The Author 2017.","Allocative efficiency; Double auction; High-frequency trading; Trading frequency","allocative efficiency; auction; financial market; trade",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85025817320

This technical analysis indicator is calculated both for 15-min and 1-day timeframes, which enables short and medium terms to be considered simultaneously. We also filter the flags according to the price range on which they are developed and have limited the maximum loss of each trade to 100 points.

Enormous amounts of high-frequency trading data are generated by huge numbers of market participants in every trading day. The availability of this information allows researchers to further examine the statistical properties of informationally efficient market hypothesis (EMH). Heterogenous market hypothesis (HMH) is one of the important extensions of EMH literature. HMH introduced nonlinear trading behaviors of heterogenous market participants instead of normality assumption under the EMH homogenous market participants. In this study, we attempt to explore more high-frequency volatility estimators in the HMH examination. These include the bipower, tripower, and quadpower variation integrated volatility estimates using Heterogenous AutoRegressive (HAR) models. The empirical findings show that these alternatives multipower variation (MPV) estimators provide better estimation and out-of-sample forecast evaluations as compared to the standard realized volatility. In other words, the usage of MPV estimators is able to better explain the HMH statistically.

Extracting valuable information from the large data is very urgent. However, because of some limitations such as memory restrictions, data complexity or time complexity, the majority of traditional data mining methods are time consuming and low efficiency working on big data. In contrast, parallel computing is a common and reliable choice to solve that problem. In this paper, we propose a fuzzy rule discovery algorithm - fuzzy rule based classification system in the framework of MapReduce (FRBCS-MR). The proposed FRBCS-MR algorithm applies parallel computing technology to extract fuzzy rules and build fuzzy rule-base, which combines the advantage of dealing with uncertainty of fuzzy system and the ability of MapReduce in parallel computing. Future goods trading has been gradually transformed from the original manual trading to stylized trading and the stylized trading is considered to be the forefront and the most scientific mode of investment. In the experimental studies, the rules extracted by FRBCS-MR algorithm using future goods data are turned into trading strategies which are to be used in the real automated trading platform TradeBlazer (TB) to compute the profit and loss situation. The result shows that the FRBCS-MR algorithm has good profit ability and possesses a certain guiding significance for investors. © 2017 Technical Committee on Control Theory, CAA.","Big data; Future goods data; Fuzzy rule based classification system; MapReduce",,Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85032171912

This phenomenon, termed financialization, spans all areas including government, finance, health and manufacturing. Recent developments within finance over that past decade have radically altered the way trading occurs. This paper analyses high-frequency trading (HFT) as a necessary component of the infrastructure that makes financialization possible. Through interviews with HFT firms, a software vendor, regulators and banks, the effects of HFT on market efficiency, and its impact on costs to long-term investors are explored. This paper contributes to the literature by exploring the conflict that exists between HFT and traditional market makers in today's fragmented markets. This paper argues that society should be unconcerned with this conflict and should instead focus on the effects these participants have on the long-term investors, for whom the markets ultimately exist. In order to facilitate the best outcomes, regulation should be simple, aimed at keeping participants' behavior stable, and the interactions among them transparent and straightforward. Financialization and HFT are inextricably linked, and society is best served by ensuring that the creative energy of these market participants is directed on providing liquidity and removing inefficiencies. © 2017 Association for Information Technology Trust.","high-frequency trading; liquidity; market maker; regulation","Electronic trading; Finance; Financial markets; Investments; High-frequency trading; liquidity; Market efficiency; Market participants; Market-maker; regulation; Software vendors; Traditional markets; Commerce",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85020063614

On the basis of the electronic market hypothesis, which poses that coordination costs decline when markets become automated, and the efficient market hypothesis in its semi-strong form, we study the effect of HFT on market efficiency in the European fragmented market landscape. In doing so, we further incorporate the realm of financialization, which criticizes the increase in transaction speed. By conducting a long-term analysis of CAC 40 securities, we find that HFT increases market efficiency by leveling midpoints between Euronext Paris and Bats Chi-X Europe. On the basis of a cross-country event study, we analyze the effect of the German HFT Act. We observe that the midpoint dispersion of blue chip securities between the two leading venues Deutsche Boerse and Bats Chi-X Europe increased. We conclude that HFT increases market efficiency in the European market landscape by transmitting information between distant markets. © 2017 Association for Information Technology Trust.","electronic market hypothesis; high-frequency trading; market efficiency; regulation; securities trading","Commerce; Efficiency; Electronic commerce; Electronic trading; Electronic market hypothesis; High-frequency trading; Market efficiency; regulation; Securities trading; Financial markets",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85028548370

We borrow the concept of Social Machines from Web Science as a single concept that captures the essence of all these recent technological changes to argue that the emergence of these Social Machines has aided the transformation of financial markets and society. This study explores the formation of these Social Machines with three sample disruptive technologies - automated/high-frequency trading, social network analytics and smart mobile technology. Through critical reflective analysis of these three case studies, we assess the impact of information technology innovation on financialisation. We adopt three case studies - automated trading; market information extraction using social media technologies; and information diffusion and trader decision-making with mobile technology on financial and real sector changes - which demonstrate the increasing trend of transaction velocity, speculative trading, increased complex information network, accelerated inequality and leverage. Our findings demonstrate that technologically enabled financial Social Machines harness crowd wisdom, engage disparate individual traders to produce more accurate price estimations, and have enhanced decision-making capability. However, these same changes can also have a simultaneously detrimental effect on financial and real sectors, in some situations exacerbating underlying distortions, such as misinformation due to complex information networks, speculative trading behaviour, and higher volatility with transaction velocity. Overall, we conclude that these innovations have transformed the fundamental nature of key aspects of the finance industry and society as a whole. © 2017 Association for Information Technology Trust.","financialisation; high-frequency trading; information technology; social machines; sustainability; trader behaviour","Commerce; Complex networks; Decision making; Finance; Financial markets; Information services; Partial discharges; Social networking (online); Telecommunication equipment; Complex information; Disruptive technology; Finance industries; High speed computer networks; Information diffusion; Information technology innovation; Technological advances; Technological change; Social sciences computing",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85014523064

For example, the high-frequency trading may amplify the deviation on U.S. stock market [1], [2]. Therefore, a reliable method to appraise the asset performance is extremely important to portfolio managers, regulators, and individual investors. One alternative approach to achieve this goal is data envelopment analysis (DEA). Asset performance was ranked from both self- and peer-evaluation perspectives. Specifically, we extended the cross-efficiency analysis in DEA that uses row and column means to portfolio selection and identify different types of asset set. This classification process can help investors to construct a more robust portfolio.

High-frequency traders, that exchange multiple assets simultaneously within a millisecond, are said to be a cause of rapid and large market fluctuations. For such a large-scale problem, this paper proposes a software or computing platform for large-scale and high-frequency artificial market simulations (Plham: /plΛ m). The computing platform, Plham, enables modeling financial markets composed of various brands of assets and a large number of agents trading on a short timescale. The design feature of Plham is the separation of artificial market models (simulation models) from their execution (execution models). This allows users to define their simulation models without parallel computing expertise and to choose one of the execution models they need. This computing platform provides a prototype execution model for parallel simulations, which exploits the variety in trading frequency among traders, that is, the fact that some traders do not require up-to-date information of markets changing in millisecond order. We evaluated a prototype implementation on the K computer using up to 256 computing nodes. © 2017, ISAROB.","Artificial market; High-frequency trading; Multi-asset; Parallel and distributed simulation; Simulation platform","Computer architecture; Electronic trading; Artificial markets; High-frequency trading; Multi-asset; Parallel and distributed simulation; Simulation platform; Commerce",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85020060063

However, these patterns are often elusive as they are affected by many uncertain political-economic factors in the real world, such as corporate performances, government policies, and even breaking news circulated across markets. Moreover, time series of stock prices are non-stationary and non-linear, making the prediction of future price trends much challenging. To address them, we propose a novel State Frequency Memory (SFM) recurrent network to capture the multi-frequency trading patterns from past market data to make long and short term predictions over time. Inspired by Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), the SFM decomposes the hidden states of memory cells into multiple frequency components, each of which models a particular frequency of latent trading pattern underlying the fluctuation of stock price. Then the future stock prices are predicted as a nonlinear mapping of the combination of these components in an Inverse Fourier Transform (IFT) fashion. Modeling multi-frequency trading patterns can enable more accurate predictions for various time ranges: while a shortterm prediction usually depends on high frequency trading patterns, a long-term prediction should focus more on the low frequency trading patterns targeting at long-term return. Unfortunately, no existing model explicitly distinguishes between various frequencies of trading patterns to make dynamic predictions in literature. The experiments on the real market data also demonstrate more competitive performance by the SFM as compared with the state-of-the-art methods. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.","Multi-frequency trading patterns; State frequency memory; Stock price prediction","Costs; Data mining; Discrete Fourier transforms; Electronic trading; Financial markets; Forecasting; Inverse problems; Long short-term memory; Mathematical transformations; Competitive performance; Corporate performance; High-frequency trading; Inverse Fourier transforms; Short term prediction; State-of-the-art methods; Stock price prediction; Trading patterns; Commerce",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85029029639

Our main result gives a diffusion approximation for the mid-price process, which sheds further light on the relation between the mid-price behavior at low frequencies and some LOB features not considered in earlier works. To illustrate the applicability of the proposed framework, we also develop a feasible method to compute several quantities of interest, such as the distribution of the time span between price changes and the probability of consecutive price increments conditioned on the current state of the book. These LOB model features are relevant in many applications such as high frequency trading and intraday risk management. The proposed method is also used to develop an efficient simulation scheme for the price dynamics, which is then applied to assess numerically the accuracy of the diffusion approximation. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Heavy traffic/diffusion approximation; Limit order book modeling; Price process formation","Costs; Electronic trading; Probability distributions; Risk management; Diffusion approximations; Efficient simulation; Heavy traffics; High-frequency trading; Limit order book; Mutually independents; Price process; Quantities of interests; Correlation theory",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85010685460

Furthermore, we test whether the presence of HFT leads to the introduction of colocation services. The data are consistent with the view that HFT pre-dates colocation by at least eight months on most exchanges, and has strong power in explaining the introduction of colocation services. In effect, our results show that colocation services do not properly measure effective AT and HFT; rather, colocation services are the result of HFT. Exchanges choose to offer colocation services due to the fact HFT requires higher speed transactions.

Subscribers must continuously interact with the pub/sub system to remove and insert subscriptions, thereby inefficiently consuming network and computing resources, and sacrificing consistency. In the aforementioned applications, we recognize that the changes in the subscriptions can follow a predictable pattern over some variable (e.g., time). In this paper, we present a new type of subscription, called evolving subscription, which encapsulates these patterns and allow the pub/sub system to autonomously adapt to the dynamic interests of the subscribers without incurring an expensive re-subscription overhead. We propose a general model for expressing evolving subscriptions and a framework for supporting them in a pub/sub system. To this end, we propose three different designs to support evolving subscriptions, which are evaluated and compared to the traditional resubscription approach in the context of two use cases: online games and high-frequency trading.

The proposed binary classification framework can predict the price trends of Taiwan stock index futures after thirty minutes. Traditional learning-based approaches collect all samples during the training period as the learning materials. The major contribution of this paper is to collect a subset of similar historical financial data to train the real-time trading model. This goal can be achieved by an on-line learning technique which is required to calculate an accurate model with training time limitation. In addition, the proposed joint-AdaBoost algorithm is to improve the system performance based on the concept of paired feature learning and planar weak classifier design. The core execution components in this algorithm can be further accelerated with the aid of Open Computing Language (OpenCL) parallel computing platform. The experimental results show that the proposed learning algorithm can improve the prediction accuracy of final classifier from 53.8% to 61.68%. Compared to the pure CPU implementation, the OpenCL version which uses CPU and GPGPU simultaneously can reduce the calculation time around 83.02 times. The efficiency improvement can decrease the delay of investment opportunity which is a critical issue in real-time financial decision support system application. To sum up, this paper proposed a novel learning framework based on joint-AdaBoost algorithm with similar learning samples and OpenCL parallel computation.

I identify causality via a difference-in-difference approach (with German firms and Italian small caps, when appropriate, as control groups) and a regression discontinuity design.

Following the ""Flash Crash"" of 2010 which saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunge 1000 points within minutes, high frequency trading has come under the radar of multi-jurisdictional regulators. Combining a review of the extant literature on high frequency trading with empirical data from interviews with financial traders, computer experts and regulators, we develop concepts of regulatory adaptation, technology asymmetry and market ambiguity to illustrate the 'dark art' of high frequency trading. Findings show high frequency trading is a multi-faceted, complex and secretive practice. It is implicated in market events, but correlation does not imply causation, as isolating causal mechanisms from interconnected automated financial trading is highly challenging for regulators who seek to monitor algorithmic trading across multiple jurisdictions.

Minimizing a risk measure of the implementation shortfall, i.e., the difference between the value of a trader’s initial equity position and the sum of cash flow he receives from his trading process, is essentially a stochastic control problem. In this study, we investigate such a practical problem under a dynamic coherent risk measure in a market in which the stock price dynamics has a feature of momentum effect. We develop a fast approximation solution scheme, which is critical in high-frequency trading. We demonstrate some prominent features of our derived solution algorithm in providing useful guidance for real implementation. © 2017, Operations Research Society of China, Periodicals Agency of Shanghai University, Science Press, and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Approximation solution scheme; Momentum effect; Nested coherent risk measure; Stochastic dynamic programming","Commerce; Electronic trading; Financial markets; Risk assessment; Stochastic control systems; Stochastic systems; Value engineering; Approximation solution; Coherent risk measures; Conditional Value-at-Risk; High-frequency trading; Momentum effects; Optimal trading strategy; Solution algorithms; Stochastic dynamic programming; Dynamic programming",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85020795067

Following Zhou's definition, we assume the observed return Yt is the result of adding microstructure noise to the true but hidden return Xt. Microstructure noise is assumed to be independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.); it is also independent of Xt. When Xt is sampled from a geometric Brownian motion process to yield Yt, the Kalman filter can produce optimal estimates of Xt from Yt. However, the covariance matrix of microstructure noise and that of Xt must be known for this claim to hold. In practice, neither covariance matrix is known so they must be estimated. Our RKF, in contrast, does not need the covariance matrices as input. Simulation results show that the RKF gives essentially identical estimates to the Kalman filter, which has access to the covariance matrices. As applications, estimated Xt can be used to estimate the volatility of Xt. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","High-frequency trading; Kalman filter; Kalman gain; microstructure noise; noise-to-signal-ratio; volatility","Bandpass filters; Brownian movement; Electronic trading; Kalman filters; Microstructure; Synthetic aperture sonar; Covariance matrices; Geometric Brownian motion; High-frequency trading; Kalman gain; Noise-to-signal ratios; Optimal estimates; Robust Kalman filters; volatility; Covariance matrix",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85011382615

The intermediary must then purchase the shares from the market over several days, weeks or as much as several months. Some contracts allow the intermediary to specify when the repurchase ends, at which point the firm and the intermediary exchange the difference between the arrival price and the TWAP over the trading period plus a spread. Hence, the intermediary effectively has an American option embedded within an optimal execution problem. As a result, the firm receives a discounted spread relative to the no early exercise case. Here, we address the intermediary’s optimal execution and exit strategy taking into account the impact that trading has on the market. We demonstrate that it is optimal to exercise when the TWAP exceeds (Formula presented.) where (Formula presented.) is the midprice of the asset and (Formula presented.) is a deterministic function of time and inventory. Moreover, we develop a dimensional reduction of the stochastic control and stopping problem and implement an efficient numerical scheme to compute the optimal trading and exit strategies.

The key idea is to exploit Model Predictive Control, a control-theoretic method that takes into account the system behavior over a future time horizon in order to decide the best reconfiguration to execute. We design a set of energy-aware proactive strategies, optimized for throughput and latency QoS requirements, which regulate the number of used cores and the CPU frequency through the Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) support offered by modern multicore CPUs.

In this paper, an alternative and original approach is explored to capture important activities in the market. The main idea is to use an event-based time scale based on a new way of summarising data, called Directional Changes. Combined with a genetic algorithm, the proposed approach aims to find a trading strategy that maximises profitability in foreign exchange markets. In order to evaluate its efficiency and robustness, we run rigorous experiments on 255 datasets from six different currency pairs, consisting of intra-day data from the foreign exchange spot market.

Based on our findings we report that introduction of cancel order tax only slightly reduces HFT activities, but it significantly affects market liquidity, increases market volatility and leads to deteriorating market efficiency. We conclude that it is difficult to dissuade investors from entering into unproductive trades and eliminate negative outputs of HFT (such as price manipulations) through tax, without altering the benefits of HFT like liquidity provision and efficient price discovery.

First, the parameters of the corresponding Ornstein–Uhlenbeck (OU) process are estimated by auto-regressive Hidden Markov Models (AR-HMM), in order to capture the underlying characteristics of the financial time series. Portfolio optimization is then performed by maximizing the return achieved with a predefined probability instead of optimizing the predictability parameter, which provides more profitable portfolios. The selection of the optimal portfolio according to the goal function is carried out by stochastic search algorithms. The presented solutions satisfy the cardinality constraint in terms of providing a sparse portfolios which minimize the transaction costs (and, as a result, maximize the interpretability of the results). In order to use the method for high frequency trading (HFT) we utilize a massively parallel GPGPU architecture. Both the portfolio optimization and the model identification algorithms are successfully tailored to be running on GPGPU to meet the challenges of efficient software implementation and fast execution time. The performance of the new method has been extensively tested both on historical daily and intraday FOREX data and on artificially generated data series. The results demonstrate that a good average return can be achieved by the proposed trading algorithm in realistic scenarios. The speed profiling has proven that GPGPU is capable of HFT, achieving high-throughput real-time performance. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Financial time series; GPGPU; Hidden Markov models; High frequency algorithmic trading; Mean reversion; Portfolio optimization",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84963994513

However, an often overlooked definite advantage of wireless links over fiber-optic links is that waves travel at the speed of light c, which is about 50% faster than in optical fibers as shown in Fig. 17.9.1 (top left). This 'minimum latency' is crucial for applications requiring real-time responses over a long distance, including high-frequency trading [1]. Further opportunities and new applications might be created if the absolute minimum latency and fiber-optic data-rates are put together. (Sub-)THz frequencies have an extremely broad atmospheric transmission window with manageable losses as shown in Fig. 17.9.1 (top right) and will be ideal for building light-speed links supporting fiber-optic data-rates.

QHawkes models generalize the Hawkes price models introduced in Bacry and Muzy [Quant. Finance, 2014, 14(7), 1147–1166], by allowing feedback effects in the jump intensity that are linear and quadratic in past returns. Our model exhibits two main properties that we believe are crucial in the modelling and the understanding of the volatility process: first, the model is time-reversal asymmetric, similar to financial markets whose time evolution has a preferred direction. Second, it generates a multiplicative, fat-tailed volatility process, that we characterize in detail in the case of exponentially decaying kernels, and which is linked to Pearson diffusions in the continuous limit. Several other interesting properties of QHawkes processes are discussed, in particular the fact that they can generate long memory without necessarily being at the critical point. A non-parametric fit of the QHawkes model on NYSE stock data shows that the off-diagonal component of the quadratic kernel indeed has a structure that standard Hawkes models fail to reproduce. We provide numerical simulations of our calibrated QHawkes model which is indeed seen to reproduce, with only a small amount of quadratic non-linearity, the correct magnitude of fat-tails and time reversal asymmetry seen in empirical time series. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Financial prices; Hawkes processes; High-frequency trading; Market microstructure; Pearsons diffusion; Time-reversal asymmetry; Volatility modelling",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84978539091

In particular, our results indicate that 1-share trades are disproportionately aggressive and also execute against hidden liquidity more than any other odd lot trade size. We also find a relative increase in trading immediately following a 1-share trade. Our results are in line with Clark-Joseph (2014), who suggests that traders may use small, unprofitable trades to detect information from other traders.

The model's predictions are tested with the help of laboratory experiments with economically-motivated human subjects.

This decision is influenced by characteristics of the order flows and queue sizes in each limit order book, as well as the structure of transaction fees and rebates across exchanges. We propose a quantitative framework for studying this order placement problem by formulating it as a convex optimization problem. This formulation allows the study of how the optimal order placement decision depends on the interplay between the state of order books, the fee structure, order flow properties and the aversion to execution risk. In the case of a single exchange, we derive an explicit solution for the optimal split between limit and market orders. For the general case of order placement across multiple exchanges, we propose a stochastic algorithm that computes the optimal routing policy and study the sensitivity of the solution to various parameters.

Enormous investments have been made in creating transmission technologies and optimizing computer architectures, all in an effort to shave milliseconds of order travel time (or latency) within and between markets.

At the third stage, a voting ensemble is designed, weights of base classifiers are selected also using genetic algorithms. However, the usage of genetic algorithms requires considerable time for computing, so the proposed system is implemented in a parallel environment.

In the context of market making, we demonstrate that market makers (MMs) adjust their quotes to reduce inventory risk and adverse selection costs. Moreover, robust market making increases the strategies' Sharpe ratio and allows the MM to fine tune the trade-o- between the mean and the standard deviation of profits.

The ATS introduces the self-generation of new technical indicators and multi-strategies for stopping unforeseen losses. Additionally, this work copes with a novel optimization method combining multi-objective optimization with a grammatical evolution methodology. We implemented the ATS testing three different fitness functions under three mono-objective approaches and also two multi-objective ATSs. Experimental results test and compare them to the Buy and Hold strategy and a previous approach, beating both in returns and in number of positive operations. In particular, the multi-objective approach demonstrated returns up to 20 in very volatile periods, proving that the combination of fitness functions is beneficial for the ATS. © 2017 IOS Press and the authors.

While the recent advance of portfolio selection in HFT market generates more profit, it yields much contended OLTP workloads. Featuring in exploiting the abundant parallelism, transaction pipeline, the state-of-the-art concurrency control (CC) mechanism, however suffers from limited concurrency confronted with HFT workloads. Its variants that enable more parallel execution by leveraging find-grained contention information also take little effect. To solve this problem, we for the first time observe and formulate the source of restricted concurrency as harmful ordering of transaction statements. To resolve harmful ordering, we propose PARE, a pipeline-aware reordered execution, to improve application performance by rearranging statements in order of their degrees of contention. In concrete, two mechanisms are devised to ensure the correctness of statement rearrangement and identify the degrees of contention of statements respectively. Experiment results show that PARE can improve transaction throughput and reduce transaction latency on HFT applications by upto an order of magnitude than the state-of-the-art CC mechanism. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",,"Big data; Commerce; Electronic trading; Information management; Pipelines; Application performance; High-frequency trading; Parallel executions; Portfolio selection; Social welfare; State of the art; Transaction execution; Transaction throughput; Concurrency control",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85028457759

Financial analysts have speculated that they might decrease market transparency and malfunction price discovery, and their interaction would make the situation worse. To validate speculations, artificial market simulation is a tool of study by constructing virtual markets on computers. In this research, by constructing an artificial market simulation, we analyzed how the interaction between HFTs and a dark pool impacts on the market efficiency (in the sense of price discovery) of a (lit) stock market. In simulations, two types of trader agents enter the market. A market maker agent, a representative strategy of HFTs, submit orders to the lit market. We analyzed the market maker's interest rate spread, or simply the spread, as a key parameter for their strategy. Stylized trader agents submit orders to either the lit market or the dark pool with some probability given as a parameter. The simulation results suggest that on the condition that market makers have little impact to market pricing (having a large spread), moderate use of dark pools can promote market pricing.

The problem, however, is that most of these methods is based on daily trading data. When facing the high frequency trading data which is more powerful in short-term forecasting, these methods become incapable. Inspired by the development of Convolutional Neural Network in image recognition tasks, this paper tries to apply the Convolutional Neural Network on the high frequency financial trading data, and has achieved good results. We collect the close price of Shanghai Composite Index from 2006 to 2008 and from 2014 to 2015, about 1000 trading days in total. The frequency of the trading data is 5 min. The paper intends to forecast the stock’s future trend of the next day from historical data, namely, go up or down. First, we apply Hodrick-Prescott decomposition [1] on the original time series. The Hodrick-Prescott filter(decomposition) is a mathematical tool used in macroeconomics to separate the cyclical component ct and trend component τt from a time series. After preprocessing, the proposed method novelly transforms the time series into pictures. We apply GASF, GADF and MTF algorithm [2] on the time series respectively, forming the R, G and B channels of a picture. By transforming each of the time series into picture mode, the trading time series produces a picture library. Finally, the proposed method uses AlexNet architecture as feature extractor and classifier. The net has five convolution layers, three pooling layers, and two fully-connected layers. In data set of time series from 2006 to 2008, we choose the training data and the testing data randomly, and the proposed method can keep the accuracy at about 0.55 on the binary classification problem. In data set of time series from 2014 to 2015, we choose the last 16 training days of the data set as testing data and the accuracy can reach up to 0.60. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Convolutional neural network; Stock forecasting","Commerce; Convolution; Electronic trading; Forecasting; Image recognition; Neural networks; Statistical tests; Time series; Binary classification problems; Convolutional neural network; Financial time series; High-frequency trading; Hodrick-prescott filters; Mathematical tools; Short-term forecasting; Stock forecasting; Classification (of information)",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85034241812

In a networked world, we would like mobile devices to provide a crisp user experience and applications to instantaneously return results. Unfortunately, application performance does not depend solely on processing time, but also on a number of different components that are commonly counted in the overall system latency. Latency is more than just a nuisance to the user, poorly accounted-for, it degrades application performance. In fields such as high frequency trading, as well as in many data centers, latency translates easily to financial losses. Research to date has focused on specific contributions to latency: from improving latency within the network to latency control on the application level. This paper takes an holistic approach to latency, and aims to provide a break-down of end-to-end latency from the application level to the wire. Using a set of crafted experiments, we explore the many contributors to latency. We assert that more attention should be paid to the latency within the host, and show that there is no silver bullet to solve the end-to-end latency challenge in data centers. We believe that a better understanding of the key elements influencing data center latency can trigger a more focused research, improving the user’s quality of experience. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",,"Electronic trading; Losses; Mobile telecommunication systems; Application level; Application performance; End to end latencies; High-frequency trading; Holistic approach; Latency control; Quality of experience (QoE); User experience; Quality of service",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85015839536

And all this data and trading activity has impact among themselves, thus a tight relative timing between different sites in finance trading is mandatory. In the Finance sector the requirements of different actors may be different: transferring legal time from certified institutions to trading centers, time synchronization at a data center scale, deterministic timing for finely coordinated trading actions at a global scale, etc. Our contribution describes how to distribute deterministically a global notion of time across an optical fiber network to arrive at a tight relative timing (accurate time synchronization among the network elements). Another use case is related to low latency which is a highly demanded feature in specific segments (e.g. reduction in exchange latency improves market quality). Latency is a necessary condition for the implementation of various types of strategies and low latency automated trading is associated with lower quoted and effective spreads, lower volatility and greater liquidity. We describe how we can use latency control mechanisms for evaluating it in the framework of a service level agreement.

In Metagaming, Stephanie Boluk and Patrick LeMieux demonstrate how games always extend beyond the screen, and how modders, mappers, streamers, spectators, analysts, and artists are changing the way we play. Metagaming uncovers these alternative histories of play by exploring the strange experiences and unexpected effects that emerge in, on, around, and through videogames. Players puzzle through the problems of perspectival rendering in Portal, perform clandestine acts of electronic espionage in EVE Online, compete and commentate in Korean StarCraft, and speedrun The Legend of Zelda in record times (with or without the use of vision). Companies like Valve attempt to capture the metagame through international e-sports and online marketplaces while the corporate history of Super Mario Bros. is undermined by the endless levels of Infinite Mario, the frustrating pranks of Asshole Mario, and even Super Mario Clouds, a ROM hack exhibited at the Whitney Museum of American Art. One of the only books to include original software alongside each chapter, Metagaming transforms videogames from packaged products into instruments, equipment, tools, and toys for intervening in the sensory and political economies of everyday life.

To develop efficient and effective automated trading strategies, we need to understand the workings of the market and the patterns emerging as a result of the traders interactions. In this paper, we develop an adaptive Genetic Programming (GP) agent-based trading system under Intraday Seasonality Model (ISM), which is abbreviated as GP-ISM trading system. ISM is used for creating maps and visualizing the dynamic price evolution of the asset during the day. This new model permits the recognition of periodic patterns and seasonalities in the price time series and hence eliminates any unnecessary data input. We use a high-frequency dataset of historical price data from Saudi Stock Market, which enables us to run multiple market simulation runs and draw comparisons and conclusions for the developed trading strategies. The goal of our work is to develop automated computational intelligence-based strategies for real markets, and this study facilitates a more thorough understanding of a specific market's workings and constitutes the basis for further exploration into such strategies designed for the stock market. We evaluate the intelligence of the GP-ISM trading system through agent-based simulation market index trading. For comparison, we also include four other types of trading agents in this contest, namely, zero-intelligence agents, Buy-and-Hold agents, fundamental agents and technical analysis agents. As a result, GP-ISM performs the best, which provides a general framework for the further development of automated trading strategies and decision support systems. © 2017 IOS Press and the authors.

State-of-the-art systems process such queries in two steps. Namely, they first construct all trends and then aggregate them. Due to the exponential costs of trend construction, this two-step approach suffers from both a long delays and high memory costs. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Graph-based Real-time Event Trend Aggregation (GRETA) approach that dynamically computes event trend aggregation without first constructing these trends. We define the GRETA graph to compactly encode all trends. Our GRETA runtime incrementally maintains the graph, while dynamically propagating aggregates along its edges. Based on the graph, the final aggregate is incrementally updated and instantaneously returned at the end of each query window. Our GRETA runtime represents a win-win solution, reducing both the time complexity from exponential to quadratic and the space complexity from exponential to linear in the number of events. Our experiments demonstrate that GRETA achieves up to four orders of magnitude speed-up and up to 50-fold memory reduction compared to the state-of-the-art two-step approaches. © 2018 VLDB.",,"Aggregates; Algorithmic trading; Memory reduction; Orders of magnitude; State-of-the-art system; Streaming applications; Traffic management; Two-step approach; Win-win solutions; Graphic methods",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85053930418

An alternative to this is event-based summaries. Directional changes (DC), which is a new event-based summary method, allows for new regularities in data to be discovered and exploited, as part of trading strategies. Under this paradigm, the timeline is divided in directional change events (upwards or downwards), and overshoot events, which follow exactly after a directional change has been identified. Previous work has shown that the duration of overshoot events is on average twice the duration of a DC event. However, this was empirically observed on the specific currency pairs DC was tested with, and only under the specific time periods the tests took place. Thus, this observation is not easily generalised. In this paper, we build on this regularity, by creating a new event-based indicator. We do this by calculating the average duration time of overshoot events on each training set of each individual dataset we experiment with. This allows us to have tailored duration values for each dataset. Such knowledge is important, because it allows us to more accurately anticipate trend reversal. In order to take advantage of this new indicator, we use a genetic algorithm to combine different DC trading strategies, which use our proposed indicator as part of their decision-making process. We experiment on 5 different foreign exchange currency pairs, for a total of 50 datasets. Our results show that the proposed algorithm is able to outperform its predecessor, as well as other well-known financial benchmarks, such as a technical analysis. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Algorithmic trading; Directional changes; Financial forecasting; Genetic algorithms","Commerce; Decision making; Economics; Finance; Genetic algorithms; Algorithmic trading; Decision making process; Directional changes; Financial forecasting; Forecasting methods; Price fluctuation; Technical analysis; Trading strategies; Electronic trading",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85034235848

We show that when controlling for pre-scheduled market news events, trade-time returns of the near-month E-mini S&P 500 futures contract are well characterized by a Gaussian distribution at very fine time scales. Second, we develop a structured and parsimonious model of clock-time returns using a time-changed Brownian motion composed with a general, non-Lévy directing process. Particular cases of this model allow for leptokurtosis and volatility clustering in clock-time returns, even when trade-time returns are Gaussian. Finally, we highlight conditions for the directing process which are required in order to generate proper volatility dynamics while simultaneously matching the unconditional distribution of returns. In-sample fitting and out-of-sample realized volatility forecasting demonstrate the strength of our model relative to leading candidates. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","High-frequency trading; News arrival; US equities",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84994845870

To this end, we introduce investors with different investment horizons into the news-driven, analytic, agent-based market model developed in Gusev et al. [Algo. Finance, 2015, 4, 5–51]. This heterogeneous framework enables us to capture dynamics at multiple timescales, expanding the model’s applications and improving precision. We study the heterogeneous model theoretically and empirically to highlight essential mechanisms underlying certain market behaviours, such as transitions between bull and bear markets and the self-similar behaviour of price changes. Most importantly, we apply this model to show that the stock market is nearly efficient on intraday timescales, adjusting quickly to incoming news, but becomes inefficient on longer timescales, where news may have a long-lasting nonlinear impact on dynamics, attributable to a feedback mechanism acting over these horizons. Then, using the model, we design algorithmic strategies that utilize news flow, quantified and measured, as the only input to trade on market return forecasts over multiple horizons, from days to months. The backtested results suggest that the return is predictable to the extent that successful trading strategies can be constructed to harness this predictability. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Agent-based models; Algorithmic trading; Dynamical systems; Ising; Market efficiency; News analytics; News-based strategies; Price feedback; Regime transitions; Return predictability; Self-similar behaviour; Sentiment evolution; Stock market dynamics; Synchronization",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84969799164

Technical analysis has been widely used in the real stock market to forecast stock price or stock trading points. The good association of technical indicators can obtain good prediction results in stock markets. But the selection of technical indicators is also a tough problem. In this paper, we introduce a forecasting model incorporating biclustering algorithm with a new fuzzy inference method. Biclustering algorithm discover biclusters which are regarded as trading patterns. And a new fuzzy inference method is used for determining trading points.

However, optimal technical trading rules alone may not be sufficient for real-world application given the endlessly changing futures market. In this study, a rule change trading system (RCTS) that consists of numerous trading rules generated using rough set analysis is developed in order to cover diverse market conditions. To change the trading rules, a rule change mechanism based on previous trading results is proposed. Simultaneously, a genetic algorithm is employed with the objective function of maximizing the payoff ratio to determine the thresholds of market timing for both buying and selling in the futures market. An empirical study of the proposed system was conducted in the Korea Composite Stock Price Index 200 (KOSPI 200) futures market.

In this paper, I discuss how and why the Flash Crash is being invoked as a significant event in debates about high-frequency trading and algo-financial markets. I analyse the mediatization of the event, as well as the variety of eventalizations of the Flash Crash - the different ways in which the Flash Crash is being mobilized as an illustrative event. I critically discuss the impact often associated with the Flash Crash–and on that basis, inquire into why the event nonetheless attracts so much attention. I suggest that a key reason why the Flash Crash is widely discussed is that eventalizations of 6 May 2010 evoke familiar tropes about the fear of technology and the fear of herding. Finally, and given their emphasis on herding, I argue that the Flash Crash eventalizations may contribute to discussions within economic sociology about resonance in quantitative finance. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","events; Flash Crash; Gabriel Tarde; herding; high-frequency trading; Émile Durkheim","algorithm; financial market; stock market; trade flow",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85009754037

Low Animal Spirits was a work made in collaboration with Richard Cochrane that took its cue from the oft-mentioned loss of the referent in both language and the economy that was speculated about wildly after the economic collapse of 2007/08. It employs a high-frequency trading (HFT) algorithm written by Cochrane (a former Vice President of Goldman Sachs), and ‘deals’ in words sourced from global news feeds for virtual ‘profit’, whilst speculating on their usage. The analysis produces new phenomena in the form of speculative headlines tweeted from the twitterbot @LowAnimalSpirit. As various social productions, including news, are increasingly enmeshed within algorithmic procedures, through their production, distribution and reception, it seemed an apt moment to apply an extreme version of algorithmic operation in the form of HFT to global news production. The Associated Press twitter hack of 2013 that brought about a 1% drop in the financial market in 1 minute was displayed during the exhibition as a polished metal graphic: Breaking News–Flash Crash, and generated further investigation into high-speed algorithmic procedures that seemingly conjoin language and the economy.

Skyline queries are a notable example. Their results consist of all the tuples whose attribute vector is not dominated (in the Pareto sense) by one of any other tuple. Because of their popularity, skyline queries have been studied in terms of both sequential algorithms and parallel implementations for multiprocessors and clusters. Within the Data Stream Processing paradigm, traditional database queries on static relations have been revised in order to operate on continuous data streams. Most of the past papers propose sequential algorithms for continuous skyline queries, whereas there exist very few works targeting implementations on parallel machines. This paper contributes to fill this gap by proposing a parallel implementation for multicore architectures. We propose (i) a parallelization of the eager algorithm based on the notion of Skyline Influence Time, (ii) optimizations of the reduce phase and load-balancing strategies to achieve near-optimal speedup, and (iii) a set of experiments with both synthetic benchmarks and a real dataset in order to show our implementation effectiveness.

Whilst many former studies comparing type-1 and type-2 Fuzzy Logic Systems (FLSs) focus on error reduction or market direction accuracy, our interest is predominantly risk-adjusted performance and more in line with both trading practitioners and upcoming regulatory regimes. We propose an innovative approach to design an interval type-2 model which is based on a generalisation of the popular type-1 ANFIS model. The significance of this work stems from the contributions as a result of introducing type-2 fuzzy sets in intelligent trading algorithms, with the objective to improve the risk-adjusted performance with minimal increase in the design and computational complexity. Overall, the proposed ANFIS/T2 model scores significant performance improvements when compared to both standard ANFIS and Buy-and-Hold methods. As a further step, we identify a relationship between the increased trading performance benefits of the proposed type-2 model and higher levels of microstructure noise. The results resolve a desirable need for practitioners, researchers and regulators in the design of expert and intelligent systems for better management of risk in the field of HFT. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

This study aims to provide a baseline understanding of the effect of HFT on markets by using a paradigm of zero-intelligence traders and examining the resulting structural changes. Design/methodology/approach-A continuous double auction setting with zero-intelligence traders is used by adapting the model of Gode and Sunder (1993) to include algorithmic high frequency (HF) traders who retrade by marking up their shares by a fixed percentage. The simulation examines the effects of two independent factors, the number of HF traders and their markup percentage, on several dependent variables, principally volume, market efficiency, trader surplus and volatility. Results of the simulations are tested with two-way ANOVA and Tukey's post hoc tests. Findings-In the simulation results, trading volume, efficiency and total surplus vary directly with the number of traders employing HFT. Results also reveal that market volatility increased with the number of HF traders. Research limitations/implications-Increases in volume, efficiency and total surplus represent market improvements due to the trading activities of HF traders. However, the increase in volatility is worrisome, and some of the surplus increase appears to come at the expense of long-term-oriented investors. However, the relatively recent development of HFT and dearth of appropriate data make direct calibration of any model difficult. Originality/value-The simulation study focuses on the structural impact of HF traders on several aspects of the simulated market, with the effects isolated from other noise and problems with empirical data.

In order to realize such real-time trading systems, multi-/many-core processors are required. However, real-time trading systems are somewhat complex, and real-time operating systems struggle to offer continuous support because of their customization, robustness, maintainability, and portability compared with real-time middleware. An imprecise computation model is employed to support these trading systems, and semi-fixed-priority scheduling is a representative imprecise real-time scheduling technique for multi-/many-core processors. Unfortunately, there is no real-time middleware that supports semi-fixed-priority scheduling. This paper presents the RT-Seed real-time middleware, which implements a semi-fixed-priority scheduling algorithm, called Partitioned Rate Monotonic with Wind-up Part (P-RMWP), on Linux. P-RMWP supports the parallel-extended imprecise computation model that executes optional parts in parallel, called parallel optional parts. This paper also describes how to terminate parallel optional parts in the user space.

As time goes by, the trader learns from changes in prices and updates their predictions to tweak their strategy. Compared to a trader who cannot learn from market dynamics or from a view of the market, the algorithmic trader's profits are higher and more certain. Even though the trader executes a strategy based on a directional view, the sources of profits are both from making the spread as well as capital appreciation of inventories. Higher volatility of prices considerably impairs the trader's ability to learn from price innovations, but this adverse effect can be circumvented by learning from a collection of assets that comove.

Parameter estimation both under the static and dynamic settings are carried out as well as in the models used as benchmarks in a comparative analysis. Implementation details are provided. We include a numerical illustration of the methodology applied to the currency data on UK sterling pounds and US dollars both against the Japanese yen. Our empirical results demonstrate greater fitting capacity and forecasting power of the zero-delay HMM over the comparators included in our analysis. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Offer and demand of liquidity drives price formation and traders anticipate future evolutions of the orderbook. The natural framework we use is mean field game theory, a class of stochastic differential games with a continuum of anonymous players. Several sources of heterogeneity are considered including the mean size of orders. Thus we are able to consider the coexistence of Institutional Investors and high frequency traders (HFT). We provide both analytical solutions and numerical experiments. Implications on classical quantities are explored: orderbook size, prices, and effective bid/ask spread. According to the model, in markets with Institutional Investors only we show the existence of inefficient liquidity imbalances in equilibrium, with two symmetrical situations corresponding to what we call liquidity calls for liquidity. During these situations the transaction price significantly moves away from the fair price. However this macro phenomenon disappears in markets with both Institutional Investors and HFT, although a more precise study shows that the benefits of the new situation go to HFT only, leaving Institutional Investors even with higher trading costs. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","High frequency trading; Liquidity equilibrium; Market microstructure; Mean field games; Order-driven market; Orderbook modeling; Price formation process; Waiting cost",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84946112935

To answer this question, the significant cycles were discovered using the Fourier analysis inside the price series of US stocks; then, the simulation of an agent buying and selling on minima and maxima of these cycles was made. The results were then compared to those of an agent operating chaotically. Moreover, the existing significant cycles were found using more precise methods, suggested in the research, and based on the results of an agent buying and selling on all possible periods and phases. It has been analysed whether these really existing cycles were in accordance with the significant cycles resulting from the Fourier analysis. It has been concluded that the Fourier analysis basically failed. Suchlike failures are expected on similar data series. In addition, momentum and level trading backtests have been used in a similar way.

Finally, we find that the period since the introduction of algorithmic trading (AT) has seen increases in both the variances and covariances of return volatility in most industries.

The establishment of a national market system and Regulation NMS was meant to promote competition, recognizing the evolution and changing dynamics introduced by technological innovation. This evolution and governing rule set has had many positive effects in terms of competition, fee compression, tighter spread potential and volumes. Our paper identifies certain unintended consequences and complexities of the national market system including fragmentation, sub second quoting and trading, complex order types, data asymmetry, technological innovation, unique strategies and the algorithms that power them. When acting in concert, these complexities give rise to opportunities as well as emerging risks. This high-speed system can be unstable and susceptible to inherent conflicts of interest, market abuse and price shocks. These shocks can be amplified by positive feedback loops accelerating single stock declines and also posing systemic risks in time scales beyond real-time physical human comprehension and reaction times. Furthermore they can produce contagion, which we refer to as 'Flash Splashes' caused by rapid withdrawals and injections of liquidity in increasingly linked asset classes, indices, sectors and global liquidity pools. High frequency trading strategies can be both passive and aggressive and usually display risk averse and low inventory characteristics. These strategies leverage fragmentation as they create or capture informational asymmetries. They interact directly with sell side algorithms that can hide intentions, hunt liquidity and sweep the order book. These interactions create market dynamics that can benefit and challenge anyone exposed to US equity markets. Every market participant has a risk profile unique to their strategy and objective and while regulations will be enriched or revised and certain unfair practices eliminated great attention should be paid to understanding modern high speed trading risks and both the positive and negative impacts on all stakeholders. We have examined the regulations, complexities and risks to bring clarity and understanding to the current trading ecosystem for its users.

In the present paper, we examine returns for a number of FTSE 100 and AIM stocks and indices based on maximising the Tsallis entropy. This framework allows us to show how the distributions evolve and scale over time. Classical theory dictates that if markets are efficient then the time variant parameter of the Tsallis distribution should scale with a power equal to 1, or normal diffusion. We find that for the majority of securities and indices examined, the Tsallis time variant parameter is scaled with super diffusion of greater than 1.

HFT is often discussed as a purely technological development, where all that matters is the speed of allocating, processing and transmitting data. Indeed, the speed at which trades are executed and data transmitted is accelerating, and it is fair to say that algorithms are now the primary interacting agents operating in the financial markets. However, we contend that HFT is first and foremost a cultural phenomenon. More specifically, both individuals and collective agents – such as algorithms – might be considered cultural entities, charged with very different ways of processing information, making sense of it and turning it into knowledge and practice.

The focus of the paper is on the relation between imitation and ignorance within the organizational structure of high-frequency trading (HFT) firms. In social studies of finance (SSF) literature imitation is considered a strategic act, i.e. imitation is a term applied when traders copy the strategies of other traders. I wish to turn this relation between ignorance and imitation on its head and consider ignorance itself as a strategic unknown and investigate the kinds of imitations that might be produced from structures of not-knowing (i.e. structures intended to divide, obscure and protect knowledge). This point is illustrated through ethnographic studies and interviews within five HFT firms. The data show how a black-box structure of ignorance is replicated within the organizational setting of these firms and re-enacted by the traders. Towards the end of the paper the politics of the relationship between imitation and ignorance is discussed. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","black box; high-frequency trading; ignorance; imitation; organizational structure; social studies of finance","algorithm; economic analysis; financial market; political economy; strategic approach; trade",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84988410225

Fifteen interviews with stakeholders in the Act’s implementation serve to reconstruct how regulators defined an algorithm and help pose the question of to what extent regulatory definitions and data need accurately to represent financial practices to be useful. Although tentative in its findings, the research suggests that the algorithm-tagging rule may be providing valuable signals in the noise to trade surveillance officers and having virtuous effects on the cultures of trading firms.

In the field of high-frequency trading (HFT), suggested solutions have involved a call for increased market information, for example, or better access to the inner workings of algorithmic trading systems. Through a combination of fieldwork conducted in HFT firms and discourse analysis, I show that the problem may not always stem from a lack of information. Instead, my comparative analysis of different market actors (regulators, market analysts and traders) shows that the diverse and complex ways in which they access and construct knowledge out of information in fact lead to what I call different epistemic regimes. An understanding of how epistemic regimes work will enable us to explain not only why the same market event can be viewed as very different things – as market manipulation, predation or error – but also why it is so difficult to arrive at a unified theory or view of HFT. The comparative perspective introduced by the idea of epistemic regimes might also serve as a starting point for the development of a cultural approach to the study of financial markets. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","epistemic regimes; Flash Crash; HFT; market manipulation; predation","accountability; financial market; information technology; knowledge; regulatory framework; view",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84988422286

A Wiener-Hopf argument allows one to prove that this system (in which the kernel matrix is the unknown) possesses a unique causal solution and consequently that the first- and second-order properties fully characterize a Hawkes process. The numerical inversion of this system of integral equations allows us to propose a fast and efficient method, which main principles were initially sketched by Bacry and Muzy, to perform a non-parametric estimation of the Hawkes kernel matrix. In this paper, we perform a systematic study of this non-parametric estimation procedure in the general framework of marked Hawkes processes. We precisely describe this procedure step by step. We discuss the estimation error and explain how the values for the main parameters should be chosen. Various numerical examples are given in order to illustrate the broad possibilities of this estimation procedure ranging from monovariate (power-law or non-positive kernels) up to three-variate (circular dependence) processes.

The investigated method is used to determine potential buy and sell conditions for stocks, aiming to yield robust solutions able to withstand extreme market conditions, while producing high returns at a minimal risk. One of the biggest challenges GP evolved solutions face is over-fitting. GP trading rules need to have similar performance when tested with new data in order to be deployed in a real situation. We explore a random sampling method (RSFGP) which instead of calculating the fitness over the whole dataset, calculates it on randomly selected segments. This method shows improved robustness and out-of-sample results compared to standard genetic programming (SGP) and a volatility adjusted fitness (VAFGP). Trading strategies (TS) are evolved using financial metrics like the volatility, CAPM alpha and beta, and the Sharpe ratio alongside other Technical Indicators (TI) to find the best investment strategy. These strategies are evaluated using 21 of the most liquid stocks of the Spanish market. The achieved results clearly outperform Buy&Hold, SGP and VAFGP. Additionally, the solutions obtained with the training data during the experiments clearly show during testing robustness to step market declines as seen during the European sovereign debt crisis experienced recently in Spain. In this paper the solutions learned were able to operate for prolonged periods, which demonstrated the validity and robustness of the rules learned, which are able to operate continuously and with minimal human intervention. To sum up, the developed method is able to evolve TSs suitable for all market conditions with promising results, which suggests great potential in the method generalization capabilities. The use of financial metrics alongside popular TI enables the system to increase the stock return while proving resilient through time. The RSFGP system is able to cope with different types of markets achieving a portfolio return of 31.81% for the testing period 2009-2013 in the Spanish market, having the IBEX35 index returned 2.67%. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Our main goal is to investigate whether high-frequency trading exacerbates market volatility and generates flash crashes. In the model, low-frequency agents adopt trading rules based on chronological time and can switch between fundamentalist and chartist strategies. By contrast, high-frequency traders activation is event-driven and depends on price fluctuations. High-frequency traders use directional strategies to exploit market information produced by low-frequency traders. Monte-Carlo simulations reveal that the model replicates the main stylized facts of financial markets. Furthermore, we find that the presence of high-frequency traders increases market volatility and plays a fundamental role in the generation of flash crashes. The emergence of flash crashes is explained by two salient characteristics of high-frequency traders, i.e., their ability to i. generate high bid-ask spreads and ii. synchronize on the sell side of the limit order book. Finally, we find that higher rates of order cancellation by high-frequency traders increase the incidence of flash crashes but reduce their duration. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Agent-based models; Flash crashes; High-frequency trading; Limit order book; Low-frequency trading; Market volatility",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84939237003

First, the presented trading strategy appears very lucrative in the Black–Scholes–Merton (BSM) framework. In fact, to such an extent that the BSM model turns out to be, in a sense, incompatible with the CAPM. Second, if one wishes to adapt these models together, then the adjustment of the consistent pricing rule (i.e. modifying state price densities) inevitably leads to some form of volatility smile, which is the main point of the paper. Moreover, these observations arise from purely structural considerations and only one hypothetical equity or equity index with many European options on it (such as S&P500) is required. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Black–Scholes; CAPM; Compatibility of valuation models; High-frequency trading; Sharpe ratio; State price density; Volatility smile",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84958747455

Elasticity allows applications to rapidly change their configuration on-the-fly (e.g., the amount of used resources) in response to dynamic workload fluctuations. In this work we face this problem by adopting the Model Predictive Control technique, a control-theoretic method aimed at finding the optimal application configuration along a limited prediction hori-zon in the future by solving an online optimization problem. Our control strategies are designed to address latency constraints, using Queueing Theory models, and energy consumption by changing the number of used cores and the CPU frequency through the Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) support available in the modern multicore CPUs. The proactive capabilities, in addition to the latency-and energy-awareness, represent the novel features of our approach. To validate our methodology, we develop a thorough set of experiments on a high-frequency trading application.

The in memory database (IMDB) eliminates the I/O bottleneck by storing data in main memory. We give a deeper analysis of current main-stream IMDB systems performance which focuses on the data structure, architecture, volume, concurrency, availability and scalability. The V3 performance model is proposed to evaluate the Velocity, Volume and Varity of the 19 IMDB systems, in order to highlight the candidates with realtime transaction and high volume processing capacity coordinately. Test results clearly demonstrate that NewSQL is better at dealing with high-frequency trading models. To fully utilize the advantages of the multi-core and many-core processors capability improvements, a three-level optimization design strategy, which includes the memory-access level, the kernel-speedup level and the data-partition level also be proposed using the hardware parallelism for achieving task-level and data-level parallelism of IMDB programs, guarantees the IMDB could accelerate the real-time transaction in an efficient way.

This paper is focused on testing the relationship between market liquidity of shares traded on Frankfurt Stock Exchange and HFT activity on European stock markets. Author proposes own methodology for measuring dynamics in HFT activity, without knowledge of original market messages. Liquidity is measured by various from of price spreads. Econometrical methods for panel regression are used to determine these relations.

Since the market's job is, at least in part, price discovery, we argue that simplicity of regulation and restraint in regulation are virtues to a greater extent than in other areas of finance.

The global financial sector has already developed into a comprehensive network of mutually connected people and computers that are constantly evaluating and approving millions of transactions. Algorithms play a crucial role within this global financial network. An algorithm is in essence merely a set of instructions developed by one or more people with the intention of having these instructions performed by a machine such as a computer, a software robot or a physical robot in order to realize an ideal result. As part of a development in which we as human beings have ever higher expectations of algorithms and these algorithms become ever more autonomous in their actions, we cannot avoid including possibilities in these algorithms that enable ethical or more considerations. To develop this ethical or moral consideration, we need a kind of ethical framework which can be used for developing algorithms. With the development of such a framework we can start to think about what we as human beings consider to be moral action by machines within the financial sector based on such a framework.

It has been shown in the past that high Sharpe ratio strategies tend to perform better in out-of-sample periods. As the benchmark method, we use an equally weighted (1/N, naïve) portfolio.

Our goal is to improve the robustness of a SVR based algorithm trading model for short term trades. Robustness of a trading model means that the profit curve of the model has low volatility without sudden sizable ups and downs. (1) Firstly, we carefully craft some features for prediction of stock price in short term future, based on commonly used indicators to capture typical price movement patterns, overbought/oversold, and divergence situations. The features are normalized before being used to train the SVR based trading model to generalize the model to all stocks. (2) Secondly, we design a portfolio diversifying method based on the trading model. Correlations between stocks in a portfolio can compromise profitability of an algorithm trading model. Prices of stocks with strong correlations move in the same direction. If the trading model predicts price movement in the wrong direction, stop loss will be triggered and these stocks will cause loss in a mutual accelerated manner. We propose a method to improve diversity of the portfolio. Stocks are clustered into different groups using a similarity measure based on historical performances of the trading model on the stocks, and the portfolio is built by selecting stocks from different groups. (3) Experimental results show that our trading model can earn an excess return compared to risk free fixed savings. And the volatility of the profit curve of the trading model is reduced, which means that robustness of the trading model is improved. © 2016 IEEE.","Algorithm trading; Feature crafting; Portfolio diversifying; Robustness; Support vector regression (SVR)","Big data; Commerce; Costs; Data privacy; Financial markets; Profitability; Robustness (control systems); Algorithm trading; Feature crafting; Historical performance; Portfolio diversifying; Similarity measure; Strong correlation; Support vector regression (SVR); Trading models; Electronic trading",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85015197641

Today shares shift hands within microseconds, giving rise to a form of financial geographies termed algorithmic capitalism. This notion refers to the different spatio-temporalities produced by high frequency trading, under the valuation of time. As high frequency trading accelerates financial markets, the paper examines the spatio-temporalities of automated trading by the ways in which the speed of knowledge exploitation in financial markets is not only of interest, but also the expansion between different temporalities. The paper demonstrates how the intensification of time-space compression produces radical new dynamics in the financial market and develops information rent in HFT as convertible to a time rent and a spatio-temporal rent. The final section discusses whether high frequency trading only responds to crises in microseconds or constitutes them. It argues that automated trading will not only contribute to accelerate crises, but also deepen them by the ways in which it differentiates the dynamics between financial, fixed and productive capital. © 2015 .","Crises; Geographies of finance; High frequency trading; Microseconds; Space-time compression; Spaces of timing; Time-rent neoliberalism","capitalism; financial crisis; financial market; neoliberalism; trade",Review,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84948783395

The proposed DNB allows simultaneously to represent expert knowledge of skilled traders in a model structure and to learn computationally from data information that reflects relevant market sentiment dynamics. The DBN is derived from a Hierarchical Hidden Markov Model (HHMM) that incorporates expert knowledge in its design and learns the trend patterns present in the market data. The wavelet representation is used to produce compact representations of the LOB liquidity dynamics that simultaneously reduces the time complexity of the computational learning and improves its precision. In previous works, this trading strategy has been shown to be competitive when compared with conventional techniques. However, these works failed to control for unwanted dependencies in the return series used for training and testing that may have skewed performance results to the positive side. This paper constructs key trading strategy estimators based on the Random Entry Protocol over the USD-COP data. This technique eliminates unwanted dependencies on returns and order flow while keeps the natural autocorrelation structure of the LimitOrder Book (LOB). It is still concluded that the HHMM-based model results are competitive with a positive, statistically significant P/L and a well-understood risk profile.

One natural question, which has begun to spur the development of new models, is the effect of competition between platforms that use these two different mechanisms when agents can strategize over platform choice. In this paper we contribute to this nascent literature by developing an agent-based model of competition between a Call market and a CDA market. Our model incorporates patient informed traders (both high-frequency and not) who are willing to wait for order execution at their preferred price and impatient background traders who demand immediate execution. We show that there is a strong tendency for the Call market to absorb a significant fraction of trade under most equilibrium and approximate-equilibrium conditions. These equilibria typically lead to significantly higher welfare for the background traders, an important measure of social value, than the operation of an isolated CDA market.

We employ a simple model of latency arbitrage in which a single security is traded on two exchanges, with price quotes available to regular traders only after some delay. An infinitely fast arbitrageur reaps profits when the two markets diverge due to this latency in cross-market communication. Using an agent-based approach, we simulate interactions between high-frequency and zero-intelligence trading agents. From simulation data over a large space of strategy combinations, we estimate game models and compute strategic equilibria in a variety of market environments. We then evaluate allocative efficiency and market liquidity in equilibrium, and we find that market fragmentation and the presence of a latency arbitrageur reduces total surplus and negatively impacts liquidity.

In the light of this, this paper formulates DC event approach into three automated trading strategies for investments in the FMs: ZI-Directional Change Trading (DCT0), DCT1, and DCT2.

The central idea of the proposed system architecture is decomposing the trading problem into a set of tasks that are handled by distributed autonomous agents under a minimal central coordination. With this kind of architecture, we can take advantage of currently available and future high-performance computing systems. These systems, due to the way computer architecture has evolved in the recent past and foreseeable future, are composed of multiple processor cores. We are implementing the ITA software architecture employing the Carnegie Mellon Navigation (CARMEN) robot control software and using a publish/subscribe communication model. Together, CARMEN and this communication model allow the implementation of high-performance, scalable parallel computing systems that leverage the architecture of multi-core systems. For this work, we evaluated the data structures and algorithms employed by the symbol module of the ITA software architecture, which is responsible for maintaining the synchronized local copies of exchanges limit order books (LOB) for the instruments traded by the system. Our LOB implementation strongly outperformed a reference implementation in all evaluated parameters by more than one order of magnitude in some cases, achieving average throughputs of 4 million orders/s when creating new orders, 3 million orders/s when changing existing orders, and 17 million orders/s when querying orders.

The aim of this research is to create such models which can be used for creating automatic trading strategies that will beat the market. Reliability of these models is being checked in three highly liquid shares from Prague Stock O2, CEZ and KB in seven years long period in years 2006–2012. We used Markov chain analysis for modelling. In our models a state space is defined on the basis of cumulative daily changes of share price and a state space with eight states is used. The state space is defined parametrically as a multiple of standard deviation of daily yields for each share. There were 14 parameters calculated in total and for each parameter nine trading strategies for all shares were applied. It means that 378 trading strategies were calculated. We succeeded in finding a set of compact state space models and in applying a compact group of trading strategies on these models which always beat the market when invested in portfolio. The average annual market yield was 3.6%. The average yield of our portfolios oscillates between 4.7% and 14.8%. Strategies overcame the market also even after including transaction costs. After including transaction costs in amount of 0.1% from the trade volume a decrease of average annual yields would occur in the range from 0.45 to 2.1 percentage points. We reached the best results in the sideway trend and in shares with less changing volatility. Conclusions of this research are in contradiction to the Efficient Market Hypothesis.

Today, these major profits are driving the pioneers of the financial practitioners to develop and deploy the big data solutions in financial products, ranging from front-office algorithmic trading to back-office data management and analytics. Not only the collection and purification of multi-source data, the effective visualization of high-throughput data streams and rapid programmability on massively parallel processing architectures are widely used to facilitate the algorithmic trading and research. Big data analytics can help reveal more hidden market opportunities through analyzing high-volume structured data and social news, in contrast to the underperformers that are incapable of adopting novel techniques. Being able to process massive complex events in ultra-fast speed removes the roadblock for promptly capturing market trends and timely managing risks. These key trends in capital markets and extensive examples in quantitative finance are systematically highlighted in this chapter.

However, the cost of the parallelization process of existing applications is still too high in terms of time-to-development, and often requires a large effort and expertise by the programmer. The REPARA methodology consists in a systematic way to express parallel patterns by annotating the source code using C++11 attributes transformed automatically in a target parallel code based on parallel programming libraries (e.g. FastFlow, Intel TBB). In this paper we apply this approach in the parallelization of a real high-frequency trading application. The description shows the effectiveness of the approach in easily prototyping several parallel variants of the same code. We also propose an extension of a REPARA attribute to express a user-defined scheduling strategy, which makes it possible to design a high-throughput and low-latency parallelization of our code outperforming the other parallel variants in most of the considered test-cases. © 2015 IEEE.","C++11 Attributes; Data Stream Processing; FastFlow; High-Frequency Trading; Parallel Patterns; REPARA","Codes (symbols); Commerce; Computer programming; Data handling; Electronic trading; Multimedia services; Parallel architectures; Parallel programming; Data stream processing; Fastflow; High-frequency trading; Parallel patterns; REPARA; C (programming language)",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84969145319

It is a bedrock assumption in theory that securities prices reveal how effectively public companies utilize capital. This conventional wisdom rests on the straightforward premise that prices reflect available information about a security and that investors look to prices to decide where to invest and whether their capital is being productively used. Unsurprisingly, regulation relies pervasively on prices as a proxy for the allocative efficiency of investor capital. Algorithmic trading weakens the ability of prices to function as a window into allocative efficiency. This Article develops two lines of argument. First, algorithmic markets evidence a systemic degree of model risk - the risk that stylized programming and financial modeling fails to capture the messy details of real-world trading. By design, algorithms rely on pre-set programming and modeling to function. Traders must predict how markets might behave and program their algorithms accordingly in advance of trading, and this anticipatory dynamic creates steep costs. Building algorithms capable of predicting future markets presents a near-impossible proposition, making gaps and errors inevitable. These uncertainties create incentives for traders to focus efforts on markets where prediction is likely to be most successful, i.e., short-term markets that have limited relevance for capital allocation. Secondly, informed traders, long regarded as critical to filling gaps in information and supplying markets with insight, have fewer incentives to participate in algorithmic markets and to correct these and other informational deficits. Competing with high-speed, algorithmic counterparts, informed traders can see lower returns from their engagement. When informed traders lose interest in bringing insights to securities trading, prices are less rich as a result. This argument has significant implications for regulation that views prices as providing an essential window into allocative efficiency. Broad swaths of regulation across corporate governance and securities regulation rely on prices as a mechanism to monitor and discipline public companies. As algorithmic trading creates costs for capital allocation, this reliance must also be called into question. In concluding, this Article outlines pathways for reform to better enable securities markets to fulfill their fundamental purpose: efficiently allocating capital to the real economy.",,,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84961324257

Understanding technological innovations in financial information systems (IS) and technologies has been challenging for technology consultants and financial industry practitioners due to the underlying complexities though. In this article, we propose an ecosystem analysis approach by extending the technology ecosystem paths of influence model (Adomavicius et al., 2008a) to incorporate stakeholder actions, considering both supply-side and demand-side forces for technological change. Our ecosystem model brings together three original core elements: technology components, technology-based services, and technology-supported business infrastructures. We also contribute a fourth new element to this approach involving stakeholder analysis. We investigate innovations in the area of high-frequency trading (HFT) technologies as a basis for empirically validating the existence of several different patterns in the historical path of technology evolution. Our analysis results suggest that supply-side and demand-side forces influenced HFT technology innovations and contributed to changes in the financial markets.

The associated 'technological arms race' has created a new market ecology which has made trading cheaper and faster but more volatile and fragmented. This paper charts the technological roots of this transformation from a conventional measurement of innovation perspective. We do so by employing content analysis techniques and extracting market infrastructure patent counts from the USPTO (United States Patent and Trademark Office) database for the period January 1976 to October 2013. From the resulting time series and a qualitative examination of patents we find that (1) the number of market infrastructure patents has dramatically increased since 1999, as confirmed by an associated structural break; (2) the new market ecology has, in true Schumpeterian style, been associated with a new breed of firms, most notably software firms and historically smaller brokerage firms that have invested heavily in technology internally and through strategic acquisitions; and (3) some incumbent firms have responded aggressively to the new market ecology, most notably the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and Goldman Sachs. We conclude that policymakers, regulators and academics wishing to further investigate the technological roots of recent changes in capital should refer to patent data. Our principal contribution is to highlight that Wall Street has been actively patenting market infrastructure innovations in a pattern consistent with claims that an associated 'technological arms race' started in the late 1990s. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","Capital markets; Financial innovation; High frequency trading; Patents","Commerce; Ecology; Financial markets; Investments; Capital markets; Conventional measurements; Financial innovation; High-frequency trading; Market infrastructure; Patents; Strategic acquisitions; United States Patent and Trademark Office; Patents and inventions; capital; financial market; infrastructure; innovation; Chicago; Illinois; United States",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84947017156

Technologically induced innovations such as electronic exchanges, high frequency trading (HFT) and exchange traded funds (ETFs) have made trading in capital markets faster, cheaper and more integrated, yet at the same timemarket liquidity has become more fragmented and opaque. Further, there are concerns that this new paradigmleads to greater volatility and myopia in the core function of finance (raising capital for entrepreneurial activity). Capital markets are clearly complex adaptive techno-social systems that are undergoing dramatic changes yet they are rarely researched from an innovation research or technological change perspective. In this editorial, we introduce the themes and issues highlighted by the papers in this Special Issue that addresses this gap in the literature. The contributions illuminate the technologies and related innovations that are changing the nature of capital markets. However, technology cannot be seen in isolation fromother forces, most notably regulation, organisational innovation and new entrants.Moreover, technology is not only changing existingmarkets, it is expanding the scope of markets. Thuswe conclude that financialization (the process bywhich financialmarkets become increasingly important in the economy and society) is a technology enabled phenomenon-something hitherto largely overlooked by the financialization literature. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.",,"Electronic trading; Financial markets; Core functions; Economy and society; Entrepreneurial activity; Exchange-traded funds; High-frequency trading; Innovation research; Organisational innovations; Technological change; Commerce; capital; financial market; financial system; innovation; technological change",Editorial,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84947042186

This allows us to derive insights into the principles behind the profitability of our trading strategies. We illustrate our approach through the analysis of Bitcoin, a cryptocurrency known for its large price fluctuations. In our analysis, we include economic signals of volume and price of exchange for USD, adoption of the Bitcoin technology and transaction volume of Bitcoin. We add social signals related to information search, word of mouth volume, emotional valence and opinion polarization as expressed in tweets related to Bitcoin for more than 3 years. Our analysis reveals that increases in opinion polarization and exchange volume precede rising Bitcoin prices, and that emotional valence precedes opinion polarization and rising exchange volumes. We apply these insights to design algorithmic trading strategies for Bitcoin, reaching very high profits in less than a year. We verify this high profitability with robust statistical methods that take into account risk and trading costs, confirming the long-standing hypothesis that trading-based social media sentiment has the potential to yield positive returns on investment. © 2015 The Authors.","Algorithmic trading; Bitcoin; Computational social science; Polarization; Prediction; Sentiment",,Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84958073389

Therefore, this paper aims to provide the first systematic literature review on the state-of-the-art application of EC techniques for rule discovery in stock AT. Out of 650 articles published before 2013 (inclusive), 51 relevant articles from 24 journals were confirmed. These papers were reviewed and grouped into three analytical method categories (fundamental analysis, technical analysis, and blending analysis) and three EC technique categories (evolutionary algorithm, swarm intelligence, and hybrid EC techniques). A significant bias toward the applications of genetic algorithm-based (GA) and genetic programming-based (GP) techniques in technical trading rule discovery is observed. Other EC techniques and fundamental analysis lack sufficient study. Furthermore, we summarize the information on the evaluation scheme of selected papers and particularly analyze the researches which compare their models with buy and hold strategy (B&H). We observe an interesting phenomenon where most of the existing techniques perform effectively in the downtrend and poorly in the uptrend, and considering the distribution of research in the classification framework, we suggest that this phenomenon can be attributed to the inclination of factor selections and problem in transaction cost selections. We also observe the significant influence of the transaction cost change on the margins of excess return. Other influenced factors are also presented in detail. The absence of ways for market trend prediction and the selection of transaction cost are two major limitations of the studies reviewed. In addition, the combination of trading rule discovery techniques and portfolio selection is a major research gap.

Recently, automated prediction markets where software trading agents perform market operations such as trading and updating beliefs on behalf of humans have been proposed. A challenging aspect in automated prediction markets is to develop suitable techniques that can be used by automated trading agents to update the price at which they should trade securities related to an event so that they can increase their profit. This problem is nontrivial, as the decision to trade and the price at which trading should occur depends on several dynamic factors, such as incoming information related to the event for which the security is being traded, the belief-update mechanism and risk attitude of the trading agent, and the trading decision and trading prices of other agents. To address this problem, we have proposed a new behavior model for trading agents based on a game-theoretic framework called partially observable stochastic game with information (POSGI). We propose a correlated equilibrium (CE)-based solution strategy for this game that allows each agent to dynamically choose an action (to buy or sell or hold) in the prediction market. We have also performed extensive simulation experiments using the data obtained from the Intrade prediction market for four different prediction markets. Our results show that our POSGI model and CE strategy produces prices that are strongly correlated with the prices of the real prediction markets. Results comparing our CE strategy with five other strategies commonly used in similar market show that our CE strategy improves price predictions and provides higher utilities to the agents compared to other existing strategies. © 2015 ACM 2157-6904/2015/07-ART48 $15.00.","Correlated equilibrium; Prediction market; Risk-averse traders; Stochastic game","Automation; Computation theory; Costs; Forecasting; Game theory; Software agents; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Automated trading; Correlated equilibria; Distributed information; Extensive simulations; Market-based mechanisms; Prediction markets; Risk averse; Stochastic game; Commerce",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84939799624

The universal strategy makes decisions based on the forecasts of future prices of financial instruments with the help of the randomized algorithm for computing well-calibrated forecasts in Dawid’s sense.

Moreover, the complexity of the applications is continuously growing, and the amount of the information about components is becoming too large to be handled by human intermediaries. Therefore, automated trading of components will play a critical role in CBD. This chapter underlines the need of linking three areas of the COTS CBD: the documentation and specification of COTS components, the description of COTS-based software architectures, and the trading processes for COTS components.

Further, the influence of news arrival, and liquidity (volatility) shocks on the deviations persists for several hours. Finally, we document significant decline (by at least 80%) in the deviations between 1998 and 2010.

Usually, the variance of the execution cost is taken as a proxy of risk due to mathematical tractability. However, the variance has been recognized not to be practical since it is a symmetric measure of risk and, hence, penalizes the low-cost events. In this paper, we propose the use of the conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) of the execution cost as risk measure, which allows to take into consideration only the unfavorable part of the return distribution, or, equivalently, unwanted high cost. In addition, due to the parameter estimation errors in the price model, the naive strategies given by the nominal problem may perform badly in the real market, and hence it is extremely important to take such parameters estimation errors into consideration. To deal with this, we extend both the traditional mean-variance approach and our proposed CVaR approach to their robust design counterparts. © 1991-2012 IEEE.","Conditional value-at-risk; convex optimization; order execution; robust optimization","Algorithms; Convex optimization; Costs; Economic and social effects; Errors; Estimation; Optimization; Risks; Value engineering; Algorithmic trading; Conditional Value-at-Risk; Mathematical tractability; Mean-variance approach; order execution; Parameter estimation errors; Parameters estimation; Robust optimization; Risk assessment",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84921849140

One argument against HFT is that it is a license to print money that is owned by a minority of market participants. We argue that there is no reason why HFT is particularly profitable and that the shortness of the holding period is not necessarily conducive to the generation of super profit. We examine the relation between the holding period and profitability by calculating the profit generated from carry trade operations in the foreign exchange market with a wide range of holding periods. In this analysis, we avoid the confusion between high-frequency trading and automated trading and define HFT only in terms of the holding period and the frequency of trading. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Across various currency pairs in 2010, the failure rate of market orders was approximately 60%. This high rate of market-order execution failures cannot be observed in 2003-2004. By fully examining the EBS order-by-order database, we provide vivid illustrations of behaviors observed in limit orders and market orders at high frequency. We find evidence that market orders in the EBS FX markets fail to be executed because (1) turnover of orders is too fast for a market order to hit a moving target and (2) market orders are not only being used in the traditional sense in which a trader is promised an immediate transaction but also being used for strategic trading. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

As introduced by Lehmann, in an information regime all the information is trade related, arrives via order flow, and the fundamental value that underlines the prices does not change, it is simply translated by the size of the executed market order and the backfilling adjustment. During an information regime the best quotes and the underlying values follow a path defined by the limit order book. This implies that algorithmic trading gains can be strengthened not only by identifying these information regimes but also by forecasting the transition periods between regimes that signal fundamental changes in assets' prices, trading behavior, and optimal trading strategies. Our results show that the discovery and identification of information regimes essentially uncover the mechanism by which latent demands are translated into realized prices and volumes and, from here, that they can be used by professional traders. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Three variants of four common trading rules are tested (moving averages, filter rules, Bollinger bands, and breakouts). The results suggest that the VIX is not a useful indicator for technical trading profitability at high frequencies regardless of the volatility regime. The S&P 500 Index data are shown to generate profitable trading signals during periods of higher volatility, but not during steady market increases. Overall, the results suggest that technical trading strategies calculated at high frequencies are more profitable when the market is volatile. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

First, we show that, although high frequency trading firms initiate more trades on earnings announcement days than on nonannouncement days, the proportion of volume that these trades account for is either constant or marginally lower. High frequency trading firms initiate trades representing a higher proportion of volume during RTHs than during before market or after-market hours. Second, we provide evidence that trades initiated by non-HFTs generally contribute more to price discovery than trades initiated by HFTs. For before market open earnings announcements, trades initiated by non-HFTs contribute more to price discovery than HFTs, for both NYSE- and NASDAQ-listed stocks.

Suppose trader B trades less than trader A. Other things equal, trader B is more efficient than trader A because trader B attains the same SR as trader A with less trading time. Trader B's efficiency is not apparent when annualized SR (ASR) formulas are extended to high-frequency trading (HFT). In this chapter, we show how the pantheon of modified SRs in the literature could be adjusted by a single factor, which identifies trader efficiency via adaptive HFT stock price dynamics and cycle lengths for maximal alpha. Specifically, we derive a directing process for HFT trade strategy, which jumps positively only when the trader executes a successful trade or stays flat otherwise. We identify a simple intuitively appealing summary statistic, which can be extrapolated from publicly available data, and which serves as the single factor for modifying ASR to get an efficient Sharpe ratio (ESR). Application to risk and return data for HFT in Baron et al. (2014) finds that the ESR for aggressive HFT is 1.15, medium HFT is 2.88, and passive HFT is 1.43. Those ESRs for HFT numbers are equivalent to reported SR estimates for hedge funds multistrategy, convertible option arbitrage, and fund of fund strategies. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

They are under pressure from three sets of actors-their customers (firms that trade on their exchanges), their regulator, and government-political officials-in an operating environment transformed by technology firms providing new capabilities for exchanges and their counterparties. This chapter compares and contrasts major global exchanges in terms of how these actors pressure them with respect to the trade-off between commercial viability and fairness and how the exchanges have responded to these challenges. Because the various actors have different agendas, exchanges face a dilemma. Efforts to accommodate one set of actors may generate opposition from another set. Competition among global exchanges for business encourages them to mobilize regulators and government-political officials to support their efforts to deal with HFT, but many exchanges face regulators who are attempting to control HFT. These relations define the nexus within which global exchanges must operate. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The expansion of online financial news sources, such as Internet news and social media sources, provides instantaneous access to financial news. Commercial agencies have started developing their own filtered financial news feeds, which are used by investors and traders to support their algorithmic trading strategies. In this chapter, we use a high-frequency sentiment series, developed by TRNA, to construct a series of daily sentiment scores for DJIA stock index component companies. A variety of forms of this measure, namely, basic scores, absolute values of the series, squared values of the series, and the first differences of the series, are used to estimate three standard volatility models, namely, GARCH (Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedastic), EGARCH (Exponential Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasctic), and GJR (Glosten, Jagganathan and Rundle (1993)). We use these alternative daily DJIA market sentiment scores to examine the relationship between financial news sentiment scores and the volatility of the DJIA return series.

On the whole, HFT has improved market quality by reducing bid/ask spreads, enhancing immediacy, improving price discovery, and making markets more resilient to unexpected shocks. Despite this, a relatively small suite of pathological behaviors merit attention, such as front running, spoofing, quote stuffing and smoking. Addressing these behaviors, however, must recognize that all possible market and regulatory structures have both costs and benefits. The job of the regulator, in essence, is to choose which warts to live with, in order to achieve a satisfactory trade-off of these pluses and minuses. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The risk metrics enable the HF trader to fine tune her strategies by trading off different metrics of inventory risk, which also proxy for capital risk, against expected profits. The dynamics of the midprice of the asset are driven by information flows which are impounded in the midprice by market participants who update their quotes in the limit order book. Furthermore, the midprice also exhibits stochastic jumps as a consequence of the arrival of market orders that have an impact on prices which can give rise to market momentum (expected prices to trend up or down).

Drawing on Henri Lefebvre's rhythmanalysis, we show how traders seek to calibrate their bodily rhythms to those of the market. We argue that, in the case of early-20th-century open-outcry trading pits, traders tried to enact a total merger of bodily and market rhythms. We also demonstrate how, in the 1920s and '30s, market observers began to respond to a widely perceived problem, namely that market rhythms might be contagious and that some form of separation of bodily and market rhythms might therefore be needed. Finally, we show how current high-frequency trading, despite being purely algorithmic, does not render the traders' bodies irrelevant. Yet high-frequency trading does change the role of the body rather than seeking to attune their bodies to the markets, high-frequency traders seek to calibrate their bodies to their algorithms. While the article demonstrates the usefulness of deploying Lefebvre's rhythmanalysis in analyses of financial markets, it also suggests that high-frequency trading in particular might produce new types of market rhythms that, contra Lefebvre, do not revolve around traders' bodies. © 2015, The Author(s) 2015.","Bodies; contrarian speculation; financial markets; high-frequency trading; Lefebvre; rhythmanalysis","algorithm; financial market; philosophy; trade performance; twentieth century",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84947442153

Counterarguments are presented against the arguments put forward by the opponents of HFT. Although the case for a special regulation of HFT is weak, abusive practices such as 'front running' should be banned, whether they are associated with high-frequency or low-frequency traders.

To better understand the societal implications of algorithmic trading, I construct computational agent-based models comprised of investors and algorithmic traders. I examine two overlapping types of algorithmic traders: high-frequency traders, who exploit speed advantages for profit, and market makers, who facilitate trade and supply liquidity by simultaneously maintaining offers to buy and sell. I employ simulation and empirical game-theoretic analysis to study trader behavior in equilibrium, that is, when all traders best- respond to their environment and other agents' strategies. I focus on the impact of algorithmic trading on allocative efficiency, or overall gains from trade, and the potential for a call market, in which orders are matched to trade at periodic intervals, to mitigate the latency advantages of high- frequency traders.

Although such large drawdowns incur trading costs, they do not appear to degrade the price formation process or increase the subsequent cost of trading.

Identifying and understanding the impact of algorithmic trading on financial markets has become a critical issue for market operators and regulators. Advanced data feeds and audit trail information from market operators now allow for the full observation of market participants’ actions. A key question is the extent to which it is possible to understand and characterize the behaviour of individual participants from observations of trading actions. In this paper, we consider the basic problems of categorizing and recognizing traders (or, equivalently, trading algorithms) on the basis of observed limit orders. These problems are of interest to regulators engaged in strategy identification for the purposes of fraud detection and policy development. Methods have been suggested in the literature for describing trader behaviour using classification rules defined over a feature space consisting of summary trading statistics of volume and inventory, along with derived variables that reflect the consistency of buying or selling behaviour. Our principal contribution is to suggest an entirely different feature space that is constructed by inferring key parameters of a sequential optimization model that we take as a surrogate for the decision-making process of the traders. In particular, we model trader behaviour in terms of a Markov decision process. We infer the reward (or objective) function for this process from observations of trading actions using a process from machine learning known as inverse reinforcement learning (IRL). The reward functions learned through IRL then constitute a feature space that can be the basis for supervised learning (for classification or recognition of traders) or unsupervised learning (for categorization of traders). Making use of a real-world data-set from the E-Mini futures contract, we compare two principal IRL variants, linear IRL and Gaussian Process IRL, against a method based on summary trading statistics. Results suggest that IRL-based feature spaces support accurate classification and meaningful clustering. Further, we argue that, because they attempt to learn traders’ underlying value propositions under different market conditions, the IRL methods are more informative and robust than the summary statistic-based approach and are well suited for discovering new behaviour patterns of market participants. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","Algorithmic trading; Behavioural finance; Gaussian process; High-frequency trading; Inverse reinforcement learning; Markov decision process; Support vector machine",,Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84941803646

The stock price is driven by a Markov renewal process (MRP), as described in [P. Fodra and H. Pham, Appl. Math. Finance, to appear], while market orders arrive in the limit order book via a point process correlated with the stock price itself. In this framework, we can reproduce the adverse selection risk, appearing in two different forms: the usual form due to big market orders impacting the stock price and penalizing the agent, and the weak form due to small market orders and reducing the probability of a profitable execution. We solve the market making problem by stochastic control techniques in this semi-Markov model. In the no risk-aversion case, we provide an explicit formula for the optimal controls and characterize the value function as a simple linear PDE. In the general case, we derive the optimal controls and the value function in terms of the previous result and illustrate how the risk aversion influences the trader strategy and her expected gain. Finally, by using a perturbation method, approximate optimal controls for small risk aversions are explicitly computed in terms of two simple PDEs, drastically reducing the computational cost and enlightening the financial interpretation of the results. © 2015 Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.","Adverse selection; High frequency trading; Integro-differential equation; Marked Cox process; Markov renewal process; Perturbation method",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84982255574

It is robust to non-normality and the multiple time horizon decision processes inherent in algorithmic trading.

Volume measures are the continuum analogies for discrete volume profiles commonly implemented in the execution industry. Execution then becomes an absolutely continuous measure over such a measure space, and its Radon-Nikodym derivative is commonly known as the participation of volume (PoV) function. The four impact cost components are all consistently built upon the PoV function. Some novel efforts are made for these linear impact models by having market signals more properly expressed. For the opportunistic cost, we go beyond the conventional Brownian-type motions. By working directly with the auto-covariances of the price dynamics, we remove the Markovian restriction associated with Brownians and thus allow potential memory effects. In combination, the final execution model becomes a constrained quadratic programming problem in infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. Important linear constraints such as participation capping are all permissible. Uniqueness and existence of optimal solutions are established via the theory of positive compact operators in Hilbert spaces. Several typical numerical examples explain both the behavior and versatility of the model. © The Author(s) 2014.

Instead of the continuous limit order book market design that is currently predominant, we argue that financial exchanges should use frequent batch auctions: uniform price double auctions conducted, for example, every tenth of a second. That is, time should be treated as discrete instead of continuous, and orders should be processed in a batch auction instead of serially. Our argument has three parts. First, we use millisecond-level direct-feed data from exchanges to document a series of stylized facts about how the continuous market works at high-frequency time horizons: (i) correlations completely break down; which (ii) leads to obvious mechanical arbitrage opportunities; and (iii) competition has not affected the size or frequency of the arbitrage opportunities, it has only raised the bar for how fast one has to be to capture them. Second, we introduce a simple theory model which is motivated by and helps explain the empirical facts. The key insight is that obvious mechanical arbitrage opportunities, like those observed in the data, are built into the market design-continuous-time serial-processing implies that even symmetrically observed public information creates arbitrage rents. These rents harm liquidity provision and induce a never-ending socially wasteful arms race for speed. Last, we show that frequent batch auctions directly address the flaws of the continuous limit order book. Discrete time reduces the value of tiny speed advantages, and the auction transforms competition on speed into competition on price. Consequently, frequent batch auctions eliminate the mechanical arbitrage rents, enhance liquidity for investors, and stop the high-frequency trading arms race. © The Author(s) 2015.

The high-frequency trader chooses to post either market orders or limit orders, which are represented, respectively, by impulse controls and regular controls. We discuss the consequences of the two main features of this microstructure: first, the limit orders are only partially executed, and therefore she has no control on the executed quantity. Second, the high-frequency trader faces the overtrading risk, which is the risk of large variations in her inventory. The consequences of this risk are investigated in the context of optimal liquidation. The optimal trading problem is studied by stochastic control and dynamic programming methods, and we provide the associated numerical resolution procedure and prove its convergence. We propose dimension reduction techniques in several cases of practical interest. We also detail a high-frequency trading strategy in the case where a (predictive) directional information on the price is available. Each of the resulting strategies is illustrated by numerical tests. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Inventory risk; Limit order book; Marked point process; Market making; Pro rata microstructure; Stochastic control",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84930383397

This model performs gradient descent in a constrained functional space by directly minimizing loss functions customized with different trading performance measurements. To demonstrate its practical applications, a simple trading system was designed with trading signals constructed from pdGBM predictions and fixed holding period in each trade. We tested this trading system on the high-frequency data of SPDR S&P 500 index ETF (SPY). In the out-of-sample period, it generated an average of 0.045% return per trade and an annualized Sharpe ratio close to 20 after transaction costs. Various empirical results also showed the model robustness to different parameters. These superior performances confirm the predictability of short-horizon price movements in the US equity market. We also compared the performance of this trading system with similar trading systems based on other predictive models like the gradient boosting model with L2 loss function and the penalized linear model. Results showed that pdGBM substantially outperformed all other models by higher returns in each month of the testing period. Additionally, pdGBM has many advantages including its capability of automatic predictor selection and nonlinear pattern recognition, as well as its simply structured and interpretable output function. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","Gradient boosting; High-frequency; Systematic trading; TAQ; Trading performance",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84936858019

In the previous study, we built an artificial market model and investigated for the impact of non-position-based market maker’s spread to the markets’ shares of trading volumes. However it had the serious problem that the non-position-based market maker is too simple to manage its own position properly and so we could not judge weather the result of previous study is correct or not. Thus in this study, we made a position-based market maker and explored the competition, in terms of taking markets’ shares of trading volumes, between two artificial financial markets that have exactly the same specifications except existing a market maker, the non-position-based market maker or the position-based market maker. As a result, we found that the position-based market maker can acquire the share of trading volumes from the competitor even though its spread is bigger than bid-offer-spread of the competitor. Moreover, we revealed that position-based market maker can get a profit even in the situation that its spread or tick sizes of the stock exchanges are small. In addition to that, position-based market maker made a profit in almost all experiments which we conducted in this research by changing its spread and tick sizes of markets. At last, we confirmed that position-based market maker can manage its position properly compared to non-position-based market maker. In conclusion, the position-based market maker can not only supply liquidity to stock exchanges and contribute to acquire the share from the competitor as well as the non-position-based market maker does, but also manage its own position properly and make a profit. © 2015, Japanese Society for Artificial Intelligence.

For a benchmark model of pure liquidity competition, we give a closed-form solution for optimal display sizes. We show that competition in liquidity supply incentivizes the use of hidden orders to prevent losses due to over-bidding. Thus, because aggressive liquidity competition is more prevalent in liquid stocks, our model predicts that the proportion of hidden liquidity is higher in liquid markets. Our theoretical considerations ares supported by an empirical analysis using high-frequency order-message data from NASDAQ.

The academic roots of this industry-changing deployment of AI technologies can be traced back to research published by a team of researchers at IBM at IJCAI 2001, which was subsequently replicated and extended by De Luca and Cliff at IJCAI 2011 and ICAART 2011. Here, we focus on the order management policy enforced by Open Exchange (OpEx), the open source algorithmic trading system designed by De Luca, for both human and robot traders: while humans are allowed to manage multiple orders simultaneously, robots only deal with one order at the time. We hypothesise that such unbalance may have strongly influenced the victory of human traders over robot traders, reported in past studies by De Luca et al., and by Cartlidge and Cliff. We employed OpEx to implement a multiple-order policy for robots as well as humans, and ran several human vs. robot trading experiments. Using aggregated market metrics and time analysis, we reached two important conclusions. First, we demonstrated that, in mixed human-robot markets, robots dealing multiple simultaneous orders consistently outperform robots dealing one order at a time. And second, we showed that while human traders outperform single-order robot traders under specific circumstances, multiple-order robot traders are never outperformed by human traders. We thus conclude that the performance of robot traders in a human-robot mixed market is strongly influenced by the order management policy they employ.

Consequently, TCP/IP offload is becoming increasingly popular with standard network interface cards. TCP/IP Offload Engines have also emerged for FPGAs, and are being offered by vendors such as Intilop, Fraunhofer HHI, PLDA and Dini Group. With the target application being high-frequency trading, these implementations focus on low latency and support a limited session count. However, many more applications beyond high-frequency trading can potentially be accelerated inside an FPGA once TCP with high session count is available inside the fabric. This way, a network-attached FPGA on ingress and egress to a CPU can accelerate functions such as encryption, compression, memcached and many others in addition to running the complete network stack. This paper introduces a novel architecture for a 10Gbps line-rate TCP/IP stack for FPGAs that can scale with the number of sessions and thereby addresses these new applications. We prototyped the design on a VC709 development board, demonstrating compatibility with existing network infrastructure, operating at full 10Gbps throughput full-duplex while supporting 10,000 sessions. Finally, the design has been described primarily using high-level synthesis, which accelerates development time and improves maintainability. © 2015 IEEE.","10G network stack; High session count; High-level Synthesis (HLS); Reconfigurable Hardware; TCP/IP","Commerce; Computer hardware; Computers; Electronic trading; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Hardware; High level synthesis; Integrated circuit design; Interfaces (computer); Internet protocols; Reconfigurable architectures; Reconfigurable hardware; Synthesis (chemical); Transmission control protocol; High session count; High-frequency trading; Network infrastructure; Network interface cards; Network stack; Target application; TCP/IP; Tcp/ip offload engines; Network architecture",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84943381569

First, the parameters of the corresponding Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process are estimated by auto-regressive Hidden Markov Models (AR-HMM) in order to capture the underlying characteristics of the financial time series. Portfolio optimization is then performed according to maximizing the mean return by the means of the introduced ARHMM prediction algorithm. The optimization itself is carried out by stochastic search algorithms. The presented solutions satisfy the cardinality constraint thus providing a sparse portfolios which minimizes the transaction costs and maximizes the interpretability of the results. The performance has been tested on historical data obtained from S&P 500 and FOREX. The results demonstrate that a good average return can be achieved by the proposed ARHMM based trading algorithms in realistic scenarios. Furthermore, profitability can also be accomplished in the presence of secondary effects.","Algorithmic trading; Financial time series; Markov models; Mean reversion; Parameter estimation","Algorithms; Commerce; Financial data processing; Hidden Markov models; Markov processes; Stochastic systems; Time series; Electronic trading; Optimization; Algorithmic trading; Cardinality constraints; Financial time series; Markov model; Mean reversion; Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process; Portfolio optimization; Stochastic search algorithms; Parameter estimation",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928988065

Spreads do not change, however. Stocks from a pan-European control sample show no such liquidity changes. Thus, the Italian OTR fee had the effect of making Italian stocks markets more shallow and less resilient. Large stocks are more severely affected than midcaps. We also find evidence of a limited decrease in turnover.

The focus of this work is to increase trading efficiency by improving the accuracy of intraday volume forecasts, which are used in algorithmic trading. An intraday volume forecast predicts the distribution of trading volume throughout the day, and allows traders to make better decisions regarding the timing and quantity of their trades. An accurate intraday volume forecast is an important input to trading decisions and will ultimately improve traders' ability to meet benchmarks, such as volume weighted average price. This work seeks to understand the performance of three classes of models: moving average, exponentially weighted moving average, and average exponentially weighted moving average, for intra-day volume prediction over a large sample of U.S. equities. For each model, we explore a broad range of parameterizations and seek to understand how various factors affect model performance. Models are evaluated based on a variety of different metrics, such as mean square error and maximum absolute deviation. We report on the best performing models for a variety of stocks and scenarios. Overall, the average exponentially weighted moving average model performed the best across the examined parameters. © 2015 IEEE.","Algorithmic Trading; Exponentially Weighted Moving Average; Moving Average; Volume Profile","Algorithms; Finance; Financial data processing; Financial markets; Forecasting; Mean square error; Algorithmic trading; Exponentially weighted moving average; Maximum absolute deviations; Moving averages; Trading efficiency; Volume distributions; Volume Profile; Volume-weighted averages; Commerce",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84937597610

The complexity of a multi-market environment poses a bi-level nonlinear optimization problem. The lower-level problem admits a unique solution thus enabling the second order conditions to be satisfied under a set of reasonable assumptions. The model is computationally affordable and solvable using standard software packages. The simulation results presented in the paper show the model’s effectiveness using real trade data. From the outset, great effort was made to ensure that this was a challenging practical problem which also had a direct real world application.

All of these investors are trying to search an infinite number of trading rules to find a useful one, which is the most important factor in algorithmic trading. However, finding a useful trading rule requires a huge amount of search time. A trading rule is represented by a market's index parameters, the possible combinations of which are infinite. Our study goal is to support investors in reducing trading rule search time. For trading rule search, a trading rule with certain parameters is evaluated by simulation. Investors choose a market's index parameters by intuition and experience to reduce the search time. However, their intuition and experience are unstable, and the process of using them is not clear. We define this process of finding a useful rule as trading rule search and design the process as a novel distributed system. Investors who employ our system can search more trading rules in a shorter time than with existing systems. In this paper, we used portable batch system (PBS) in the job management system (JMS) of a distributed system.

The platform enables participants to use different trading policies in order to automate and improve the efficiency of resource trading.

This paper provides new insights into improving the time-varying risk-adjusted performance of trading systems controlled by Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Systems (ANFIS) or Dynamic Evolving Neuro Fuzzy Systems (DENFIS). Contrary to most former studies which focus on daily predictions, we compare these models in an intraday stock trading scenario using high-frequency data. Firstly, we propose a dynamic extension of the popular moving average rule and enhance it with a model validation methodology using heat maps to analyse favourable profitability in specific holding time and signal regions. Secondly, we study the effect of realistic constraints such as transaction costs and intraday trading hours, which many existing approaches in the literature ignore. Thirdly, unlike most former studies that only aim to minimise statistical error measures, we compare this approach with financially more relevant risk-adjusted objective functions. To this end, we also consider an innovative ANFIS ensemble architecture which on an intraday level dynamically selects between different risk-adjusted models. Our study shows that accounting for transaction costs and the use of risk-return objective functions provide better results in out-of-sample tests. Overall, the ANN model is identified as a viable model, however ANFIS shows more stable time-varying performance across multiple market regimes. Moreover, we find that combining multiple risk-adjusted objective functions using an ANFIS ensemble yields promising results. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","ANFIS; ANFIS ensemble; ANN; DENFIS; Dynamic moving average; High-frequency trading","Commerce; Neural networks; ANFIS; ANFIS ensemble; ANN; DENFIS; High-frequency trading; Moving averages; Fuzzy systems; adaptive neuro fuzzy system; algorithm; analytical error; article; artificial neural network; commercial phenomena; computer prediction; controlled study; dynamic evolving fuzzy system; fuzzy system; intermethod comparison; mathematical analysis; mathematical computing; mathematical model; priority journal; profit; risk assessment; stock market; trading; validation process",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84901603197

This paper proposes an expert system that uses novel machine learning techniques to predict the price return over these seasonal events, and then uses these predictions to develop a profitable trading strategy. While simple approaches to trading these regularities can prove profitable, such trading leads to potential large drawdowns (peak-to-trough decline of an investment measured as a percentage between the peak and the trough) in profit. In this paper, we introduce an automated trading system based on performance weighted ensembles of random forests that improves the profitability and stability of trading seasonality events. An analysis of various regression techniques is performed as well as an exploration of the merits of various techniques for expert weighting. The performance of the models is analysed using a large sample of stocks from the DAX. The results show that recency-weighted ensembles of random forests produce superior results in terms of both profitability and prediction accuracy compared with other ensemble techniques. It is also found that using seasonality effects produces superior results than not having them modelled explicitly. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

It is very common in practice that the same problems emerge in different application domains (e.g. the modeling support for complex event processing is desirable in the domain of algorithmic trading, IT security assessment, robust monitoring, etc.). A DSL operates in one single domain, but the above-mentioned cross-domain challenges raise the question: is it possible to automate the design of DSLs which are so closely related? This approach demonstrates how a family of domain-specific languages can be developed for multiple domains from a single generic language metamodel with generative techniques. The basic idea is to refine the targeted domain with separating the problem domain from the context domain. This allows designing a generic language based on the problem and customizing it with the appropriate extensions for arbitrary contexts, thus defining as many DSLs and as many contexts as one extends the generic language for. The authors also present an ontology-based approach for establishing contextspecific domain knowledge bases. The results are discussed through a case study, where a language for event processing is designed and extended for multiple context domains. © 2014 by IGI Global.

The text proposes a framework according to which finance can best be understood as a complex technical system tightly coupled to other social, economic systems. To be more precise, the paper attempts to show how finance is not just any complex system but it can be understood as an ecology of evolving socio-technical systems, sub-systems such as investment banks, hedge funds, high-frequency trading traders, retail investors, pensions funds, etc. All of these are the technical building blocks of our financial markets. Moreover, we attempt to show how concepts from other disciplines, such as entropy, information and noise, can be useful in opening up the world of finance from its traditional economic milieu. Although the following text is confined to the discursive realm of humanities/social sciences, it echoes the analytical approaches of econophysics and experimental economics and particularly the ongoing research around ‘computational evolutionary economics’ [Mirowski, P. 2007. “Markets Come to Bits: Evolution, Computation and Markomata in Economic Science.” Journal of Economic Behavior & Organization 63: 209–242; Mirowski, P. 2010. “Inherent Vice: Minsky, Markomata, and the Tendency of Markets to Undermine Themselves.” Journal of Institutional Economics 6: 415–443]. This becomes particularly relevant in the context of the so-called robot phase transition from human-dominated trading to the more automatic electronic trading. The current microstructure of automatic market-making can be understood as an ‘ecological niche’ developed by ultra-fast trading algorithms which ‘feed’ on the asymmetries and disparities of the wider ‘financial ecology’. They do this by dissipating noise and adding to the complexity of market microstructure a behaviour that can push the whole ecology to critical thresholds, sometimes referred to as flash crashes. This whole process can ultimately be described by Philip Mirowski's notion of ‘inherent vice’, as well as by Sir Robert May's concept of instability ‘which develops in ecosystems upon increasing bio-diversity’ [Caccioli, F., M. Marsili, and P. Vivo. 2007. “Eroding Market Stability by Proliferation of Financial Instruments.” The European Physical Journal B–Condensed Matter and Complex Systems 71: 467–479; Haldane, A., and R.

Initially, we introduce several demands for acceleration with FPGA to achieve low latency calculation and control. As an application example, we show a High Frequency Trading. We accelerate it by FPGA NIC with C-based and SQL-based HLS, and show the necessity of high level language customizable reconfigurable chip. Then, we illustrate the difference of FPGA and processor (CPU, GPGPU) with the 'FSM+Datapath' model and examine how the architecture difference affects delay and parallelism of operations. Next, we discuss parallelization of operations, threads with High Level Synthesis for FPGA and software compiler for processors. The main advantage of the former method is it is able to parallelize operations beyond control dependencies while the latter method has to obey control dependencies. Finally, some experimental results prove that 'FPGA and HLS' generate better performance than a processor for control intensive algorithm. © 2014 IEEE.",,"Application examples; Better performance; Complex algorithms; Customizable; High Level Synthesis; High-frequency trading; Parallelizations; Reconfigurable chips; Algorithms; Computer aided design; Computer architecture; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Multiprocessing systems; Program compilers; Reconfigurable hardware",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84897895104

The technique is based on the feature-weighted Euclidean distance to the centroid of a training cluster. A set of micro technical indicators, traditionally employed by professional scalpers, is used in this setting. We describe procedures for removal of outliers, normalization of feature points, computation of weights of features, and classification of test points. The complexity of computation at each quote received is proportional to the number of features. In addition, processing of indicators is parallelizable and, therefore, suitable in high-frequency domains. Experiments are presented for different prediction time intervals and confidence thresholds. Predictions made 10 to 2000 milliseconds before a price change resulted in an accuracy that ranged monotonically from 97% to 75%. Finally, we observed an empirical relation between Euclidean distance in the feature space and prediction accuracy. © The Authors.

Advanced data feed and audit trail information from market operators now make the full observation of market participants' actions possible. A key question is the extent to which it is possible to understand and characterize the behavior of individual participants from observations of trading actions. In this paper, we consider the basic problems of categorizing and recognizing traders (or, equivalently, trading algorithms) on the basis observed limit orders. Our approach, which is based on inverse reinforcement learning (IRL), is to model trading decisions as a Markov decision process and then use observations of an optimal decision policy to find the reward function. The approach strikes a balance between two desirable features in that it captures key empirical properties of order book dynamics and yet remains computationally tractable. Making use of a real-world data set from the E-Mini futures contract, we compare two principal IRL variants, linear IRL and Gaussian process IRL. Results suggest that IRL-based feature spaces support accurate classification and meaningful clustering. © 2014 IEEE.","Algorithmic Trading; Behavioral Finance; Gaussian Process; High Frequency Trading; Inverse Reinforcement Learning; Markov Decision Process; Support Vector Machine","Algorithms; Correlation theory; Electronic data interchange; Financial markets; Gaussian distribution; Gaussian noise (electronic); Markov processes; Reinforcement learning; Support vector machines; Virtual reality; Algorithmic trading; Behavioral finance; Gaussian Processes; High-frequency trading; Inverse reinforcement learning; Markov Decision Processes; Commerce",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84908472703

The questions rise if high frequency trading (HFT) provides more efficient, liquid markets and is economically beneficial. In this paper an algorithm based on statistical arbitrage is tested. Statistical arbitrage is a well-known trading strategy where profit arises from pricing inefficiencies between correlated financial instruments. An algorithm of statistical arbitrage tries to find a pair of correlated instruments that move together and take long/short positions when they diverge abnormally, hoping that the prices will converge in the near future. Recent computational expansion in financial modeling and the ever increasing demand for order execution speed is moving market making and price discovery strategies into high frequency trading (HFT) or the milliseconds realm, where HFT already generates nearly 2/3 of the overall trading volume. In this report we apply high frequency data from NYMEX exchange to test a trading system based on statistical arbitrage in one of the most liquid futures market, i.e. natural gas futures. The overall results suggest that statistical arbitrage in HFT environment significantly outperforms traditional trading strategies, provides liquidity to the markets and denies the efficient market hypothesis. © Vilnius University, 2002-2014 © Brno University of Technology, 2002-2014 © University of Latvia, 2002-2014.","Algorithmic trading; Efficient market hypothesis; Futures market; High frequency trading; Pairs trading; Statistical arbitrage",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84923377438

It is therefore desirable to sacrifice some degree of accuracy for transparency.

In this paper, we explore the possibility of evolving transparent entry- and exit trading strategies for the E-mini S&P 500 index futures market in a high-frequency trading environment using grammatical evolution. We compare the performance of models incorporating risk into their calculations with models that do not.

A Lorentzian approximation to R-matrix theory is used to analyze the complex structures observed in the Dow Jones Industrial Average on a typical trading day. Resonant structures in excited nuclei are characterized by the values of their fundamental strength function, (average total width of the states)/(average spacing between adjacent states). Here, values of the ratios (average lifetime of individual states of a given component of the daily Dow Jones Industrial Average)/(average interval between the adjacent states) are determined. The ratios for the observed fine and intermediate structure of the index are found to be essentially constant throughout the trading day. These quantitative findings are characteristic of the highly statistical nature of many-body, strongly interacting systems, typified by daily trading. It is therefore proposed that the values of these ratios, determined in the first hour-or-so of trading, be used to provide valuable information concerning the likely performance of the fine and intermediate components of the index for the remainder of the trading day. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Commerce; Electronic trading; Financial markets; Integrated circuits; Matrix algebra; Nuclear reactions; Reaction intermediates; Dow Jones Industrial averages; High-frequency trading; Information concerning; Interacting system; Intermediate components; Intermediate structures; Mathematical theory; Resonant structures; Industrial economics",Conference Paper,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84896937626

FPGA cards are widely used to reduce latency and accelerate market data processing. To create a low latency trading system, it is crucial to effectively build a representation of the market state (book) in hardware. Thus, we have designed a new hardware architecture, which updates the book with the best bid/offer prices based on the incoming messages from the exchange. For each message a corresponding financial instrument needs to be looked up and its record needs to be updated. Proposed architecture is utilizing cuckoo hashing for the book handling, which enables low latency symbol lookup and high memory utilization. In this paper we discuss a trade-off between lookup latency and memory utilization. With average latency of 253 ns the proposed architecture is able to handle 119 275 instruments while using only 144 Mbit QDR SRAM. © 2014 IEEE.",,"Algorithms; Data handling; Economic and social effects; Electronic trading; Hardware; Static random access storage; Algorithmic trading; Hardware architecture; High-frequency trading; Lookup latency; Market data processing; Memory utilization; Proposed architectures; Trading systems; Memory architecture",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84938792487

However, the MM strategies without any forecasting power are not safe while trading. In this paper, we design and implement a twotier framework, which includes a trading signal generator based on a supervised learning approach and an event-driven MM strategy. The proposed generator incorporates the information within order book microstructure and market news to provide directional predictions. The MM strategy in the second tier trades on the signals and prevents itself from profit loss led by market trending. Using half a year price tick data from Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) and Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE), and corresponding Thomson Reuters news of the same time period, we conduct the back-testing and simulation on an industrial near-to-reality simulator. From the empirical results, we find that 1) strategies with signals perform better than strategies without any signal in terms of average daily profit and loss (PnL) and sharpe ratio (SR), and 2) correct predictions do help MM strategies readjust their quoting along with market trending, which avoids the strategies triggering stop loss procedure that further realizes the paper loss. © 2014 Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","algorithmic trading; market making strategy; market simulation; news impact analysis; order book microstructure","Electronic trading; Financial markets; Forecasting; Microstructure; Profitability; Algorithmic trading; Design and implements; Directional predictions; Impact analysis; Market simulation; Order book; Shanghai stock exchanges; Supervised learning approaches; Commerce",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84905105714

Our method allows for autonomous bidding for electricity units to create an emerging market price for electricity. We start with replicating the popular Zero-Intelligence-Plus algorithm and setting it in a electricity supplier-consumer scenario. We identify significant weaknesses of applying this in an electricity market especially when intermittent sources of energy are present or when the supplier to consumer ratio is very small. A new algorithm (ZIP-260) is proposed which includes a measure of fairness based on minimising the deviation across all un-matched demand for a given period. This approach means that no consumer in the system is constantly experiencing an electricity supply deficit. We show and explain how market conditions can lead to collective bargaining of consumers and monopolistic behaviour of suppliers and conclude with observations on automated trading for smart grids. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2014.",,"Algorithms; Cybernetics; Electric utilities; Industrial relations; Smart power grids; Automated trading; Economic principle; Electricity market; Electricity supply; Emerging markets; Market condition; Sources of energy; Zero intelligence plus; Commerce",Conference Paper,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84958538453

Information systems have often been applied to support investors by forecasting price changes in securities markets. In addition to the asset price, liquidity represents another financial variable that has a high relevance for investors because it constitutes a main determinant of total transaction costs. Previous research has shown that the level of liquidity is affected by the publication of corporate disclosures. To derive an optimal order execution strategy that minimises the transaction costs, investors as well as automated trading engines must be able to anticipate changes in the available market liquidity. However, there is no research on how to forecast the impact of corporate disclosures on market liquidity. Therefore, we propose an IT artefact that allows automated trading engines to appropriately react to news-related liquidity shocks. The system indicates whether the publication of a regulatory corporate disclosure will be followed by a positive liquidity shock, i.e.; lower transaction costs compared to historical levels. Utilising text mining techniques, the content of the corporate disclosures is analysed to generate a trading signal. Furthermore, the trading signal is evaluated within a simulation-based use case that considers English and German corporate disclosures and is shown to be of economic value. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Automated trading; e-Finance; Forecasting; Liquidity; Simulation; Text mining","Automation; Costs; Data mining; Engines; Forecasting; Investments; Signal processing; Automated trading; E finances; Liquidity; Simulation; Text mining; Commerce",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84900526411

Then we proposed an extended model of the Bayesian execution strategy.

Our results suggest that: (i) momentum market is the most suitable model for testing AT strategies, since it quickly fills the Limit Order book and produces results comparable to those of a liquid stock; (ii) the priors estimation method proposed in this paper − within the Bayesian adaptive agent model − can be advantageous in relatively stable markets, when trading patterns in consecutive days are strongly correlated, and (iii) there exists a trade-off between the frequency of decision making and more complex decision criteria, on one side, and the negative outcome of lost trading on the agents’ side due to them not participating actively in the market for some of the execution steps. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014.","Algorithmic trading; Backtesting; Bayesian adaptive agents; Simulation","Computational methods; Correlation theory; Decision making; Economic and social effects; Frequency estimation; Statistical tests; Adaptive agents; Agent-based model; Algorithmic trading; Backtesting; Estimation methods; Execution strategies; Market simulation; Simulation; Algorithms",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84921649404

However, many factors contribute to the complexity of developing such integrated decision-making systems. Some of these factors include: the inherent diversity of financial assets, the heterogeneity of trading and risk assessment strategies, and the highly dynamic nature of financial markets. Moreover, the large volume of data to be analyzed severely affects the system's ability to make timely decisions, especially, for high-frequency trading.

In this paper, analysis of the efficacy of applying an artificial neural network to the time series data produced by fluctuating stock prices is discussed in more detail. There are few current models that are capable of analyzing stocks but they lack in predicting effectively. Results of this neural network are examined through the generated return on investment. The network used for stock analysis is a four layer, feed-forward artificial neural network. The results of this network reveal that artificial neural networks are capable of performing technical analysis on stock prices.

We find that AT causes an improvement in two measures of price efficiency: the frequency of triangular arbitrage opportunities and the autocorrelation of high-frequency returns. We show that the reduction in arbitrage opportunities is associated primarily with computers taking liquidity. This result is consistent with the view that AT improves informational efficiency by speeding up price discovery, but that it may also impose higher adverse selection costs on slower traders. In contrast, the reduction in the autocorrelation of returns owes more to the algorithmic provision of liquidity. We also find evidence consistent with the strategies of algorithmic traders being highly correlated.

Trading has been explored by economists to be an important mechanism for maintaining development. In an imperialistic country, trading makes imperialists capture resources from colonies, meanwhile providing technologies or cultures for colonies to develop themselves. Inspired by this economic phenomenon, this paper transplants the trading mechanism to imperialist competitive algorithm (ICA) and proposes an improved ICA with import and export mechanisms (IICA). IICA is designed to alleviate the problem of slow convergence without significantly impairing the parallel competitive feature of ICA. It is characterized by allowing the imperialist to capture useful aspects of colonies to enhance itself, and meanwhile making colonies learn advanced components from their imperialist. In this way, the trading mechanism enables imperialists and colonies to strengthen interactions during them. The performance of IICA is validated on 23 benchmark functions. Its high performance is confirmed by comparing with other ICA variants. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014.",,"Intelligent computing; International trade; Optimization; Benchmark functions; Imperialist competitive algorithm (ICA); Imperialist competitive algorithms; Import and exports; Slow convergences; Trading mechanism; Benchmarking",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84908569032

This is done through their liquidity demanding orders. In contrast, HFTs' liquidity supplying orders are adversely selected. The direction of HFTs' trading predicts price changes over short horizons measured in seconds.

We use this approach for real one-minute high frequency data of the most traded currency pairs worldwide: EUR/USD, USD/JPY, GBP/USD, AUD/USD, USD/CHF, and USD/CAD. The STGP performance is compared with that of parametric and non-parametric models and validated by two formal empirical tests. We perform in-sample and out-of-sample comparisons between all models on the basis of forecast performance and investment return. Furthermore, our paper shows the relative strength of these models with respect to the actual trading profit generated by their forecasts. Empirical experiments suggest that the STGP forecasting technique significantly outperforms the traditional econometric models.

The second system uses genetic programming to derive trading strategies. As input data in our experiments, we used technical indicators of NASDAQ stocks. As output, the algorithms generate trading strategies, i.e. buy, hold, and sell signals. Our hypothesis that strategies obtained by genetic programming bring better results than buy-and-hold strategy has been proven as statistically significant.

According to the microstructure noise effect, volatility is a decreasing function of the time-scale used to estimate it. The Epps effect states that cross correlations between asset returns are increasing functions of the time-scale at which the returns are estimated. The microstructure noise is explained as the result of the negative return correlations inherent in the definition of the bid-ask bounce component (ii).

Whether VPIN is more strongly correlated with volume or volatility depends on the exact implementation. Hence, it is crucial for the interpretation of VPIN as a harbinger of market turbulence or as a predictor of short-term volatility to control for current volume and volatility. Doing so, we find no evidence of incremental predictive power of VPIN for future volatility. Likewise, VPIN does not attain unusual extremes prior to the flash crash. Moreover, the properties of VPIN are strongly dependent on the underlying trade classification. In particular, using more standard classification techniques, VPIN behaves in the exact opposite manner of what is portrayed in ELO (2011a, 2012a). At a minimum, ELO should rationalize this systematic reversal as the classification becomes more closely aligned with individual transactions.ELO (2014) dispute our findings. This note reviews the econometric methodology and the market microstructure arguments behind our conclusions and responds to a number of inaccurate assertions. In addition, we summarize fresh empirical evidence that corroborates the hypothesis that VPIN is largely driven, and significantly distorted, by the volume and volatility innovations. Furthermore, we note there is compelling new evidence that transaction-based classification schemes are more accurate than the bulk volume strategies advocated by ELO for constructing VPIN. In fact, using perfect classification leads to diametrically opposite results relative to ELO (2011a, 2012a). © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Flash crash; High-frequency trading; Order flow toxicity; Order imbalance; PIN; VIX; Volatility forecasting; VPIN",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84891828976

We provide a model-free option pricing approach with neural networks, which can be applied to real-time pricing and hedging of FX options. In contrast to well-known theoretical models, an essential advantage of our approach is the simultaneous pricing across different strike prices and parsimonious use of real-time input variables. To test its ability for the purpose of high-frequency trading, we perform an empirical run-time trading simulation with a tick dataset of EUR/USD options on currency futures of 4 weeks. In very short non-overlapping 15-minute out-of-sample intervals, theoretical option prices derived from the Black model compete against nonparametric option prices through two different neural network topologies. We show that the approximated pricing function of learning networks is suitable for generating fast run-time option pricing evaluation as their performance is slightly better in comparison to theoretical prices. The derivation of the network function is also useful for performing hedging strategies. We conclude that the performance of closed-form pricing models depends highly on the volatility estimator, whereas neural networks can avoid this estimation problem but require market liquidity for training. Nevertheless, we also have to take particular enhancements into account, which give us useful hints for further research and steps.

Analysts are trying to outperform a passive investment in an index such as the S&P 500 Index. However, statistics have shown that most analysts fail to consistently beat the index. A number of Neural Network based methods for detecting trading opportunities on Futures contracts on the S&P 500 Index have been published in the literature. However, such methods have generally been unable to demonstrate sustained performance over a significant period of time. The authors of this paper show, through the application of over ten years of experience in quantitative modelling and trading, a different type of Neural Network approach to beating the S&P 500 Index. Rather than trading Futures contracts, it is shown that by using Neural Networks to intelligently select just a handful of stocks a performance significantly in excess of a buy and hold position on the S&P 500 Index could have been achieved over a seven year period. The effect of transaction costs is also considered. © 2014 IEEE.","Advanced Computational Intelligence for Algorithmic Trading; Applications of Neural Networks for Financial Modelling and Forecasting","Artificial intelligence; Economics; Algorithmic trading; Futures contract; Modelling and forecasting; Sustained performance; Transaction cost; Commerce",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84908480207

The theoretical justification for our solution is based on multivariate statistical analysis of multidimensional investment tasks, particularly on relations between data size, algorithm complexity and portfolio efficacy. To reduce the dimensionality/sample size problem, a larger task is broken down into smaller parts by means of item similarity - clustering. Similar problems are given to smaller groups to solve. Groups, however, vary in many aspects. Pseudo randomly-formed groups compose a large number of modules of feed-forward decision-making systems. The evolution mechanism forms collections of the best modules for each single short time period. Final solutions are carried forward to the global scale where a collection of the best modules is chosen using a multiclass cost-sensitive perceptron. Collected modules are combined in a final solution in an equally weighted approach (1/N Portfolio). The efficacy of the novel decision-making approach was demonstrated through a financial portfolio optimization problem, which yielded adequate amounts of real world data. For portfolio construction, we used 11,730 simulated trading robot performances. The dataset covered the period from 2003 to 2012 when environmental changes were frequent and largely unpredictable. Walk-forward and out-of-sample experiments show that an approach based on sustainable economy principles outperforms benchmark methods and that shorter agent training history demonstrates better results in periods of a changing environment. © 2014 Vilnius Gediminas Technical University (VGTU) Press.","Algorithmic trading; Automated trading; Clustering; Markowitz; Mean-variance; Optimization; Portfolio; Portfolio optimization; Regularization; Simulation",,Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84901799365

Speed is an important aspect in financial problems, especially in the field of algorithmic trading, where a delay in taking a decision could cost millions. To offset this performance loss, EDDIE has been modified to take advantage of multi-core CPUs and dedicated GPUs. This has been achieved by modifying the candidate solution evaluation to use an OpenCL kernel, allowing the parallel evaluation of solutions. Our computational results have shown improvements in the running time of EDDIE when the evaluation was delegated to the OpenCL kernel running on a multi-core CPU, with speed ups up to 21 times faster than the original EDDIE algorithm. While most previous works in the literature reported significantly improvements in performance when running an OpenCL kernel on a GPU device, we did not observe this in our results. Further investigation revealed that memory copying overheads and branching code in the kernel are potentially causes of the (under-)performance of the OpenCL kernel when running on the GPU device.","Financial forecasting; Genetic programming; GPU; OpenCL","Algorithms; Finance; Genetic algorithms; Program processors; Algorithmic trading; Computational results; Financial forecasting; Financial problems; GPU; OpenCL; Parallel evaluation; Performance loss; Genetic programming",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84905653327

Whilst many common approaches only consider the bid-ask spread when measuring market impact, the authors aim to analyse the detailed limit order book data, which has more informational content. Design/methodology/approach: Using data from the London Stock Exchange's electronic SETS platform, the authors transform limit order book compositions into volume-weighted average price curves and accordingly estimate market impact. The regression coefficients of these curves are estimated, and their intraday patterns are revealed using a nonparametric kernel regression model. Findings: The authors find that market impact is nonlinear, time-varying, and asymmetric. Inferences drawn from marginal probabilities regarding Granger-causality do not show a significant impact of slope coefficients on the opposite side of the limit order book, thus implying that each side of the market is simultaneously rather than sequentially influenced by prevailing market conditions. Research limitations/implications: Results show that intraday seasonality patterns of liquidity may be exploited through trade scheduling algorithms in an attempt to minimise the trading costs associated with large institutional trades. Originality/value: The use of the detailed limit order book to reveal intraday patterns in liquidity provision offers better insight into the interactions of market participants.

When an analysis of RRL trading performance is conducted using low frequency financial data (e.g. daily data), the weakening autocorrelation in price changes may lead to a decrease in trading profits as compared to its applications in high frequency trading. There therefore is a need to improve RRL for the purposes of daily equity trading. This paper presents two parameter update schemes (the 'average elitist' and the 'multiple elitist') for RRL. The purpose of the first scheme is to improve out-of-sample performance of RRL-type trading systems. The second scheme aims to exploit serial dependence in stock returns to improve trading performance, when traders deal with highly correlated stocks. Profitability and stability of the trading system are examined by using four groups of S&P stocks for the period January 2009 to December 2012. It is found that the Sharpe ratios of the stocks increase after we use the two parameter update schemes in the RRL trading system. © 2014 IEEE.",,"Artificial intelligence; Investments; Learning algorithms; Profitability; Reinforcement learning; Financial data; Financial trading; High-frequency trading; Highly-correlated; ITS applications; Recurrent reinforcement learning; Serial dependence; Trading systems; Commerce",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84908594427

However, the realworld time series, such as those fromnancial markets, are typically taken at irregular time intervals. It is a common practice to resample or bin the irregular time series into a regular one, but there are significant limitations on this practice. For example, if one is to resample the trading activities of a stock into hourly series, then the time series can only last through the trading day, because there usually is no trading in the night. In this work, we explore the dynamics of irregular time series through a high-performance computing algorithm known as Non-Uniform Fast Fourier Transform (NUFFT).To illustrate its effectiveness, we apply NUFFT on the trading records of natural gas futures contracts for the last seven years. Tests show that NUFFT results accurately capture well-known structural features in the trading records, such as weekly and daily cycles. At the same time the results also reveal unexplored features, such as the presence of multiple power laws. In particular, we observe an emerging power law in the Fourier spectra in recent years. We also detect a strong Fourier component at the precise frequency once per minute, which implies significant automated trading activities might be triggered by clock. © 2014 IEEE.",,"Commerce; Digital storage; Electronic trading; Fast Fourier transforms; Fourier series; Time series; Automated trading; Fourier components; High performance computing; Irregular time series; Natural gas futures; Non-uniform fast Fourier transforms; Real-world time series; Structural feature; Time series analysis",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84988221405

They are characterized by a stream of very short requests, and thus they require a very high I/O throughput. The traditional solution for supporting such applications is to use an array of hard disks. With the advent of solid state drives (SSDs), storage vendors are increasingly preferring them because their I/O throughput can scale up to a million IOPS (I/O operations per second). In this paper, we design a family of algorithms, RADIR, to schedule requests for such systems. Our algorithms are lock-free/wait-free, lineariz-able, and take the characteristics of requests into account such as the deadlines, request sizes, dependences, and the amount of available redundancy in RAID configurations. We perform simulations with workloads derived from traces provided by Microsoft and demonstrate a scheduling throughput of 900K IOPS on a 64 thread Intel server. Our algorithms are 2-3 orders of magnitude faster than the versions that use locks. We show detailed results for the effect of deadlines, request sizes, and the effect of RAID levels on the quality of the schedule. © 2014 IEEE.","Flash bandwidth; I/O scheduling; lock-free; resource allocation model; wait-free","Bandwidth; Locks (fasteners); Scheduling; Throughput; Windows operating system; Algorithmic trading; Lock-free; Novel applications; Orders of magnitude; Resource allocation model; Solid state drives; Storage systems; Wait free; Algorithms",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84988214390

Currently, the tools of the news analytics have been increasingly used by traders in the U.S. and Europe. The interest in news analytics is related to the ability to predict changes of prices, volatility and trading volume on the stock market. The emphasis of the paper is on assessing the added value of using news analytics data in improving the explanatory power of the GARCH-Jump model. Based on empirical evidences for some of FTSE100 companies, the paper examines two GARCH models with jumps. First we consider the well-known GARCH model with autoregressive conditional jump intensity proposed in [1]. Then we introduce the GARCH-Jumps model augmented with news intensity and obtain some empirical results. The main assumption of the model is that jump intensity might change over time and that jump intensity depends linearly on the number of news (the news intensity). The comparison of the values of log likelihood supports the hypothesis of impact of news on the jump intensity of volatility.","GARCH models; News analytics; Stock volatility modelling","Auto-regressive; Automated trading systems; Explanatory power; GARCH models; Log likelihood; News analytics; Numerical index; Trading volumes; Commerce",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84919476648

The model utilizes similarity ratio of the return fractals as the basis for forecasting. We argue that a collection of past returns such as moving average statistics can be 'expanded' to generate future returns through the similarity ratios by trading time multiples. We also argue that stock returns with fractal dimensions in excess of 1.5, the norm for market efficiency, may be prone to frequent jumps and discontinuity. The paper builds an econometrically testable model to estimate fractal dimensions to offer an alternative way to forecast return volatilities without having to estimate separately the bipower variation and the jumps in existing studies. We argue that fractional Brownian motion may be a more suitable description than the standard Wiener process when describing stock return behaviors.

This study demonstrates the existence of predictable short-term trends in the market; understanding the probability of price movement can be useful to high-frequency traders. Price movement was examined in trade-by-trade (tick) data along with temporal timespans between 1 s to 30 min for 52 one-week periods for one highly-traded stock. We hypothesize that much of the initial predictability of trade-by-trade (tick) data is due to traditional market dynamics, or the bouncing of the price between the stock's bid and ask. Only after timespans of between 5 to 10 s does this cease to explain the predictability; after this timespan, two consecutive movements in the same direction occur with higher probability than that of movements in the opposite direction. This pattern holds up to a one-minute interval, after which the strength of the pattern weakens. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Financial economists approach finance theory by focusing on whether to reject a pricing model based on hypothesis tests. However, this approach often fails to capture aspects of the model and latent information in the data that could be potentially useful to the investor. Owing to these limitations, investors have increasingly turned to high-frequency trading as a means of achieving risk-mitigated wealth appreciation. High frequency trading is a strategy that relies on professional proprietary formula-driven trading algorithms to execute millisecond trades using high-speed computers that are placed near or in the proximity of the exchanges to reduce order latency time. The contemporary impact of this new approach has increased the speed and complexity of trading, and has had an impact on market liquidity and transparency. In turn, this has attracted the attention of regulators who are ""Clamping Down on Rapid Trades in the Stock Market"" [3] and the risk of such trades to create volatility by flooding the market with orders before canceling these same orders in fractions of seconds. Facing the possibility of regulatory oversight, many highfrequency automated traders are now turning to the alternative of near high-frequency trading. Instead of focusing on strategies to implement strategic runs in the millisecondenvironment, using the highest resolution data available, near high-frequency trading solves complex econometric models on an instrument by instrument basis to predict the profitability of a future trade. In this paper we present a theory of stochastic price formation to form a behavioral near high frequency automated trading system. The new system is actuated by a combining dual radial basis function artificial neural networks and two fundamental trading metrics. Additionally, because the trading signals are generated by cognitive models, the research calibrates a nonparametric behavioral production function to estimate the quasi elasticity coefficients of a four factor model. © 2013 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Therefore, it is imperative that careful decisions are made regarding the best suited system architecture that meets the software functional requirements (multi-asset, multi-strategy, real-time risk assessment, etc.), and non-functional requirements (autonomy, high-throughput, low-latency, modularity, scalability, etc.). This paper discusses architecture paradigms that can serve as candidates for consideration to design a multi-asset, multi-strategy algorithmic trading system.

Most trading systems have concentrated on using common analytic waveforms and have not taken into consideration phasors and complex variables. The Hilbert transform, often employed to convert signal variables in analytic waveforms to complex variables, will be used for the measurement of market cycles, rather than measurement of market trends. The main objective is to investigate how the periods of the dominant cycle in a cycle mode can be quantified in order to create an amplitude compensation of the In-Phase and Quadrature components, alongside methods of smoothing and de-trending the analytic signal. The subsequent output can be defuzzified using Type 2 Fuzzy-Logic techniques, which will in turn refine the implementation of trading strategies. Type-2 Fuzzy Logic systems are becoming more popular as they account for uncertainties that are not captured within a Type-1 Fuzzy Logic system. These Type-2 systems outperform traditional Fuzzy Logic systems in forecasting problems since they can account for more variables in a more efficient way. © 2013 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

In this way, one can implement a simple trading strategy based on the predicted future value of an asset price or a portfolio and comparing it to the current value. The method is tested on FOREX data series and achieved a considerable profit on the mid price. In the presence of the bid-ask spread, the gain is smaller but it still ranges in the interval 2-6 percent in 6 months without using any leverage. FFNNs were also used to predict future values of mean reverting portfolios after identifying them as Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes. In this way, one can provide fast predictions which can give rise to high frequency trading on intraday data series.","Feedforward Neural Networks; Financial Time Series Prediction; High Frequency Trading","Feedforward neural networks (FFNN); Financial time series; Financial time series predictions; High-frequency trading; Nonlinear estimator; Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process; Prediction-based; Trading strategies; Artificial intelligence; Commerce; Feedforward neural networks; Forecasting; Financial data processing",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84887479488

The main purpose of this study is laid on examining the role of IT based stock trading on financial market efficiency. This research specifically focused on algorithmic trading. Algorithmic trading enables investors to trade stocks through a computer program without the need for human interventions. Based on an empirical analysis of the Korean stock market, this study discovered the positive impact of algorithmic trading on stock market efficiency at three-fold. First, the study results indicate that algorithmic trading contributes to the reduction in asymmetric volatility, which causes inefficiency of information in a stock market. Second, an algorithmic trading also increases the operation efficiency of a stock market. Arbitrage trading contributes on the equilibrium between the spot market and futures market as well as on the price discovery. Third, algorithmic trading provides liquidity for market participants contributing to friction free transactions. The research results indicate that stock exchanges based on electronic communications networks (ECNs) without human intervention could augment a financial market quality by increasing trading share volumes and market efficiency so that it can eventually contribute to the welfare of market investors. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Asymmetric volatility; Efficiency of information; Efficiency of operation; Equilibrium; Liquidity","Algorithmic trading; Algorithmic trading system; Asymmetric volatility; Electronic communications networks; Korean stock market; Liquidity; Market participants; Operation efficiencies; Algorithms; Efficiency; Financial data processing; Information technology; Investments; Phase equilibria; Commerce",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84888046165

We propose a new measure of low-latency activity to investigate the impact of high-frequency trading on the market environment. Our measure is highly correlated with NASDAQ-constructed estimates of high-frequency trading, but it can be computed from widely-available message data. We use this measure to study how low-latency activity affects market quality both during normal market conditions and during a period of declining prices and heightened economic uncertainty. Our analysis suggests that increased low-latency activity improves traditional market quality measures-decreasing spreads, increasing displayed depth in the limit order book, and lowering short-term volatility.

This is a trading outside the regular trading hours of 09:30-16:00. During this time the market is thinly traded and the possibility of price (in)efficiency arises. Price spikes up or down sometimes reaching several percent can be observed. This pattern can be exploited by a simple automated trading strategy that buys low if market drops and closes the position high on the next day when the market reopens. An empirical study using the most liquid stocks and exchange traded funds listed in NASDAQ and NYSE exchanges for the years 2000 to 2012 is conducted. We create a portfolio of ∼400 automated trading strategies. The average portfolio performance is a 23 percent per annum with a Sharpe ratio of 4. This shows that prices are inefficient during after-hours trading in the US stock market.

Such markets have traditionally been utilized by large institutions as an alternative to public exchanges to execute large block orders which might otherwise impact settlement price. It is estimated that the trading volume of dark pool markets was 9% to 12% of the total U.S. equity market share volume in 2010 [1]. This phenomenon raises questions regarding the fundamental value of securities traded through dark pool markets and their impact on the price discovery process in traditional 'visible' markets. In this paper, we establish a modeling framework for dark pool markets through agent-based modeling. It presents and validates the costs and benefits of trading small orders in dark pool markets. Simulated trading of 78 selected stocks demonstrates that dark pool market traders can obtain better execution rate when the dark pool market has more uninformed traders relative to informed traders. In addition, trading stocks with larger market capitalization yields better price improvement in dark pool markets. © 2013 IEEE.","agent-based model; algorithmic trading; Dark pool; informed vs. uninformed trader","Agent-based model; Algorithmic trading; Costs and benefits; Dark pool; informed vs. uninformed trader; Market capitalization; Securities trading; Settlement price; Artificial intelligence; Competition; Computational methods; Costs; Lakes; Commerce",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84886057590

Recently, CPS extensions have been proposed for location-based services like vehicular networks, mobile social networking, and so on. Although current CPS middleware systems are dynamic in the way they support the joining and leaving of publishers and subscribers, they fall short in supporting subscription adaptations. These are becoming increasingly important across many CPS applications. In algorithmic high frequency trading, for instance, stock price thresholds that are of interest to a trader change rapidly, and gains directly hinge on the reaction time to relevant fluctuations rather than fixed values. In location-aware applications, a subscription is a function of the subscriber location (e.g. GPS coordinates), which inherently changes during motion. The common solution for adapting a subscription consists of a resubscription, where a new subscription is issued and the superseded one canceled. This incurs substantial overhead in CPS middleware systems, and leads to missed or duplicated events during the transition. In this article, we explore the concept of parametric subscriptions for capturing subscription adaptations. We discuss desirable and feasible guarantees for corresponding support, and propose novel algorithms for updating routing mechanisms effectively and efficiently in classic decentralized CPS broker overlay networks. Compared to resubscriptions, our algorithms significantly improve the reaction time to subscription updates without hampering throughput or latency under high update rates. We also propose and evaluate approximation techniques to detect and mitigate pathological cases of high frequency subscription oscillations, which could significantly decrease the throughput of CPS systems thereby affecting other subscribers. We analyze the benefits of our support through implementations of our algorithms in two CPS systems, and by evaluating our algorithms on two different application scenarios. © 2013 ACM.","Content-based; Dynamic; Parametric; Publish/subscribe; Subscription oscillations","Approximation techniques; Content-based; Content-based publish; High-frequency trading; Location-aware application; Parametric; Publish/subscribe; Subscription oscillations; Commerce; Dynamics; Location based services; Middleware; Network security; Overlay networks; Algorithms",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84885661509

Design/methodology/approach: The paper is a meta-analysis of the role of investment strategies within complex systems. Findings: The growth of hedge fund investment activity based on statistical arbitrage tends to produce a vulnerability; more funds using the strategy helps to create the profitable outcomes that the strategy relies upon. However, the growth also reduces the time lines of profitability and produces an underlying instability based on overlapping holdings and the use of leverage. The shortened timelines also create a further impetus towards technological competition and promotes high frequency trading, which then introduces further vulnerabilities based on ""stop-loss cascades"". Research limitations/implications: Much of the trading creates a superficial form of liquidity, which gives a limited sense of market vulnerabilities. The basis of complex interactions between high frequency traders is also not clearly understood. Researchers and agents of policy ought to pay greater attention to the issues than is currently the case.

To reduce unhelpful sample size/dimensionality effects, we perform a clustering of N time series and split them into a small number of blocks. Each block is composed of mutually correlated ATSs. It generates an expert trading agent based on a nontrainable 1/ N portfolio rule. To increase the diversity of the expert agents, we use training sets of different lengths for clustering.

In closed systems - such as those found in HPC - Infiniband, iWARP or RoCE are common choices as system architects have the opportunity to choose the best host configurations and networking fabric. However, the vast majority of networks are built upon Ethernet with nodes exchanging data using the standard TCP/IP stack. On such networks, achieving ultra low-latency while maintaining compatibility with a standard TCP/IP stack is crucial. To date, most efforts for low-latency packet transfers have focused on three main areas: (i) avoiding context switches, (ii) avoiding buffer copies, and (iii) off-loading protocol processing. This paper describes IBM PowerENTM and its networking stack, showing that an integrated system design which treats Ethernet adapters as first class citizens that share the system bus with CPUs and memory, rather than as peripheral PCI Express attached devices, is a winning solution for achieving minimal latency.

Significant technological investments have led to dramatic improvements in latency, the delay between a trading decision and the resulting trade execution. We describe a theoretical model for the quantitative valuation of latency. Our model measures the trading frictions created by the presence of latency, by considering the optimal execution problem of a representative investor. Via a dynamic programming analysis, our model provides a closed-form expression for the cost of latency in terms of well-known parameters of the underlying asset. We implement our model by estimating the latency cost incurred by trading on a human time scale. Examining NYSE common stocks from 1995 to 2005 shows that median latency cost across our sample roughly tripled during this time period. Furthermore, using the same data set, we compute a measure of implied latency and conclude that the median implied latency decreased by approximately two orders of magnitude. Empirically calibrated, our model suggests that the reduction in cost achieved by going from trading on a human time scale to a low latency time scale is comparable with other execution costs faced by the most cost efficient institutional investors, and it is consistent with the rents that are extracted by ultra-low latency agents, such as providers of automated execution services or high frequency traders. © 2013 INFORMS.",,"Closed-form expression; Electronic market; High-frequency trading; Human time scale; Institutional investors; Orders of magnitude; Theoretical modeling; Trade execution; Commerce; Costs; Economics; Investments; Time measurement; Cost benefit analysis",Review,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84887246334

We investigate this problem in the context of a trading tournament in which student teams used delta hedging and other mechanisms to attempt to achieve benchmark performance in managing a hedge fund in a simulated market. Our hypothesis is that machine learning models can be trained to solve the apprenticeship learning problem; that is, these models can learn to trade like tournament participants. After reviewing classical return-matching approaches and recent work in inverse reinforcement learning, we propose a supervised learning methodology that makes use of recursive partitioning (RP). Our proposed RP approach is based on a feature representation for actions that, we argue, corresponds to the information structures readily available to tournament participants. RP achieves high accuracy in predicting the type and scale of participant trades and in tracking overall portfolio performance. Our results suggest that further research on our proposed approach is warranted and should include an expansion to testing on data from real markets. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Algorithm trading; Reverse engineering; Trading strategy","financial market; learning; research; student",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84885079056

Conversely, financial questions have stimulated new research directions in probability. In this survey paper, we review some of these developments and point to some areas that might deserve further investigation. We start by reviewing the basics of arbitrage pricing theory, with special emphasis on incomplete markets and on the different roles played by the ""real- world"" probability measure and its equivalent martingale measures. We then focus on the issue of model ambiguity, also called Knightian uncertainty. We present two case studies in which it is possible to deal with Knightian uncertainty in mathematical terms. The first case study concerns the hedging of derivatives, such as variance swaps, in a strictly pathwise sense. The second one deals with capital requirements and preferences specified by convex and coherent risk measures. In the final two sections we discuss mathematical issues arising from the dramatic increase of algorithmic trading in modern financial markets. © 2013 ISI/BS.","Algorithmic trading; Arbitrage pricing theory; Coherent risk measure; Convex risk measure; Hedging; Incomplete market; Knightian uncertainty; Market impact model; Model uncertainty; Monetary measure of risk; Pathwise ItôCalculus; Price impact; Superhedging; Variance swap",,Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84885161254

It is very common in practice that the same problems emerge in different application domains (e.g. the modeling support for complex event processing is desirable in the domain of algorithmic trading, IT security assessment, robust monitoring, etc.). A DSL operates in one single domain, but the above-mentioned cross-domain challenges raise the question: is it possible to automate the design of DSLs which are so closely related? This approach demonstrates how a family of domain-specific languages can be developed for multiple domains from a single generic language metamodel with generative techniques. The basic idea is to refine the targeted domain with separating the problem domain from the context domain. This allows designing a generic language based on the problem and customizing it with the appropriate extensions for arbitrary contexts, thus defining as many DSLs and as many contexts as one extends the generic language for. The authors also present an ontology-based approach for establishing contextspecific domain knowledge bases. The results are discussed through a case study, where a language for event processing is designed and extended for multiple context domains. © 2014 by IGI Global.

When trading analysis of RRL is done with lower frequency financial data, e.g. daily stock prices, the decrease of autocorrelation in prices may lead to a decrease in trading profit. In this paper, we propose a RRL trading system which utilizes the price information, jointly with the indicators from technical analysis, fundamental analysis and econometric analysis, to produce long/short signals for daily trading. In the proposed trading system, we use a genetic algorithm as a pre-screening tool to search suitable indicators for RRL trading. Moreover, we modify the original RRL parameter update scheme in the literature for out-of-sample trading. Empirical studies are conducted based on data sets of 238 S&P stocks. It is found that the trading performance concerning the out-of-sample daily Sharpe ratios turns better: the number of companies with a positive and significant Sharpe ratio increases after feeding the selected indicators jointly with prices information into the RRL system.","Econometric analysis; Fundamental analysis; Genetic algorithm; Recurrent reinforcement learning; Technical analysis","Econometric analysis; Fundamental analysis; High-frequency trading; Indicator selections; Lower frequencies; Machine learning techniques; Recurrent reinforcement learning; Technical analysis; Costs; Genetic algorithms; Reinforcement learning; Commerce",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84882295593

This novel theoretical approach results in an estimator that is genuinely range-based on daily opening, high, low and closing data, unlike current estimators in the literature. The daily price jump at the opening is considered to be the result of the unobserved evolution of an after-hours virtual trading day. In comparison to an existing drift-independent estimator, we find that our estimator is actually more efficient when using a smaller number of data points, while for a larger number of points the efficiency of our estimator stays above 99% of the existing one.

We propose a simple model of latency arbitrage in which a single security is traded on two exchanges, with aggregate information available to regular traders only after some delay. An infinitely fast arbitrageur profits from market fragmentation by reaping the surplus when the two markets diverge due to this latency in cross-market communication. We develop a discrete-event simulation system to capture this processing and information transfer delay, and using an agent-based approach, we simulate the interactions between highfrequency and zero-intelligence trading agents at the millisecond level. We then evaluate allocative efficiency and market liquidity arising from the simulated order streams, and we find that market fragmentation and the presence of a latency arbitrageur reduces total surplus and negatively impacts liquidity. By replacing continuous-time markets with periodic call markets, we eliminate latency arbitrage opportunities and achieve further efficiency gains through the aggregation of orders over short time periods.

Above a particular time-threshold, humans and robots trade with one another; below the threshold all transactions are robot-to-robot. We refer to this abrupt system transition as the 'robot phase transition'. Here, we conduct controlled experiments where human traders interact with 'robot' trading agents in minimal models of electronic financial markets to see if correlates of the two regimes suggested by Johnson et al.

Solutions employing long-running continuous queries executed in-memory show their limits in applications characterized by a staggering growth of available sources that continuously produce new events at high rates (e.g. intrusion detection systems and algorithmic trading). Problems arise due to the complexities in maintaining large amounts of events in memory for continuous elaboration, and due to the difficulties in managing at run-time the network of elaborating nodes. A batch approach to this kind of computation provides a viable solution for scenarios characterized by non frequent computations of very large time windows. In this paper we propose a model for batch processing in time window event computations that allows the definition of multiple metrics for performance optimization. These metrics specifically take into account the organization of input data to minimize its impact on computation latency. The model is then instantiated on Hadoop, a batch processing engine based on the MapReduce paradigm, and a set of strategies for efficiently arranging input data is described and evaluated.

Clearly, automated trading systems can easily be considered as ""intelligent"" software agents. In this paper we report on experiments with software trader-agents running the well-known ""AA"" and ""ZIP"" strategies, often used as reference benchmarks in previously published studies; here we suggest disambiguated standard implementations of these algorithms. Then, using Exchange Portal (ExPo), an open-source financial exchange simulation platform designed for real-time behavioural economic experiments involving human traders and/or trader-agents, we explore the impact of introducing a new method for assignment adaptation in ZIP. Results show that markets containing only assignment-adaptive (ASAD) agents equilibrate more quickly after market shocks than markets containing only ""standard"" ZIP agents. However, perhaps counter-intuitively, in mixed heterogeneous populations of ASAD agents and ZIP agents, ZIP agents outperform ASAD agents. Evidence suggests that the behaviour of ASAD agents act as a new signal in the market that ZIP agents then use to beneficially alter their own behaviour, to the detriment of the ASAD agents themselves.","Auctions; Automated trading; Computational finance; ExPo; Financial markets; Software agents","Auctions; Automated trading; Computational finance; ExPo; Financial market; Artificial intelligence; Automation; Exhibitions; Experiments; Finance; Software agents; Commerce",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84877994317

An extreme case is high-frequency trading whereby saving a fraction of millisecond over a route between Chicago and New York can be a game-changer. While such communications are often carried by fiber, microwave links can reduce transmission delays over large distances due to more direct routes and faster wave propagation. In order to bridge large distances, information is sent over a multihop relay network. Motivated by these applications, this papers present an information-theoretic approach to the design of optimal multihop microwave networks that minimizes end-to-end transmission delay. To characterize the delay introduced by coding, we derive error exponents achievable in multihop networks. We formulate and solve an optimization problem that determines optimal selection of amplify-and-forward and decode-and-forward relays. We present the optimal solution for several examples of networks. We prove that in high SNR the optimum transmission scheme is for all relays to perform amplify-and-forward. We then analyze the impact of deploying noisy feedback. © 2013 IEEE.",,"Communication schemes; Decode-and-forward relay; End-to-end transmission; High-frequency trading; Information-theoretic approach; Low-latency communication; Multi-hop relay networks; Optimization problems; Information theory; Optimization; Wave propagation; Transmissions",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84877669856

The arborescence must obey delay bounds for each r-t-path (t ∈ T), where the path delay is imposed by its total edge length and its inner vertices. We want to minimize the total length. Computing such arborescences is a central step in timing optimization of VLSI design where the problem is known as the repeater tree problem [1,5]. We prove that there is no constant factor approximation algorithm unless and develop a bicriteria approximation algorithm trading off signal speed (shallowness) and total length (lightness). The latter generalizes results of [8,3], which do not consider vertex delays.

Even as computerized tools undoubtedly provide individual investors with more power relative to what they had before, they also provide powerful actors with relatively more power as well, in some cases effectively excluding the majority of individuals from insight or meaningful participation whatsoever, especially with regard to the political impacts of market activities. Reports on recent financial crises, and the 2011 film Margin Call provide narrow windows into the operations of HFT and the challenges it poses to democracy; these in turn raise significant problems for the view that computerization inherently democratizes. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","automation; capitalism; computerization; democratization; digital media; finance; high-frequency trading; new media; securities trading",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84878124229

Air guidance in hollow-core fibres can reduce fibre latency very significantly. However, state-of-the-art technology cannot achieve the combined values of loss, bandwidth and mode-coupling characteristics required for high-capacity data transmission.

Our approach uses state-of-the-art Semantic Web technology for handling temporal data. Through such an approach, the designer of a system can focus on the application intelligence rather than enforcing/checking data related restrictions manually. Also, there is an increased support for reuse of temporal reasoning tools across applications. We illustrate the applicability of our framework by building a market recommendations aggregation system. This system automatically collects market recommendations from online sources and, based on the past performance of the analysts that issued a recommendation, generates an aggregated recommendation in the form of a buy, hold, or sell advice.

The hereto paper compares two types of agent-based models, one with zero-intelligence traders and the other with intelligent traders in order to simulate the tick-by-tick high frequency trades on the stock market for the selected U.S. stocks. The simulations of the agent-based models are done with the help of Adaptive Modeler software application which uses the interaction of 2,000 heterogeneous agents to create a virtual stock market for the selected stock with the scope of forecasting the price. Within the intelligent agent-based model the population of agents is continuously adapting and evolving by using genetic programming in forming new agents by using the trading strategies of the best performing agents and replacing the worst performing agents in a process called breeding, while the zero-intelligence agent based model does not evolve, agents do not breed, and they trade in a random manner. After comparing the fitting of the two models with the real data, the results show that in almost all the cases the intelligent agent-based model performed better when compared to the zero-intelligence agent-based model, which could be interpreted as lower market efficiency, allowing for predictions of the stock market price, or even stock market manipulation. Also, the zero-intelligent agent-based model generates more trades and lower wealth for the population, compared to the intelligent agentbased model. The high-frequency data turns out to be very hard to simulate and analyse due to its particularities which differentiate them from daily data, as price changes are discrete, being multiples of the minimum price increment, the price changes not being independent.","Agent-based modeling; Double auction; Financial market; High frequency trading; Zero-intelligence traders",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84886771683

What does it mean for a financial market to be ""fair""? We first examine how high frequency trading is actually used. High frequency traders often implement traditional beneficial strategies such as market making and arbitrage, although computers can also be used for manipulative strategies as well. We then examine different notions of fairness. Procedural fairness can be viewed from the perspective of equal opportunity, in which all market participants are treated alike. The same rules apply to HFT as to other traders. Another approach to fairness is in the equality of outcomes. Many HFT strategies are beneficial to other market participants, so one cannot categorically denounce the practice as unfair. Other strategies, for both high and low frequency trading, are not. It is thus important to distinguish between the technology and the use of the technology to make judgments on fairness. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Fairness; Financial markets; High frequency trading; Justice; Manipulation",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84874792183

The most prominent example of an HFT environment is within equity trading, where many millions of trades are achieved at a high volume to gain a reasonable cumulative profit. Such environments rely on low latency/high performance technologies to allow trades to react in a timely manner to market volatility. However, sometimes the volatility of the market goes beyond what supporting infrastructure can allow, resulting in erroneous behaviour of the marketplace. In this paper we tackle the problem of managing market volatility to limit erroneous market behaviour. Our approach is unique in that it is non-dependent on the trading environment itself and self-regulates based only on trading frequency and contention. We demonstrate our results and show that by managing trade injection rates and contention of shared state the volatility of HFT environments can be managed appropriately and in an automated manner. © 2013 IEEE.","Eventual consistency; High frequency trading; Replication","Information science; Algorithmic trading; Eventual consistency; High-frequency trading; Market behaviours; Market volatility; Performance technologies; Replication; Trading environments; Commerce",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84898659804

The fault lines have been present for quite some time; however, it is only now, in the last few years that the ramifications of these displacements have been felt. The traditional approach to investing has gone from a focus on investing – namely examining companies to determine whether they will be a good long-term investment – to examining the markets as a whole. Nowhere is this shift more apparent than in the rise and increasing prevalence of quantitative trading models. As a result, there is now a disconnect between the markets themselves and the companies that are traded on the markets. Oftentimes, what a company does or does not do matters very little to whether that company’s stock should be bought or sold. Instead, whether that company’s stock is a good “buy” amounts more to how that stock is doing and how the market is behaving. This shift has broad implications for retail and institutional investor behavior, regulatory structures and the role of government in oversight and, if unchecked, the global economy at large. The ever-changing advances in computer technology have fostered a new breed of trading that is much more reliant on quantitative mathematics than on corporate analysis. This article explores algorithmic trading and assesses the impact of its dominance on regulation of the securities markets and their stability in the global economy. © 2013, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Algorithmic trading; Computer trading; High frequency trading; Securities regulation",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84886383038

The bid-ask spread of the LOB is modeled by a tick-valued continuous-time Markov chain. We consider a small agent who continuously submits limit buy/sell orders at best bid/ask quotes, and may also set limit orders at best bid (resp. ask) plus (resp. minus) a tick for obtaining execution order priority, which is a crucial issue in high-frequency trading. The agent faces an execution risk since her limit orders are executed only when they meet counterpart market orders. She is also subject to inventory risk due to price volatility when holding the risky asset. The agent can then also choose to trade with market orders, and therefore obtain immediate execution, but at a less favorable price. The objective of the market maker is to maximize her expected utility from revenue over a short-term horizon by a trade-off between limit and market orders, while controlling her inventory position. This is formulated as a mixed regime switching regular/impulse control problem that we characterize in terms of a quasi-variational system by dynamic programming methods. Calibration procedures are derived for estimating the transition matrix and intensity parameters for the spread and for Cox processes modelling the execution of limit orders. We provide an explicit backward splitting scheme for solving the problem and show how it can be reduced to a system of simple equations involving only the inventory and spread variables. Several computational tests are performed both on simulated and real data, and illustrate the impact and profit when considering execution priority in limit orders and market orders. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","Applied mathematical finance; Market microstructure; Portfolio optimization; Quantitative finance techniques; Stochastic control; Trading strategies",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84871320328

Considering a state-space model that describes the spread (data stream) as the difference of the prices of two assets, we propose two new recursive least squares (RLS) algorithms for predicting mean-reversion of the spread in real time. The first is a combination of steepest descent RLS and Gauss-Newton RLS, for which we extend previous work by providing exact recursive equations to update the variable forgetting factor (VFF). We propose a new RLS algorithm for variable forgetting, by transforming the prediction errors into a binary process and adopting Bayesian methods for inference. The new approach is versatile as compared to more traditional RLS schemes, having the advantage of uncertainty analysis around the VFF. The methods are illustrated with real data, consisting of daily prices of Target Corporation and Walmart Stores Inc shares, over a period of 6 years. Alongside the detection of mean-reversion of the spread, we implement a simple trading strategy. The empirical results suggest that the new Bayesian approach returns are in excess of 130% cumulative profit over a period of 2 years. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2013.","Adaptive filtering; Market-neutral trading; Mean-reversion; Pairs trading; Recursive least squares; Statistical arbitrage; Variable forgetting factor","Adaptive filtering; Algorithms; Bayesian networks; Data communication systems; Pattern recognition; Uncertainty analysis; Market-neutral trading; Mean-reversion; Pairs trading; Recursive least square (RLS); Statistical arbitrage; Variable forgetting factors; Commerce",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84883379364

The revenue collected as a result of market participants' desire to purchase the right to cancel orders, is aggregated into an automated, self-managed LOB bank. The LOB accesses its bank and an accumulated order inventory in times of low liquidity. Low liquidity in this context is characterized by an imbalance of orders in the ask (bid) partition of the LOB relative to the bid (ask) partition. To compensate for this imbalance, the proposed LOB design is enhanced with a new market feature capable of assessing and improving its stability through absorbing selected orders. We perform extensive simulation experiments to characterize the ability of the proposed design to stabilize the LOB. © 2013 IEEE.","High frequency trading; Limit order book; Simulation","Electronic commerce; Electronic trading; Digital cancellation; Extensive simulations; High-frequency trading; Limit order book; Limit order markets; Market participants; Self-provisioning; Simulation; Correlation theory",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84893239207

The ecosystem of an open outcry market was well-known, visible to a human eye, and rigidly prescribed. Now trading is increasingly done in anonymous electronic markets where traders do not have designated functions or mandatory roles. In fact, the traders themselves have been replaced by algorithms (machines) operating with little or no human oversight. While the process of electronic trading is not visible to a human eye, machine-learning methods have been developed to recognize persistent patterns in the data. In this study, we develop a dynamic machine-learning method that designates traders in an anonymous electronic market into five persistent categories: high frequency traders, market makers, opportunistic traders, fundamental traders, and small traders. Our method extends a plaid clustering technique with a smoothing framework that filters out transient patterns. The method is fast, robust, and suitable for a discovering trading ecosystems in a large number of electronic markets. © 2013 - IOS Press and the authors.

They are widely used in high-frequency trading, seismic analysis and neuroscience. A critical numerical calculation in Hawkes process models is parameter estimation, which is used to fit a Hawkes process model to a data set. The parameter estimation problem can be solved by searching for a parameter set that maximises the log-likelihood. A core operation of this search process, the log-likelihood evaluation, is computationally demanding if the number of data points is large. To accelerate the computation, we present a log-likelihood evaluation strategy which is suitable for hardware acceleration. We then design and optimise a pipelined engine based on our proposed strategy. In the experiments, an FPGA-based implementation of the proposed engine is shown to be up to 72 times faster than a single-core CPU, and 10 times faster than an 8-core CPU. © 2013 IEEE.",,"Engines; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Parameter estimation; Evaluation strategies; FPGA-based implementation; Hardware acceleration; High-frequency trading; Numerical calculation; Occurrence pattern; Parameter estimation problems; Probabilistic models; Maximum likelihood estimation",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84898632813

By setting a threshold for the power spectrum, the model extracts the periodic and nonperiodic components from the original volume series and then predicts them. By analyzing samples from four major stock indices, we find that a too small threshold and a too large threshold cause negative effects on the performance of the FFT model. Appropriate thresholds are found at approximately the 93rd to 95th percentile for the four indices studied. The out-of-sample experiment for the 50 stocks of the Shanghai 50 Composite Index shows that the FFT model is superior to the classic moving average model in terms of both volume prediction and Volume-weighted Average Price (VWAP) tracking accuracy. Meanwhile, for almost all of the 50 stocks, the FFT model outperforms the Bialkowski et al. (2008) model in terms of volume-prediction accuracy. The two models perform comparably in terms of the VWAP tracking error. © 2013 Korean Securities Association.","Algorithmic trading; Fast fourier transform; Intraday volume prediction; Volume-weighted average price strategy",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84901353272

Affective processing and affective input/output are key tools in artificial intelligence and computing. In the designing of processing elements (e.g. bits, bytes, floats, etc.), engineers have primarily focused on the processing efficiency and power. They then go on to investigate ways of making them perceivable by the user/engineer. However Human-Computer Interaction research – and the increasing pervasiveness of computation in our daily lives – supports a complementary approach in which computational efficiency and power are more balanced with understandability to the user/engineer. PMP allows a user to tap into the processing path to hear a sample of what is going on in that affective computation, as well as providing a simpler way to interface with affective input/output systems. This requires the developing of new approaches to processing and interfacing PMP-based modules. In this chapter we introduce PMP and examine the approach using three example: a military robot team simulation with an affective subsystem, a text affective-content estimation system, and a stock market tool. © 2013, Springer-Verlag London.","Affective State; Algorithmic Trading; News Story; Spike Neural Network; Virtual Machine",,Book Chapter,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84963782456

Network operators today lack sufficient fine-grain measurement tools to detect, localize, and repair delay spikes that cause application service level agreement (SLA) violations. A recently proposed solution called LDA provides a scalable way to obtain latency, but only provides aggregate measurements. However, debugging application-specific problems requires per-flow measurements since different flows may exhibit significantly different characteristics even when they are traversing the same link. To enable fine-grained per-flow measurements in routers, we propose a new scalable architecture called reference latency interpolation (RLI) that is based on our observation that packets potentially belonging to different flows that are closely spaced to each other exhibit similar delay properties. In our evaluation using simulations over real traces, we show that while having small overhead, RLI achieves a median relative error of 12% and one to two orders of magnitude higher accuracy than previous per-flow measurement solutions. We also observe RLI achieves as high accuracy as LDA in aggregate latency estimation, and RLI outperforms LDA in standard deviation estimation. © 1993-2012 IEEE.","Latency; Measurements; Per-flow; Router; Switch","Algorithmic trading; Application services; High-performance computing; Latency; Orders of magnitude; Per-flow; Scalable architectures; Standard deviation; Aggregates; Computer architecture; Flow measurement; Interpolation; Repair; Routers; Switches; Measurements",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84887100685

For instance, some investors prefer to have a lower bound risk rather than gaining a higher return. In portfolio theory, it is commonly assumed the existence of one risk free asset that offers a positive return. This theoretical risk free asset combined with a risky portfolio creates a new portfolio that presents a linear relation between risk and return as the risk free asset weight (w f ) changes. Hence, any level of risk or of return is easy to achieve separately, just by changing w f . However, in a world without any risk free assets, the combination between assets creates nonlinear portfolios. Achieving a specific level of risk or return is not a trivial task. In this paper, we assume a risky world rather than the existence of a risk free asset, in order to model an automated asset management system. Furthermore, some automated asset managers give very different results when evolving in different contexts: hence, a very profitable manager can have very bad results in other market situations. This paper presents a multiagent architecture, aiming to tackle these problems. The architecture, named COAST (COmpetitive Agent SocieTy), is based on competitive agents that act autonomously on behalf of an investor in financial asset management. It allows the simultaneous and competitive use of several asset analysis techniques currently applied in the finance field. Some dedicated agents, called advisors, apply a particular technique to a single asset. The results provided by these advisors are then submitted to and analyzed by a special agent called coach, who evaluates its advisors' performance and defines an expectation about the future price of one specific asset. Within COAST, several coaches negotiate to define the best money allocation among different assets, by using a negotiation protocol defined in this paper. We also propose an investor description model that is able to represent different investors' preferences with defined acceptable limits of risk and/or return. The COAST architecture was designed to operate adequately with any possible investor's preference. It was implemented using a financial market simulator called AgEx and tested using real data from the Nasdaq stock exchange. The test results show that the architecture performed well when compared to an adjusted market index. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Automated asset management; Automated trading; Multiagent architectures; Multiagent systems","Analysis techniques; Asset management systems; Automated trading; Competitive agents; Cooperative agents; Investors' preferences; Multiagent architecture; Negotiation protocol; Architecture; Automation; Autonomous agents; Commerce; Investments; Management; Managers; Multi agent systems; Profitability; Risk perception",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84878472178

To satisfy the need, researchers have proposed new architectures such as LDA and RLI that can provide fine-grained latency measurements. However, these architectures are fundamentally ossified in their design as they are designed to provide only a specific pre-configured aggregate measurement - -either average latency across all packets (LDA) or per-flow latency measurements (RLI). Network operators, however, need latency measurements at both finer (e.g., packet) as well as flexible (e.g., flow subsets) levels of granularity. To bridge this gap, we propose an architecture called MAPLE that essentially stores packet-level latencies in routers and allows network operators to query the latency of arbitrary traffic sub-populations. MAPLE is built using scalable data structures with small storage needs (uses only 12.8 bits/packet), and uses a novel mechanism to reduce the query bandwidth significantly (by a factor of 17 compared to the naive method of sending packet queries individually). © 2012 ACM.","approximation; bloom filter; latency","Algorithmic trading; approximation; Bloom filters; High-performance computing; latency; Network Monitoring; Network operator; Packet latencies; Scalable architectures; Sub-populations; Computer architecture; Computer software selection and evaluation; Data structures; Network architecture",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84870925234

To this end, we present a domain-independent framework based on a protocol development lifecycle, comprising four distinct phases namely modeling, verification, rule-based implementation and generic execution. We illustrate all phases by introducing the Simple Bilateral Negotiation Protocol (SBNP) - a multi-tier, multi-round and customizable negotiation protocol.

It also proposes a design for a market simulator and suggests the requirements a market simulator should have in order to accommodate the richness and complexity in the structure of financial markets. Finally, the mechanisms to observe how effectively the simulation works are discussed. © 2012 IEEE.","Financial Markets; High frequency trading; Risks; Simulation","Financial market; High-frequency trading; Market simulation; Market simulators; Potential risks; Simulation; Technological advancement; Trading mechanism; Finance; Risk management; Risks; Technology; Commerce",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84875546046

Instead of focusing only on the scheduling aspect like Almgren and Chriss in [J. Risk, 3 (2000), pp. 5-39], or only on the liquidity-consuming orders like Obizhaeva and Wang in [Optimal Trading Strategy and Supply/Demand Dynamics, SSRN eLibrary, 2005], we link the optimal trade schedule to the price of the limit orders that have to be sent to the limit order book to optimally liquidate a portfolio. Most practitioners address these two issues separately: they compute an optimal trading curve, and they then send orders to the markets to try to follow it. The results obtained in this paper can be interpreted and used in two ways: (i) we solve simultaneously the two problems and provide a strategy to liquidate a portfolio over a few hours, and (ii) we provide a tactic for following a trading curve over slices of a few minutes. As far as the model is concerned, the interactions of limit orders with the market are modeled via a point process pegged to a diffusive ""fair price."" A Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation is used to solve the control problem involving both nonexecution risk and price risk. Backtests are carried out to exemplify the use of our results, both on long periods of time (for the entire liquidation process) and on slices of 5 minutes (to follow a given trading curve).

This is particularly important in systematic/algorithmic/ automated trading applications where instead of assets, automated trading systems are used. We propose a much faster heuristic approach that scales linearly rather than the quadratic scaling in the Markowitz method. Moreover, our proposed approach, Comgen, is on average better than the Markowitz approach when applied to unseen data. Additionally, Comgen always finds a solution, whereas the Markowitz procedure occasionally fails as the covariance matrix is not always positive-semidefinite. In an empirical study of a ∼2000 day history, we demonstrate the benefits of this novel approach by using ∼3200 time series produced by automatic trading systems. We perform a 3 year walk-forward analysis and show that in most of the 12́3=36 months out of the sample periods, this novel approach produces a better Sharpe ratio than the Markowitz approach, at the same time being a thousand times faster (and 2400 times faster if number of assets is 4000). © 2012 IEEE.","algorithmic trading; automated trading systems; comgen; covariance matrix; forward selection; heuristic; large scale; Markowitz; mean variance optimisation; portfolio construction; portfolio optimisation; systematic trading","Algorithmic trading; Automated trading systems; comgen; Forward selection; heuristic; large scale; Markowitz; Optimisations; Portfolio optimisation; systematic trading; Automation; Biomedical engineering; Covariance matrix; Heuristic methods; Information science; Optimization; Commerce",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84886415200

In this respect, financial markets of the 21st century are different to markets of previous centuries. Fuelled by discussions on their possible risks, there is a need for research on the effects of automated trading agents on market efficiency and on human traders. In order to systematically investigate these issues, we introduce a market framework for human-computer interaction. This framework is then applied in a case study on a financial market scenario. In particular, we plan to conduct a NeuroIS experiment in which we analyze overall market efficiency as well as the trading behavior and emotional responses of human traders when they interact with computerized trading agents.","Auction; Electronic markets; Experiments; Framework; Human-computer interaction; NeuroIS","Auction; Automated trading; Electronic market; Emotional response; Framework; Market efficiency; NeuroIS; Strategic interactions; Experiments; Finance; Financial data processing; Human computer interaction; Information systems; Commerce",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84886448710

In equity markets, algorithmic trading has already bypass human traders in terms of traded volume. This trend seems to be irreversible, and other asset classes are also quickly becoming dominated by the machine traders. However, for asset that requires deeper understanding of physicality, like the trading of commodities, human traders still have significant edge over machines. The primary advantage of human traders in such market is the qualitative expert knowledge that requires traders to consider not just the financial information, but also a wide variety of physical constraints and information. However, due to rapid technology changes and the ""invasion"" of cash-rich hedge funds, even this traditionally human-centric asset class is crying for help in handling increasingly complicated and volatile environment. In this paper, we propose an adaptive trading support framework that allows us to quantify expert's knowledge to help human traders. Our method is based on a two-state switching Kalman filter, which updates its state estimation continuously with real-time information. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in palm oil trading, which is becoming more and more complicated in recent years due to its new usage in producing biofuel. We show that the two-state switching Kalman filter tuned with expert domain knowledge can effectively reduce prediction errors when compared against traditional single-state econometric models. With a simple back test, we also demonstrate that even a slight decrease in the prediction errors can lead to significant improvement in the trading performance of a naive trading algorithm. © 2012 IEEE.","autonomous trading; commodity trading; switching Kalman filter","Algorithmic trading; autonomous trading; commodity trading; Financial information; Physical constraints; Prediction errors; Real-time information; Volatile environments; Algorithms; Errors; Intelligent agents; Kalman filters; Commerce",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84878429230

Identifying and understanding the impact of algorithmic trading on financial markets has become a critical issue for market operators and regulators. We propose to characterize traders' behavior in terms of the reward functions most likely to have given rise to the observed trading actions. Our approach is to model trading decisions as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), and use observations of an optimal decision policy to find the reward function. This is known as Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL), and a variety of approaches for this problem are known. Our IRL-based approach to characterizing trader behavior strikes a balance between two desirable features in that it captures key empirical properties of order book dynamics and yet remains computationally tractable. Using an IRL algorithm based on linear programming, we are able to achieve more than 90% classification accuracy in distinguishing High Frequency Trading from other trading strategies in experiments on a simulated E-Mini S&P 500 futures market. The results of these empirical tests suggest that High Frequency Trading strategies can be accurately identified and profiled based on observations of individual trading actions. © 2012 IEEE.","Algorithmic trading; High Frequency Trading; Inverse Reinforcement Learning; Limit order book; Markov Decision Process; Price impact; Spoofing","Algorithmic trading; High frequency; Inverse reinforcement learning; Limit order book; Markov Decision Processes; Price impacts; Spoofing; Algorithms; Artificial intelligence; Correlation theory; Finance; Inverse problems; Markov processes; Reinforcement learning; Commerce",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84869779430

All models were configured as binary classifiers, using a simple buy-and-hold trading strategy, and followed a supervised training scheme.

Major failures in the financial markets can now occur at super-human speeds, as was witnessed in the ""Flash Crash"" of May 6 th 2010. Events such as the Flash Crash may become more commonplace in future, unless lessons are learned from other fields where complex adaptive socio-technical systems-of-systems have to be engineered for high-integrity, safety-critical applications. In this document we review the literature on failures in risky technology and high-integrity approaches to safety-critical SoS engineering. We conclude with an argument that, in the specific case of the global financial markets, there is an urgent need to develop major national strategic modeling and predictive simulation capabilities, comparable to national-scale meteorological monitoring and modeling capabilities. The intent here is not to predict the price-movements of particular financial instruments or asset classes, but rather to provide test-rigs for principled evaluation of systemic risk, estimating probability density functions over spaces of possible outcomes, and thereby identifying potentially high-consequence failure modes in the simulations, before they occur in real life, by which time it is typically too late. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.","algorithmic trading; financial markets; flash crash; high-frequency trading; Large-scale complex IT systems; normalization of deviance; ultra-large-scale systems","Algorithmic trading; Financial market; flash crash; High frequency HF; IT system; Normalization of deviance; Commerce; Finance; Large scale systems; Probability density function; Risk perception; Safety engineering; Information technology",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84868359336

As news can improve the returns generated by algorithmic trading, there is a growing need to use online news information in algorithmic trading in order to react real-time to market events. The biggest challenge is to automate the recognition of financial events from Web news items as an important input next to stock prices for algorithmic trading. In this position paper, we propose a multi-disciplinary approach to financial events recognition in news for algorithmic trading called FERNAT, using techniques from finance, text mining, artificial intelligence, and the Semantic Web. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.",,"Algorithmic trading; Financial events; High productivity; Low costs; Multi-disciplinary approach; Online news; Position papers; Stock price; Text mining; Algorithms; Artificial intelligence; Data mining; Finance; Commerce",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84868317371

New assumptions presented can form a foundation for positive research under this revolutionary paradigm, one almost completely ignored in the financial literature. The traditional financial literature rests on the assumption of normality of inputs, while trading systems aspire to the more rigorous engineering standard of justification.

Usually, the variance of the execution cost is taken as a proxy of risk. The problem of this approach is that variance being a symmetric measure of risk disregard the fact that investors only considered as risky cost realizations that are higher than an expected target value. This fact becomes even more sensitive when the return distribution is nonnormal, negatively skewed, or leptokurtic. In this paper, we propose the use of the conditional value-at-risk of the execution cost as risk measure, which allows for taking only the unfavorable part of the return distribution, or equivalently unwanted high cost, into consideration. © 2012 IEEE.",,"Algorithmic trading; Conditional Value-at-Risk; High costs; Nonnormal; Optimal strategies; Risk measures; Target values; Algorithms; Signal processing; Wireless telecommunication systems; Costs",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84868018756

Most AT evaluation methods range from running the AT strategies against historical data (back testing) to evaluating them on simulated markets. The contribution of the work presented in this paper is twofold. First we investigated different types of agent-based market simulations and suggested how to identify the most suitable market simulation type, based on the specific market model to be investigated. Then we proposed an extended model of the Bayesian execution strategy. We implemented and assessed this model using our tool AlTraSimBa (Algorithmic Trading Simulation Back testing) against the standard Bayesian execution strategy and naive execution strategies, for momentum markets and random markets. The results revealed useful insights on the trade-offs between the frequency of decision making and more complex decision criteria, on one side, and the negative outcome of lost trading on the agents' side due to them not participating actively in the market for some of the execution steps. © 2012 C.E.S.A.M.E.S.","Algorithmic Trading; backtesting; Bayesian adaptive agents; simulation","Adaptive agents; Agent based; Agent-based model; Algorithmic trading; backtesting; Complex decision; Evaluation methods; Execution strategies; Extended model; Historical data; Market model; Market simulation; simulation; Algorithms; Computer simulation; Statistical tests; Commerce",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84867952229

These changes occurred earlier for NASDAQ stocks (primarily between 1994 and 2004) and later for NYSE-listed stocks (mostly following Reg NMS and the 2006 introduction of the NYSE hybrid market). This paper surveys the evidence of how these changes impacted market quality and shows that overall market quality has improved significantly, including bid-ask spreads, liquidity, and transitory price impacts (measured by short-term variance ratios). The greater improvement in market quality for NYSE-listed stocks relative to NASDAQ stocks beginning in 2006 suggests causal links between the staggered market structure changes and market quality. Using proprietary data sets, provided by two exchanges, that identify the activity of high frequency trading firms, studies show these firms contributed directly to narrowing bid-ask spreads, increasing liquidity, and reducing intraday transitory pricing errors and intraday volatility.

In federal securities regulation, the EMH has offered a theoretical construct to accompany the general belief in the value of accurate and complete information that has animated the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) since its creation. Specific applications of the EMH have been straightforward and predictable: For instance, its tenets as to market processing of public information helped motivate the streamlining of procedural requirements as to corporate disclosures and, more controversially, as to private securities class action lawsuits. In state corporate law, the EMH has influenced developments as to takeovers and the corporate objective. In contrast, the EMH and related learning have failed to sufficiently inform governmental actions to address financial illiteracy. Belief in the EMH and the value of efficient markets has weakened in the face of recent market anomalies and stress. The May 2010 flash crash is not easily reconciled with the EMH, and related phenomena such as high frequency trading involve an equity market microstructure far different from the microstructure at the time the EMH emerged. Actions motivated by the global financial crisis (GFC), such as the SEC short-selling ban in September 2008, arguably suggest a greater willingness to subordinate market efficiency in favor of other governmental goals. A range of important EMH-related issues loom beyond those associated with financial illiteracy, the equity market microstructure, and governmental goals. Foremost are those relating to the informational predicate on which market efficiency rests. One key aspect of the informational predicate relates to the disclosure challenges associated with financial innovations (such as asset-backed securities) and business entities heavily involved in financial innovation activities (such as certain money center banks). The quotintermediary depiction modelquot that the SEC has always used is inadequate in financial innovation-related contexts. Another key aspect relates to the massive amounts of information that the Dodd-Frank Act requires to be provided to governmental bodies.

For many years, many manifestations of TF such as a software program called Turtle Trader, for example, emerged in the industry. Surprisingly little has been studied in academic research about its algorithms and applications. Unlike financial forecasting, TF does not predict any market movement; instead it identifies a trend at early time of the day, and trades automatically afterwards by a pre-defined strategy regardless of the moving market directions during run time. Trend following trading has been popular among speculators. However it remains as a trading method where human judgment is applied in setting the rules (aka the strategy) manually. Subsequently the TF strategy is executed in pure objective operational manner. Finding the correct strategy at the beginning is crucial in TF. This usually involves human intervention in first identifying a trend, and configuring when to place an order and close it out, when certain conditions are met. In this paper, we evaluated and compared a collection of TF algorithms that can be programmed in a computer system for automated trading. In particular, a new version of TF called trend recalling model is presented. It works by partially matching the current market trend with one of the proven successful patterns from the past.

Our four main findings are: (i) The price impact of liquidity trades is higher in the presence of the HFTs and is increasing with the size of the trade. In particular, we show that HFTs reduce (increase) the prices that LTs receive when selling (buying) their equity holdings. (ii) Although PTs lose revenue in every trade intermediated by HFTs, they are compensated with a higher liquidity discount in the market price. (iii) HF trading increases the microstructure noise of prices. (iv) The volume of trades increases as the HFTs intermediate trades between the LTs and PTs. This additional volume is a consequence of trades which are carefully tailored for surplus extraction and are neither driven by fundamentals nor is it noise trading. In equilibrium, HF trading and PTs coexist as competition drives down the profits for new HFTs while the presence of HFTs does not drive out traditional PTs. © 2012 World Scientific Publishing Company and Midwest Finance Association.","execution costs; flash trading; High frequency traders; high frequency trading; institutional investors; liquidity traders; market microstructure; market quality; microstructure volatility",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84886308025

Our argument in this paper is that the material aspects of these arrangements - and particularly the materiality of prices - need far closer attention than they normally receive. We develop this argument by highlighting two features of new assemblages that have been created in financial markets since 1999. First, these assemblages give sharp economic significance to spatial location and to physical phenomena such as the speed of light (the physics of these assemblages is Einsteinian, not Newtonian, so to speak). Second, they have provoked fierce controversy focusing on ultra-fast 'high-frequency trading', controversy in which issues of materiality are interwoven intimately with questions of legitimacy, particularly of fairness. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","actor network theory; electronic market-making; finance; high-frequency trading; liquidity; markets; materiality; social studies of finance; technology",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84863632617

Trend following trading has a long and successful history among speculators. The traditional TF trading method is by human judgment in setting the rules (aka the strategy). Subsequently the TF strategy is executed in pure objective operational manner. Finding the correct strategy at the beginning is crucial in TF. This usually involves human intervention in first identifying a trend, and configuring when to place an order and close it out, when certain conditions are met. In this paper, we presented a new type of TF, namely Trend Recalling algorithm that operates in a totally automated manner. It works by partially matching the current trend with one of the proven successful patterns from the past. Our experiments based on real stock market data show that this algorithm has an edge over the other trend following methods in profitability. The new algorithm is also compared to time-series forecasting type of stock trading, and it can even outperform the best forecasting type in a simulation. © 2012 ACADEMY PUBLISHER.","Automated Stock Market Trading; Trend Following Algorithm",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84873600428

The simulation results show that this mechanism can reproduce fat-tailed distributions of returns without ad-hoc behavioral assumptions on agents.

SAQ-Learning algorithm is an improved version of Q-Learning algorithm that benefits from the Metropolis criterion of Simulated Annealing (SA) algorithm to overcome the challenge of finding a balance between exploration and exploitation. Q-Learning is one the most important types of Reinforcement Learning (RL) because of the fact that it does not need the transition model of the environment. Artificial Intelligence (AI) approaches have attracted interest in solving bargaining problem. This is because Game Theory (GT) needs some unrealistic assumptions to solve bargaining problem. Presence of perfectly rational agents is an example of these assumptions. Therefore by designing SAQ-Learning agents to bargain with each other over price, we gained higher performance in case of settlement rate, average payoff, and the time an agent needs to find his optimal policy.

Thus, we consider a trading strategy that breaks the order into small pieces and execute them over a predetermined period of time so as to minimize the overall execution shortfall while matching or exceeding major execution benchmarks such as the volume-weighted average price (VWAP).

(2012a) have developed a new measure of order flow toxicity called Volume-Synchronized Probability of Informed Trading or VPIN. Order flow toxicity makes reference to adverse selection risk but applied to the world of high frequency trading (HFT). We provide a detailed description of the VPIN estimation procedure paying special attention to the main innovations introduced and the key variables of this novel tool. By using a sample of stocks listed on the Spanish market, we compare VPIN to PIN. Although VPIN metric is conceived for the HFT environment, our results suggest that certain VPIN specifications provide proxies for adverse selection risk similar to those obtained by the PIN model. Thus, we consider that the key variable in the VPIN procedure is the number of buckets used and that VPIN can be a helpful device which is not exclusively applicable to the HFT world. © 2012 Asociación Española de Finanzas.","Adverse selection; High frequency trading (HFT); Market microstructure; Order flow toxicity; PIN; Probability of informed trading; VPIN",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84872388245

This is a major application area for artificial intelligence and autonomous agents, yet there have been very few controlled laboratory experiments studying the interactions between human and software-agent traders. In this paper we report on results from new human-agent experiments using the OpEx experimental economics system first introduced at ICAART-2011. Experiments explore the extent to which the performance of the traders, and of the market overall, is dependent on the speed at which the agents operate. Surprisingly, we found that slowing down the agents increased the markets overall ability to settle to a competitive equilibrium, and that slow-agent markets were more efficient.","Algorithmic trading; Auctions; Computational finance; Financial markets; HFT; High-frequency trading; Human-agent experiments; OpEx; Software agents","Algorithmic trading; Auctions; Computational finance; Financial market; HFT; High frequency HF; OpEx; Artificial intelligence; Autonomous agents; Experiments; Finance; Software agents; Commerce",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84862171861

We also consider the slower trader's response to the presence of a fast trader in a market, and the effects of the introduction of a 'Tobin tax' on financial transactions.

The resulting fine-grained measurement demands cannot be met effectively by existing technologies, such as SNMP, NetFlow, or active probing. We propose instrumenting routers with a hash-based primitive that we call a Lossy Difference Aggregator (LDA) to measure latencies down to tens of microseconds even in the presence of packet loss. Because LDA does not modify or encapsulate the packet, it can be deployed incrementally without changes along the forwarding path. When compared to Poisson-spaced active probing with similar overheads, our LDA mechanism delivers orders of magnitude smaller relative error; active probing requires 50-60 times as much bandwidth to deliver similar levels of accuracy. Although ubiquitous deployment is ultimately desired, it may be hard to achieve in the shorter term; we discuss a partial deployment architecture called mPlane using LDAs for intrarouter measurements and localized segment measurements for interrouter measurements. © 2012 IEEE.","Communication technology; computer networks; coordinated streaming; latency measurement; router","Active probing; Automated trading; Communication technologies; End-to-end latency; High-performance computing; M-plane; NetFlows; Network applications; Orders of magnitude; Partial deployment; Relative errors; Computer networks; Computer software selection and evaluation; Routers",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84862521428

This approach takes advantage of boosting's feature selection capability to select an optimal combination of technical indicators and design a new set of trading rules. We tested this approach with high-frequency data of the Dow Jones EURO STOXX 50 Index Futures (FESX) and the DAX Futures (FDAX) for March 2009. Our method was implemented with different learning algorithms and outperformed a combination of the same group of technical analysis indicators using the parameters typically recommended by practitioners. We incorporated this method of model calibration in a trading agent that relies on a layered structure consisting of the machine learning algorithm described above, an online learning utility, a trading strategy, and a risk management overlay. The online learning layer combines the output of several experts and suggests a short or long position. If the expected position is positive (negative), the trading agent sends a buy (sell) limit order at prices slightly lower (higher) than the bid price at the top of the buy (sell) order book less (plus) transaction costs. If the order is not 100% filled within a fixed period (i.e. 1 minute) of being issued, the existent limit orders are cancelled, and limit orders are reissued according to the new experts' forecast. As part of its risk management capability, the trading agent eliminates any weak trading signal. The trading agent algorithm generated positive returns for the two major European index futures (FESX and FDAX) and outperformed a buy-and-hold strategy. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","Agent based economics; Algorithmic trading; Automated trading; Boosting; Machine learning; Trading agents",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84859626085

High-frequency trading data arrive at random times. By combining stochastic and agent-based approaches, we develop a model for trading time, trading volume, and price changes. We generate intertrade time (time between successive trades) Δ ti, and the number of shares traded q(Δ ti) as two independent but power-law autocorrelated processes, where Δ ti is subordinated to q(Δ ti), and Δ ti is more strongly correlated than q(Δ ti). These two power-law autocorrelated processes are responsible for the emergence of strong power-law correlations in (a) the total number of shares traded N(ΔT) and (b) the share volume Q ΔT calculated as the sum of the number of shares q i traded in a fixed time interval ΔT. We find that even though q(Δ ti) is weakly power-law correlated, due to strong power-law correlations in Δ ti, the (integrated) share volume Q(ΔT) ≡Σ ΔT i=1q(Δt i) exhibits strong long-range power-law correlations. We propose that intertrade times and bid-ask price changes share the same volatility mechanism, yielding the power-law autocorrelations in absolute values of price change and power-law tails in the distribution of price changes. The model generates the log-linear functional relationship between the average bid-ask spread 〈S〉 ΔT and the number of trade occurrences N ΔT, and between 〈S〉 ΔT and Q ΔT. We find that both results agree with empirical findings. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","Fractionally integrated processes; High-frequency data; Subordinated processes",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84859615485

We can compute various quantities of interest without resorting to simulation, conditional on the state of the order book, such as the probability that the next move of the mid-price will be upward, or the probability, as a function of order size, that a limit ask order will be executed before a downward move in the mid-price.

Given the greater information content of the order book, over simple price information, it might naturally be expected that the order book would dominate. Using Dollar Sterling tick data, we find that despite the in-sample statistical significance of variables describing the structure of the limit order book in explaining tick-by-tick returns, they do not consistently add significant economic value out-of-sample. We show this using a simple linear model to determine trading activity, as well as a model-free genetic algorithm based on price, order flow, and order book information.

The method is tested on FOREX data series and achieved a considerable profit on the mid price. In the presence of the bid-ask spread, the gain is smaller but it still ranges in the interval 2-6 percent in 6 months without using any leverage.

The second half of the paper applies the taxonomy to ETFs and HFT, thus allowing for a better understanding of the risks posed by ETFs and HFT. We explore these risks with examples and in the context of current efforts to reform financial regulation following the 2007-2008 'credit crunch'.

The remaining inefficiency is usually measured as the ratio of expected P&L, derived from the price signals, to its standard deviation. Such signals are also termed alpha in market slang. Signals and their volatility depend on time in a different manner, leading to temporal diversification and rise of multi-step strategies. It is shown that the coexistence of small market inefficiencies, multi-step strategies, and market impact lead to price randomization. In other words, high-frequency strategies redefine prices in their attempt to amplify weak price signals, and make markets more effective. In this paper we identify and explore discrete and continuous strategies. We further demonstrate that strategies within the domain of weak inefficiency are stable when incorporated into regular risk-return framework.

In this paper, we present viewlet transforms, a recursive finite differencing technique applied to queries. The viewlet transform materializes a query and a set of its higher-order deltas as views. These views support each other's incremental maintenance, leading to a reduced overall view maintenance cost. The viewlet transform of a query admits efficient evaluation, the elimination of certain expensive query operations, and aggressive parallelization. We develop viewlet transforms into a workable query execution technique, present a heuristic and cost-based optimization framework, and report on experiments with a prototype dynamic data management system that combines viewlet transforms with an optimizing compilation technique.

But nowhere in this definition does it explain the significant role that these three mediums, Computational Intelligence and Financial Engineering and Economics, play in the various financial communities and in our professional lives. CIFEr has been a means of exploration for us and many other professionals who work in a financial arena. We need leading edge Financial Engineers now more then ever to work with ""a new"" set of ""basics"" which have evolved recently. Our subprime/liquidity crisis and flash crashes has affected us globally. Program and Algorithmic Trading will continue to grow while changing the way Traders trade and Trade Support supports. The bar has been raised with Regulatory and Compliance and Risk Management. The new rules will not work with the old processes.

A multi-period portfolio optimization model is proposed that incorporates permanent and temporary market impact costs, and alpha decay. There are five popular algorithmic trading strategies that include arrival price, market-on-close, participation, time-weighted average price (TWAP), and volumeweighted average price (VWAP). For a VWAP benchmark, the lowest risk execution is obtained by trading one's own shares in the same fractional volume pattern as the market. VWAP execution is expected to result in the lowest temporary market impact costs. The temporary market impact in a rate of trading model is a function of one's own rate of trading expressed as a fraction of the absolute trading activity of the market. One popular interpretation of the model is that the markets are relatively efficient with respect to the relationship between trading volume and volatility, which are typical inputs of the model. Any reduction in impact that results from more trading volume would be offset by an increase in impact due to increased volatility. The lowest absolute rate of trading can be realized by distributing one's orders evenly over time. This is called a time-weighted average price (TWAP) execution. © Oxford University Press 2012.

There are three approaches that are employed for hedge fund replication. The first method, factor replication, is a top-down approach, which tries to estimate asset exposures of hedge funds with various statistical methods. The second is a bottom-up approach, which is referred here to as rule-based replication. The article aims to isolate broad and fundamental characteristics of hedge fund strategies and implement these with automated trading algorithms. The third approach aims to replicate desirable distributional properties of hedge fund returns with dynamic trading techniques. The underlying assumption of factor replication method is that major parts of hedge fund returns can be captured by a set of common risk factors. The dynamic trading approach aims to match the distributional properties such as mean, volatility, and correlation of hedge fund return time-series relative to a portfolio of common assets. The return time-series of hedge funds are not expected to be replicated on a monthly basis. The implementation of dynamic trading involves three steps. Firstly, the investor's portfolio is used to functionally define desirable dependence structures relative to hedge fund returns. The second step is to derive the payoff function, where the reserve asset is the dependent variable, which will give the dependence structure relative to the investor's portfolio. The final and third step is to derive the dynamic trading strategy, which replicates the payoff function. © Oxford University Press 2012.

A new trade algorithm for the Chinese market was thus proposed. The algorithm first builds an ACD (autoregressive conditional duration) model with asymmetry effect to get a predictive transaction duration time series, then it obtains the trading volume with a new multi-interval VWAP (volume weight average price) algorithm, and finally modifies the trading volume and trust prices based on the stock price prediction model.

We confirm earlier results that large trades, which qualify as shocks for the purpose of this analysis, are timed as they occur when liquidity in the market is extraordinarily high. Moreover, we find that adverse liquidity effects peak within the first-minute interval after a large trade. In contrast to previous researchers' results, we discover that liquidity recovers not within minutes, but within a few seconds so that the adverse effect already diminishes significantly towards the end of the first post-event minute. Three minutes later, basically no residue from the liquidity shock remains observable. We attribute this finding to the fact that temporary order-book imbalances are immediately detected by algorithmic trading engines and high-frequency traders whose order management (IT-) systems are continuously eagle-eying the stock markets for such opportunities.

In this study, the main aim is to investigate the influence of different transition variables, in multiple RSRRL settings and for various datasets, and compare and contrast the performance levels of the RRL and RSRRL systems in algorithmic trading experiments. The transition variables considered are GARCH-based volatility, detrended volume, and the rate of information arrival, the latter being modelled on the Mixture Distribution Hypothesis (MDH). A frictionless setting was assumed for all the experiments. The results showed that the RSRRL models yield higher Sharpe ratios than the standard RRL in-sample, but struggle to reproduce the same performance levels out-of-sample. We argue that the lack of in- and out-of-sample correlation is due to a drastic change in market conditions, and find that the RSRRL can consistently outperform the RRL only when certain conditions are present. We also find that trading volume presents a lot of promise as an indicator, and could be the way forward for the design of more sophisticated RSRRL systems. © 2011 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-81355142015

The purpose of our work is to show that it is possible to automatize thoroughly commodities' trading in the futures market by replacing human traders with artificial agents. As a starting step, we designed a market institution, called producer-consumer, where only an automated seller and an automated buyer can trade on behalf of the producer and consumer, respectively. The producer and consumer periodically feed their trading agents with supply and demand (S&D) forecasts. We suggested a parameterizable trading strategy, called bands and frequencies, for the agents. To measure the overall efficiency of this trading system in terms of price stability and liquidity, we made some hypotheses on the benchmark price curve and its linkages to S&D curves and other relevant market variables. Then we proposed analytical tools to measure strategy performance. Finally, we conducted some computer simulations to prove the workability of this approach. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

IBM found that two software-agent strategies, known as GD and ZIP, consistently outperformed human traders. IBM 's results received international press coverage, probably because the CDA is the mechanism that is used in the main electronic trading systems that make up the global financial markets. In 2002, Tesauro & Bredin published details of an extension to GD, which they named GDX, for which they wrote: ""We suggest that this algorithm may offer the best performance of any published CDA bidding strategy"". To the best of our knowledge, GDX has never been tested against human traders under experimental conditions.

In this paper, we study the profitability of market making strategies in a variety of timeseries models for the evolution of a stock's price. We first provide a precise theoretical characterization of the profitability of a simple and natural market making algorithm in the absence of any stochastic assumptions on price evolution. This characterization exhibits a trade-off between the positive effect of local price fluctuations and the negative effect of net price change. We then use this general characterization to prove that market making is generally profitable on mean reverting time series - - time series with a tendency to revert to a long-term average. Mean reversion has been empirically observed in many markets, especially foreign exchange and commodities. We show that the slightest mean reversion yields positive expected profit, and also obtain stronger profit guarantees for a canonical stochastic mean reverting process, known as the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process, as well as other stochastic mean reverting series studied in the finance literature. We also show that market making remains profitable in expectation for the OU process even if some realistic restrictions on trading frequency are placed on the market maker. © 2011 ACM.","algorithmic trading; computational finance; market making; mean reversion","Algorithmic trading; Computational finance; Expected profits; Foreign exchange; Local prices; market making; Market-maker; Mean reversion; Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process; Positive effects; Price changes; Price evolution; Time series models; Trading strategies; Algorithms; Characterization; Costs; Electronic commerce; Stochastic systems; Time series; Profitability",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-79959580777

Hence, volatility modeling and forecasting is imperative to financial market investors, as such projections allow the investors to adjust their trading strategies in anticipation of the impending financial market movements. Following this, financial volatility trading is the capitalization of the uncertainties of the financial markets to realize investment profits in times of rising, falling and side-way market conditions. In this paper, an intelligent straddle trading system (framework) that consists of a volatility projection module (VPM) and a trade decision module (TDM) is proposed for financial volatility trading via the buying and selling of option straddles to help a human trader capitalizes on the underlying uncertainties of the Hong Kong stock market. Three different measures, namely: (1) the historical volatility (HV), (2) implied volatility (IV) and (3) model-based volatility (MV) of the Hang Seng Index (HSI) are employed to quantify the implicit volatility of the Hong Kong stock market. The TDM of the proposed straddle trading system combines the respective volatility measures with the well-established moving-averages convergence/divergence (MACD) principle to recommend trading actions to a human trader dealing in HSI straddles. However, the inherent limitation of the MACD trading rule is that it generates time-delayed trading signals due to the use of moving averages, which are essentially lagging trend indicators. This drawback is intuitively addressed in the proposed straddle trading system by applying the VPM to compute future projections of the volatility measures of the HSI prior to the activation of the TDM. The VPM is realized by a self-organising neural-fuzzy semantic network named the evolving fuzzy semantic memory (eFSM) model. As compared to existing statistical and computational intelligence based modeling techniques currently employed for financial volatility modeling and forecasting, eFSM possesses several desirable attributes such as: (1) an evolvable knowledge base to continuously address the non-stationary characteristics of the Hong Kong stock market; (2) highly formalized human-like information computations; and (3) a transparent structure that can be interpreted via a set of linguistic IF-THEN semantic fuzzy rules. These qualities provide added credence to the computed HSI volatility projections. The volatility modeling and forecasting performances of the eFSM, when benchmarked to several established modeling techniques, as well as the observed trading returns of the proposed straddle trading system, are encouraging. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

It dynamically determines the periods for momentum and moving averages using the RL paradigm and also appropriately shifting the cycle using ANFIS-RL to address the delay in the predicted cycle. This is used as a proxy to determine the best point in time to go LONG and visa versa for SHORT. When this is coupled with a group of stocks, we derive a simple form of ""riding the cycles - waves"". These are the derived features of the underlying stock movement. It provides a learning framework to trade on cycles. Initial experimental results are encouraging.

Increasing automation and the entry of new trading platforms have resulted in intense competition among trading platforms. Despite these changes, traders still face the same challenges as before. They seek to minimize the total cost of trading, including commissions, bid/ask spreads, and market impact. New technologies allow traders to implement traditional strategies more effectively. For example, dark pools and indications of interest are just an updated form of tactics that NYSE (New York Stock Exchange) floor traders used to search for counterparties while minimizing the exposure of their clients' trading interest to prevent front running. Virtually every measurable dimension of US equity market quality has improved. Execution speeds and retail commissions have fallen. Bid-ask spreads have fallen and remain low, although they spiked upward along with volatility during the recent financial crisis. Market depth has increased. Studies of institutional transactions costs find US costs among the lowest in the world. Unlike during the Crash of 1987, the US equity market mechanism handled the increase in trading volume and volatility without disruption. However, our markets lack a market-wide risk management system that would deal with computer-generated chaos in real time, and our regulators should address this. 'Make or take' pricing, the charging of access fees to market orders that 'take' liquidity and paying rebates to limit orders that 'make' liquidity, causes distortions that should be corrected. Such charges are not reflected in the quotations used for the measurement of best execution. Direct access by nonbrokers to trading platforms requires appropriate risk management. Front running orders in correlated securities should be banned. © 2011 World Scientific Publishing Company and Midwest Finance Association.","bid-ask spreads; Equity markets; high frequency trading; make-or-take pricing; market quality; stock exchanges",,Review,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85073318484

The modified Fuzzy Rule-Based Trading Agent has to decide whether to buy or sell goods, based on the spot and futures time series, gaining a profit from the price speculation. The proposal consists first in changing the membership functions of the fuzzy inference model (Gaussian and Sigmoidal, instead of triangular and trapezoidal). Then using the NFAR (Neuro-Fuzzy Autoregressive) model the relevant lags of the time series are detected, and finally a fuzzy inference system (Self-Organizing Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System) is implemented to aid the decision making process of the agent.

In this article, I draw on ethnographic fieldwork in order to open these black boxes, while trying to describe their existence as devices encapsulating several points of views. I address the question of a possible misalignment between those visions, and more specifically try to draw the consequences raised by such discrepancies as regards the future of financial regulation. © 2011, SAGE, Los Angeles, London, New Delhi, and Singapore.

To deal with high throughput and low response time requirements, these EP systems mainly use the CPU-RAM sub-system for data processing. However, as we show here, collected statistics on CPU usage or on CPU-RAM communication reveal that available systems are poorly optimized and grossly waste resources. In this paper we quantify some of these inefficiencies and propose cache-aware algorithms and changes on internal data structures to overcome them. We test the before and after system both at the microarchitecture and application level and show that: i) the changes improve microarchitecture metrics such as clocks-per-instruction, cache misses or TLB misses; ii) and that some of these improvements result in very high application level improvements such as a 44% improvement on stream-to-table joins with 6-fold reduction on memory consumption, and order-of-magnitude increase on throughput for moving aggregation operations. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.","Benchmarking; Complex Event Processing; Performance; Tuning","Computer architecture; Data handling; Random access storage; Supply chain management; Tuning; Aggregation operation; Algorithmic trading; Complex event processing; Critical applications; Memory consumption; Micro architectures; Performance; Production monitoring; Benchmarking",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-79952023562

In fact, some initiatives could be observed in recent years, for instance [1] and [2]. In this paper, we present a multiagent system composed by several autonomous analysts that use fundamentalist information in their reasoning process. These fundamentalist information are composed by company profit, dividends, data related to the company economic sector among others. This kind of information is rarely used on autonomous trading, because most of the agents deal only with technical information, which is composed by price and volume time series. Furthermore, we do not find a open source stock market simulator with support to fundamentalist trader agents. We then created a significantly extended version of the open source financial market simulation tool, called AgEx. This designed version provides also fundamentalist information about the trader's assets. As well as, makes more efficient the exchange of messages within AgEx. This efficiency allows traders that may submit orders in very short intervals of just some seconds or even some fraction of second, to use AgEx as a test platform. Using this new version of AgEx, we implemented and tested the multiagent system based on fundamentalist agents, that we call FAS.

The literature contains many proposals for calculating a social welfare but the Nash welfare seems to be the one which has the most interesting properties for a fair agent society. It guarantees that all resources are fairly distributed among agents respecting their own preferences. This article shows first that the computation of this welfare is a difficult problem, contrary to common intuition. Many counter-examples describe the pitfalls of this resolution.

Deriving optimal execution strategies that minimize transaction costs, automated trading engines need to forecast future liquidity levels. By means of an empirical study we provide evidence that the publication of regulatory corporate disclosures is followed by abnormal liquidity levels. As we do not find abnormal liquidity levels prior to the publication, we assume the content to be largely unanticipated. Forecasting models purely based on quantitative input data may therefore not be able to pick up on the liquidity trends in a timely manner. Against this background, we propose two trading signals that allow automated trading engines to appropriately react to news-related liquidity shocks: First, a simple binary ""news"" or ""no news"" signal. Second, a signal that indicates whether or not the publication of a regulatory corporate disclosure will be followed by a negative liquidity shock. Utilizing text mining techniques, the content of the corporate disclosures is analyzed to extract the trading signal. The trading signals are evaluated within a simulation-based use case and turn out to be valuable. We strongly advise developers of automated trading engines to integrate unstructured qualitative data into their models, i.e. the proposed trading signals.","And simulation; Automated trading; E-finance; Forecasting; Liquidity; Text mining","And simulation; Automated trading; E-finance; Liquidity; Text mining; Automation; Data mining; Forecasting; Information systems; Publishing; Signal processing; Commerce",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84870629618

In algorithmic high frequency trading, for instance, stock price thresholds that are of interest to a trader change rapidly, and gains directly hinge on the reaction time to relevant fluctuations. The common solution to adapt a subscription consists of a re-subscription, where a new subscription is issued and the superseded one canceled. This is ineffective, leading to missed or duplicate events during the transition. In this paper, we introduce the concept of parametric subscriptions to support subscription adaptations. We propose novel algorithms for updating routing mechanisms effectively and efficiently in classic CPS broker overlay networks. Compared to re-subscriptions, our algorithms significantly improve the reaction time to subscription updates and can sustain higher throughput in the presence of high update rates. We convey our claims through implementations of our algorithms in two CPS systems, and by evaluating them on two different real-world applications. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2010.",,"Content-based publish; High frequency; Novel algorithm; Reaction time; Real-world application; Relevant fluctuations; Routing mechanism; Stock price; Content-based publish; High-frequency trading; Novel algorithm; Real-world; Relevant fluctuations; Routing mechanism; Stock price; Middleware; Overlay networks; Reaction rates; Commerce; Middleware; Overlay networks; Reaction rates; Algorithms; Algorithms",Conference Paper,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-79956325827

Network operators today lack sufficient fine-grain measurement tools to detect, localize and repair performance anomalies and delay spikes that cause application SLA violations. A recently proposed solution called LDA provides a scalable way to obtain latency, but only provides aggregate measurements. However, debugging application-specific problems requires per-flow measurements, since different flows may exhibit significantly different characteristics even when they are traversing the same link. To enable fine-grained per-flow measurements in routers, we propose a new scalable architecture called reference latency interpolation (RLI) that is based on our observation that packets potentially belonging to different flows that are closely spaced to each other exhibit similar delay properties. In our evaluation using simulations over real traces, we show that RLI achieves a median relative error of 12% and one to two orders of magnitude higher accuracy than previous per-flow measurement solutions with small overhead.

To that purpose a methodology has been defined, based on the design of a genetic algorithm GAP and an incremental training technique adapted to the learning of series of stock market values. The GAP technique consists in a fusion of GP and GA. In GAP a chromosome is composed of a tree with language operators and a vector with numeric values. The GAP algorithm implements the automatic search for trading rules taking as objectives of the training both the optimization of the return obtained and the minimization of the assumed risk. In order to diminish high over-fitting, a technique of incremental training has been used. Applying the proposed methodology, rules have been obtained for a period of eight years of the S&P500 index. The achieved adjustment of the relation return-risk has generated rules with returns very superior in the testing period to those obtained applying habitual methodologies and even clearly superior to Buy&Hold.

Alternating decision tree (ADT), which is implemented with Logitboost, was chosen as the underlying algorithm. One of the strengths of our approach is that the algorithm is able to select the best combination of rules derived from well-known technical analysis indicators and is also able to select the best parameters of the technical indicators. Additionally, the online learning layer combines the output of several ADTs and suggests a short or long position. Finally, the risk management layer can validate the trading signal when it exceeds a specified non-zero threshold and limit the application of our trading strategy when it is not profitable. We test the expert weighting algorithm with data of 100 randomly selected companies of the S & P 500 index during the period 2003-2005. We find that this algorithm generates abnormal returns during the test period.

In addition, it compares whether volatility level and volatility persistence before and after the introduction of the automated trading system differs in FCPO market. The study covers the period from January, 2000 until December 2006. Findings reveal that the volatility persistence is marginally higher under the automated trading system relative to the open outcry system for the FCPO market; asymmetric volatility parameters for the spot market are insignificant for both pre-and post-auto periods.

Under this approach to wealth maximization, automated trading focuses on the process determining directional trades for individual securities based upon the receipt and interpretation of new data. This paper presents a stochastic price formation algorithm that implements a cognitive decision making system modeled by twin radial basis function artificial neural networks to produce a high frequency automated trading system for individual equity securities listed on U.S. exchanges. The overall effectiveness and efficiency of the automated trading system is calibrated by estimating non-parametric quasi elasticity coefficients for individual firm fundamental characteristics. We find that automation driven by cognitive science can effectively auto-trade securities and produce changes to individual wealth that equals or exceeds the performance generated by a simple buy-and-hold strategy. We also identify four fundamental firm factors that explain the ability of the automated trading algorithm to produce a measured level of percent-positive trades. © Izmir University of Economics, Turkey, 2010.","Artificial neural networks; Automated trading; Cognitive science; Stochastic models","Algorithms; Automation; Neural networks; Optimization; Radial basis function networks; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Automated trading; Automated trading systems; Cognitive decision makings; Cognitive science; Elasticity coefficients; Fundamental characteristics; Multicriteria decision; Radial basis function artificial neural networks; Commerce",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84905453251

The proposal consists first in changing the membership functions of the fuzzy inference model (gaussian and sigmoidal, instead of triangular and trapezoidal). Then using the NFAR (Neuro-Fuzzy Autorregresive) model the relevant lags of the time series are detected, and finally a fuzzy inference system (Self-Organizing Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System) is implemented to aid the decision making process of the agent.

An initial look at financial time series gives the impression that they are random in nature. If true, this would make the forecast, and therefore the trading, of such series exceptionally difficult. The efficient market hypothesis states that the current price contains all available information in the market. This leads to the predictability of most financial time series as being a rather controversial issue. Experts have been forecasting and trading financial markets for decades, using their knowledge and expertise in recognizing patterns and interpreting current financial data. This paper extends the Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System to create an expert system that is capable of using fuzzy reasoning combined with the pattern recognition capability of neural networks to be used in financial forecasting and trading. The novelty of the approach lies in its application to the field of high frequency finance. Such an approach has not been used so far with high frequency trading or as a part of an automated trading strategy. This has produced an expert trading system which overcomes the physical limitations of human experts and traders in taking multiple decisions at extremely short time intervals. This means the system can perform predictions and trading decisions at a very high frequency using intra-day data. © 2009 IEEE.","Efficient market hypothesis; Financial prediction; High frequency trading; Neuro-fuzzy inference system","Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system; Automated trading; Efficient market hypothesis; Financial data; Financial forecasting; Financial market; Financial prediction; Financial time series; Financial trading; Fuzzy reasoning; High frequency; High-frequency finance; Human expert; Neuro-fuzzy inference systems; Physical limitations; Short time intervals; Trading systems; Very high frequency; Computer aided engineering; Expert systems; Finance; Financial data processing; Forecasting; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy neural networks; Fuzzy systems; Pattern recognition systems; Time series; Commerce",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-77949509317

It is a complex burden for both users and providers to assess their true valuation for a certain combination of resources and services and to efficiently communicate this valuation to the market. This paper contributes to the theory of designing distributed allocation models in that (i) we propose a model for preference elicitation, which allows users and providers to assess their valuations as a function of their resource requirements and strategic considerations, (ii) we show how this model can be encoded within so-called bidding agents which interact with the market on behalf of the user, and (iii) we evaluate our approach in a numerical experiment to illustrate how the bidding agent adapts to the dynamic market situation.

Though useful, these electronic markets are far from being believable trading places. Marketplace is where things and traders have presence, constituting a rich interaction space. The believability of the place depends on the believability of the presence and interactions in it, including the players' behaviour and the narrative scenarios of the marketplace. This paper discusses what constitutes the believability of electronic marketplaces and presents the technologies that support it. Believability of electronic marketplaces can be described through three metaphors: ""marketplaces where people are"", ""market-places that are alive and engaging"", and ""market places where information is valuable and useful"". The paper presents the core technologies that enable the perceivable believability of electronic marketplaces. It describes a demonstrable prototype of a Web-based electronic marketplace that integrates these technologies.

Algorithmic trading, network monitoring and sensor networks are good examples of applications that rely upon ESP systems. As these systems become larger and more widely deployed, they have to answer increasingly stronger requirements that are often difficult to satisfy. Fault-tolerance is a good example of such a nontrivial requirement. Making ESP operators fault-tolerant can add considerable performance overhead to the application. In this paper, we focus on active replication as an approach to provide fault-tolerance to ESP operators. More precisely, we address the performance costs of active replication for operators in distributed ESP applications. We use a speculation mechanism based on Software Transactional Memory (STM) to achieve the following goals: (i) enable replicas to make progress using optimistic delivery; (ii) enable early forwarding of speculative computation results; (iii) enable active replication of multi-threaded operators using transactional executions. Experimental evaluation shows that, using this combination of mechanisms, one can implement highly efficient fault-tolerant ESP operators. © 2009 IEEE.",,"Active replication; Algorithmic trading; Event streams; Experimental evaluation; Fault-tolerant; Monitoring applications; Multi-threading; Multithreaded; Network Monitoring; Performance costs; Software transactional memory; Speculative computation; Fault tolerance; Hydraulics; Multitasking; Quality assurance",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-74949095499

The resulting fine-grain measurement demands cannot be met effectively by existing technologies, such as SNMP, NetFlow, or active probing. We propose instrumenting routers with a hash-based primitive that we call a Lossy Difference Aggregator (LDA) to measure latencies down to tens of microseconds and losses as infrequent as one in a million. Such measurement can be viewed abstractly as what we refer to as a coordinated streaming problem, which is fundamentally harder than standard streaming problems due to the need to coordinate values between nodes. We describe a compact data structure that efficiently computes the average and standard deviation of latency and loss rate in a coordinated streaming environment. Our theoretical results translate to an efficient hardware implementation at 40 Gbps using less than 1% of a typical 65-nm 400-MHz networking ASIC. When compared to Poisson-spaced active probing with similar overheads, our LDA mechanism delivers orders of magnitude smaller relative error; active probing requires 50-60 times as much bandwidth to deliver similar levels of accuracy.

However, in order to eliminate unnecessary input in the training phase a new event based volatility model was proposed. Taking volatility and the scaling laws of financial time series into consideration has brought about the development of the Intraday Seasonality Observation Model. This new model allows the observation of specific events and seasonalities in data and subsequently removes any unnecessary data.

The theoretical justification of the algorithm is the short-term behaviour of the index as an oscillation with predictable frequency. The economic interpretation of this behaviour relates to the overshooting and mean reversion properties of the financial time series. The algorithm is applied to the two main Euronext indices, sc. the AEX index and the CAC40 index. The algorithm outperforms the buy and hold investment strategy considerably in both cases. © 2009 Palgrave Macmillan.","Algorithmic trading; Asset management; Financial time series modelling",,Review,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-67650245127

Previous papers have shown that values of the eight parameters governing behavior of ZIP traders can be automatically optimized using a genetic algorithm (GA), and that markets populated by GA-optimized traders perform better than those populated by ZIP traders with manually set parameter values. This paper introduces a more sophisticated version of the ZIP algorithm, called ""ZIP60,"" which requires the values of 60 parameters to be set correctly. ZIP60 is shown here to produce significantly better results in comparison to the original ZIP algorithm (called ""ZIP8"" hereafter) when a GA is used to search the 60-dimensional parameter space. It is also demonstrated here that this works best when the GA itself has control over the dimensionality of the search-space, allowing evolution to guide the expansion of the search-space up from 8 parameters to 60 via intermediate steps. Principal component analysis of the best evolved ZIP60 parameter-sets establishes that no ZIP8 solutions are embedded in the 60-dimensional space. Moreover, some of the results and analysis presented here cast doubt on previously published ZIP8 results concerning the evolution of new ""hybrid"" auction mechanisms that appeared to be improvements on the CDA: it now seems likely that those results were actually consequences of the relative lack of sophistication in the original ZIP8 algorithm, because ""hybrid"" mechanisms occur much less frequently when ZIP60s are used. © 2008 IEEE.","Adaptive trader-agents; Algorithmic trading; Automated market mechanism design; Genetic algorithms (GAs); ZIP traders","Algorithms; Automation; Commerce; Electronic commerce; Genetic algorithms; Machine design; Marketing; Principal component analysis; Adaptive trader-agents; Algorithmic trading; Automated market mechanism design; Genetic algorithms (GAs); ZIP traders; Adaptive algorithms",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-59749084372

Even though some strategies have been proposed by researchers, most of them can only work within a static negotiation environment. In this paper, we present a model for designing a strategy for agents that makes adjustable rates of concession by negotiating according to the changes of environments with uncertain and dynamic outside options. This proposal is based on the market-driven agents (MDAs) model, and is guided by four factors in order to determine the degree of concession. These factors are trading opportunity, trading competition, trading time and strategy, and eagerness. The contribution of this paper is extending the MDAs model to an open and dynamic negotiation environment by considering both the current and potential changes of the environment. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The challenge of trading large order volumes and baskets is often met today with automated trading algorithms. An investment decision generally leads to orders with specifications such as security, size, and urgency but also specifications (e.g., expected profit), and constraints (e.g., dollar neutrality) may be given. The trader has to choose a trading strategy ensuring best execution under given marginal constraints. This review provides an overview of how such trading algorithms work. The ideas behind some standard strategies are presented, as well as approaches to enhance them. For developing automated trading strategies for stock markets, a deep understanding in market microstructure is necessary, so we review this topic as well. We have a look on the issue how market quality is affected by market designs of trading platforms and fragmentation of the market. Trading costs are the main attribute of market quality. Trading strategies are implemented to optimize trading costs and execution risk by taking market microstructure aspects into account. Empirical analyses of trading volume and order book characteristics help to adjust the trading strategies. © Jan Fraenkle, Svetlozar T.

Examples of streaming applications include security agencies processing data from communications media, battlefield management systems for military operations, consumer fraud detection based on on- line transactions, and automated trading based on finan- cial market data. Many stream processing applications are faced with the challenge of increasingly large volumes of data and the requirement to deliver low-latency responses predicated by analysis of that data. In this paper, we assess the applicability of the Blue Gene architecture for stream computing applications. This work is part of a larger effort to demonstrate the efficacy of using a Blue Gene for stream- ing applications. Blue Gene supercomputers provide a high-bandwidth low-latency network connecting a set of I/O and compute nodes. We examine Blue Gene's suitability for stream com- puting applications by assessing its messaging capability for typical stream computing messaging workloads. In par- ticular, this paper presents results from micro-benchmarks we used to evaluate the raw performance of Blue Gene/P (Blue Gene/P) supercomputer under loads produced by high volumes of streaming data. We measure the perfor- mance of data streams that originate outside the supercom- puter, are directed through the I/O nodes to the compute nodes and then terminate outside. Our performance experi- ments demonstrate that the Blue Gene/P hardware delivers low-latency and high-throughput capability in a manner us- able by streaming applications. © 2008 IEEE.",,"Benchmarking; Computers; Military applications; Military data processing; Real time systems; Supercomputers; Wireless sensor networks; Automated trading; Battlefield management systems; Blue genes; Communications medias; Data streams; Fraud detections; High bandwidths; High throughputs; Low latencies; Low-latency networks; Market datum; On-line transactions; Real-time datum; Security agencies; Stream computing; Stream processing; Stream processing systems; Streaming applications; Streaming datum; Security of data",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-62949112645

In real-time applications with streaming data two major issues that need particular care are the inefficiency of batch-mode learning, and the arduous task of training the learning machine in presence of non-stationary behavior. We tackle these issues in the context of algorithmic trading, where sequential decisions need to be made quickly as new data points arrive, and where the data generating process may change continuously with time. We propose a master algorithm that evolves a pool of on-line SVR experts and learns to trade by dynamically weighting the experts' opinions.

Second, the integration of TTF, as it is said to exhibit better results for work-related tasks and thus enables the model to account for the fit between the technology and the given task requirements.

However, the root of this problem is not too much information; rather it is the fact that humans have limited attention spans to handle this information. Humans possess more processing power than computers but computers score over us in having almost unlimited attention spans. We must allocate our attention span in such a way as to maximize the information we obtain, given the constraint of our mental abilities. We have adopted a number of strategies to cope, like using intelligent search agents or spreading what attention we have thinly across as many information sources as possible (in other words skimming). The financial services industry, however, has adopted a radical approach: cut the human out of key parts of information acquisition and processing and use computers instead. This article argues that this approach could well spread to the wider business information market in the next few years. Far from being a threat, this could prove liberating for information professionals, allowing them to become more expert in specific industry sectors. The new breed of industry information portals, or community sites, will greatly aid in this transition and will build professional skills and efficiency.

Although automating the service trading process is a key characteristic of a real-time enterprise, to the best of our knowledge it has not been completely addressed yet. In this article, we propose a conceptual framework for automated service trading. Therefore, our goal is not to implement a concrete architecture but to develop a framework that can be used to define, compare and analyse the interoperability of different service trading architectures. The novel contributions of this paper are threefold: we identify the roles and interactions that are necessary to carry out this automated service trading, we motivate and introduce the idea of trading protocols, and we define the elements that are necessary to support an automated decision-making in service trading. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2008.","Service oriented computing; SLAs; Trading","Automation; Decision making; Electronic commerce; Information services; Interoperability; Network architecture; Outsourcing; Quality of service; Telecommunication services; Automated decision making; Conceptual frameworks; Concrete architecture; Key characteristics; Service Level Agreements; Service oriented computing; SLAs; Trading; Service oriented architecture (SOA)",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85025443733

During the course of each year's competition historical data is logged describing more than 800 games played by different agents from around the world. In this paper, we present analysis that is focused on determining which features of agent behavior, such as the average lead time requested for supplies or the average selling price offered on finished products, tend to differentiate agents that win from those that do not. We present a visual inspection of data from 16 games played in one bracket of the 2006 TAC SCM semi-final rounds. Plots of data from these games help isolate behavioral features that distinguish top performing agents in this bracket. We then introduce a metric based on information gain to provide a more complete analysis of the 80 games played in the 2006 TAC SCM quarter-final, semi-final and final rounds. The metric captures the amount of information that is gained about an agent's performance by knowing its value for each of 20 different behavioral features. Using this metric we find that, in the final rounds of the 2006 competition, winning agents distinguished themselves by their procurement decisions, rather than their customer bidding decisions.

Many researches in the literature tried to overcome this situation by allowing agent to learn its opponent's negotiation strategy or attitude then to adjust its strategy in order to improve the solution. However, they still need to assume that the negotiator has known opponent's partial information, such as attitude and deadline, before negotiation. In order to overcome this difficulty, this study proposes a learning-based negotiation mechanism using genetic algorithm (GA) to learn the opponent's negotiation deadline, attitude, and the reservation value of each issue before the negotiation is settled. In addition, we use negotiation thread and the difference between the joint utility and Pareto-optimal solution as performance indices to demonstrate that the GAbased learning approach can have a better negotiation result.","Genetic algorithm; Learning; Negotiation","Learning; Learning approach; Negotiation; Negotiation mechanism; Negotiation strategy; Pareto optimal solutions; Partial information; Performance indices; Genetic algorithms; Industrial engineering; Optimal systems; Commerce",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84886077335

Through extensive experiments we demonstrate the superiority of providing such agents for humans over supplying equilibrium agents or letting people design their own agents. These results are based on our observation that most people do not modify SC agents even though they are not in equilibrium.

These algorithms are usually referred as technical analysis. However, traders prefer to use a combination of several algorithms as indicators, rather than choosing a single one. The several signals provided are used to determine the trader order to buy or sell some stocks, or even to decide to not submit any order. In the last years, some researchers have tried to create new algorithms with learning skills in order to produce autonomous automatic traders, some of them using AI techniques. Inspired by the human traders' decision processes, our architectural approach composes heterogeneous autonomous trader agents in a competitive multiagent system. This architecture allows the use of several algorithms, based on different technical analysis indexes to manage portfolios. We have implemented this architecture and we have performed a set of simulation experiments using real-data from NASDAQ stock market. The experimental results were compared to the performance of single agents playing alone, and a better global performance was observed when traders compete with each other for resources. These preliminary results indicate that competition among agents, as proposed here, may reach very good results, even among agents created to act alone in this kind of market.","Automated trading; Multiagent architecture; Multiagent systems","AI techniques; Architectural approach; Automated trading; Competitive multi-agent systems; Decision process; Global performance; Learning skills; Multiagent architecture; Simulation experiments; Single-agent; Stock market; Stock price; Technical analysis; Technical analysis indexes; Autonomous agents; Commerce; Electric ship equipment; Information systems; Multi agent systems; Set theory; Learning algorithms",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-65949103073

The twelve leading online investment programs (by trade volume) provide access to U.S. security exchanges only. A second, related problem is the lack of a fully automated investment portal availing itself of new technologies. Many of these technologies are utilized by leading security exchanges. The electronic communications network (ECN) provides a widely used example of important new technology. ECN's allow both institutional and individual investors a network with automatic matching of buy and sell orders, excising any third party. Currently, NASDAQ ECNs handle more than 40% of trade volume, a number expected to increase. These streamlined trades show evidence of reduced fees resulting from lowered transaction costs. Also with ECN's, we see initial signs of increased individual order matching speed. This evidence demonstrates the good chances for developing a global, fully automated trading system. The GoTrade team objective is to develop the initial design, simulate, and conduct analysis of an online trading system that provides global market access to any potential investor with an internet connection. The team plans to design a system that is secure, fully automated, and situated to optimize connectivity to global markets based upon expected user population distributions and current global internet infrastructure. To keep the project manageable, we limit our research to the NASDAQ, London, and Hong Kong Exchanges. We plan to build a model of our system in Arena and test the performance versus cost of various design alternatives. The factors most important to our system are performance and cost. This determination was made after survey elicitation, interviews with online investors, and consultations with our sponsor and technical advisors. The trade-off analysis associated with these measures will aid in determining the final system configuration.",,"Automated trading; Automatic matching; Design alternatives; Electronic communications; Global Internet; Global markets; Hong-kong; Information Engineering; Initial design; International markets; Internet connections; Matching speed; New technologies; On-line investment; Online trading; Population distributions; Single location; System configurations; Technical advisors; Third parties; Trade volume; Trade-off analysis; Transaction costs; Automation; Commerce; Finance; International trade; Internet; Investments; Population statistics; Telecommunication; Technology",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-50249163253

However, the main goal of most investors is the optimization of a risk-adjusted performance measure, such as the well-known Sharpe index. This issue has been approached by a few different studies within the area of Neurocomputing. The present paper briefly describes and empirically compares some of the models and methods proposed in those studies. Such adaptive methods can be computationally demanding, and convergence to high-quality solutions can be difficult to achieve, yet they can be very useful in automated trading systems, namely for portfolio management. In particular, the Q-learning algorithm, when combined with neural networks for value function approximation, seems to be a reasonably competitive approach, although not overall superior to alternative ones. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

It is helpful in estimating risk of an investor's portfolio, arosen from lack of information, uncertainty and incomplete knowledge of reality, which forbids a perfect prediction of future price changes. Despite of many advantages this tool is not known and not widely used among investors on Warsaw Stock Exchange. The main reason for abandoning this method is a high level of complexity and immense calculations. The aim of this paper is to introduce an automatic decision-making system, which allows a single investor to use complex methods of Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT). The key tool in MPT is an analysis of an empirical covariance matrix. This matrix, obtained from historical data, biased by such a high amount of statistical uncertainty, that it can be seen as random. By bringing into practice the ideas of Random Matrix Theory (RMT), the noise is removed or significantly reduced, so the future risk and return are better estimated and controlled. These concepts are applied to the Warsaw Stock Exchange Simulator http://gra.onet.pl.

An existing machine-learning method called recurrent reinforcement learning (RRL) was chosen as the underlying algorithm for ARL. One of the strengths of our approach is that the dynamic optimization layer makes a fixed choice of model tuning parameters unnecessary.

However, due to the simplicity of these rules, each rule is susceptible to poor behavior in specific types of adverse market conditions. Naive combinations of such rules are not very effective in mitigating the weaknesses of component rules. We demonstrate that sophisticated approaches to combining these trading rules enable us to overcome these problems and gainfully utilize them in autonomous agents. We achieve this combination through the use of genetic algorithms and genetic programs. Further, we show that it is possible to use qualitative characterizations of stochastic dynamics to improve the performance of these agents by delineating safe, or feasible, regions. We present the results of experiments conducted within the Penn-Lehman Automated Trading project. In this way we are able to demonstrate that autonomous agents can achieve consistent profitability in a variety of market conditions, in ways that are human competitive.

However, the efficiency and effectiveness of the trading decisions and investment strategies suggested by a computer based system are always being oppugned by researchers for abnegating the specialists' professional intermediary roles in traditional floor trading. Without proper validations, evaluations and comparisons, those valuable decision support systems can hardly be adopted trustily. This paper presents a Web-service-agents-based Securities Trading Simulation System (STSS) as a platform to validate, evaluate and compare the existing securities trading decision support systems by using the real world securities trading data from Chicago Stock Exchange. Agent technology is applied to deal with the complex, dynamic, and distributed securities trading processes. Web-services techniques are proposed for more interoperability and scalability in network-based business environment. By integrating agent technology with Web-services to make use of the advantages of both, this approach provides a more intelligent, flexible, and comprehensive platform to simulate the securities trading process. Performance of different decision support systems for securities trading can be validated, evaluated and compared either separately or simultaneously on a real time basis.","Decision support system; Intelligent agents; Securities trading simulation; Web-services","Agent technology; Automated trading; Business environments; Chicago; Computer-based system; Distributed security; Global trends; Integrating agents; Investment strategy; Network-based; Real time; Securities trading simulation; Simulation systems; Stock exchange; Artificial intelligence; Commerce; Decision making; Decision support systems; Information systems; Intelligent agents; Real time systems; User interfaces; Web services; Interoperability",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-80053486032

So we use the term in a sense that includes the business of e-procurement. Of particular interest are: the selection of trading partners, the development of trading relationships, and the negotiation and execution of contracts in the context of a relationship. The potential value of the e-business market - including e-procurement - is enormous. Given the current state of technical development it is surprising that a comparatively small amount of automated trading is presently deployed.1 The technologies we refer to are first multiagent systems, and second the theory of competitive interaction. As a discipline, multiagent systems dates back to around 1975 when it was referred to as distributed artificial intelligence. The problems of building and deploying autonomous, intelligent agents are far from resolved but the technology has considerable maturity. The theory of competitive interaction, game theory, that principally dates back to the 1920s, has been developed mainly by the microeconomic community, and more recently also by the multiagent systems community in the area of agent-mediated electronic commerce.

It defines the process by which information is transformed into an ontologically stable category of price. Reconstructing this sensemaking is a crucial task, since the settlement of prices for futures markets has significant organizational and economic consequences. And the recent emergence of electronic trading as an alternative to traditional ways of trading makes this issue more vivid. Futures exchanges have historically relied on a trading technology known as ""open outcry,"" where traders gather in a central physical location to buy and sell futures contracts on a range of physical and financial commodities. The organizational practices of open outcry produces prices deeply embedded in the interactions among these traders. Since the early 1990s, the technology of futures trading has been challenged by the introduction of electronic trading platforms. Automated trading systems shift the point of exchange from a centralized physical location to a decentralized network of terminals, located in investment banks and smaller boutique trading firms. With the elimination of the exchange trading floor and transformation of trading technology, the schemas and organizational settings that supported the creation of prices in open outcry have required renegotiation. This paper uses participant observation and interview data gathered on the trading floors of open outcry and electronic exchanges to investigate how sensemaking leads to the production of futures market prices.","Futures markets; Organizational sensemaking; Prices","Costs; Electronic commerce; Electronic trading; Floors; Investments; Automated trading systems; Decentralized networks; Economic consequences; Organizational practices; Organizational setting; Participant observations; Prices; Sensemaking; Financial markets",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85088341257

Automated stock trading draws much interest from both the fields of computer science and of business, since it promises to provide superior ability in a trading market to any individual trader. Trading strategies have been proposed and practiced from the perspectives of Artificial Intelligence, market making, external information feedback, and technical analysis among others. This paper examines two automated stock-trading agents in the context of the Penn-Lehman Automated Trading (PLAT) simulator [1], which is a real-time, real-data market simulator. The first agent devises a market-making strategy exploiting market volatility without predicting the exact direction of the stock price movement. The second agent uses technical analysis. It might seem natural to buy when the market is on the rise and sell when it’s on the decline, but the second agent does exactly the opposite. As a result, we call it the reverse strategy. The strategies used by both agents are adapted for automated trading. Both agents performed well in a PLAT live competition. In this paper, we analyze the performance of these two automated trading strategies.

Starting from recent results proposed in literature, we have conjectured that the Technical Analysis approach could reasonably extract the information present in prices and volumes. Like tool able to find out the relation existing between the Technical Analysis inputs and an output we properly defined, we use the Group Method of Data Handling, a soft-computing approach which gives back a polynomial approximation of the unknown relationship between the inputs and the output. The automatic Trading Strategy we implement is able both to work in real-time and to return operative signals.

Automation of trading systems, led by the continental European exchanges and US 'electronic communications networks' (ECNs), has resulted in significant declines in trading costs, massive increases in turnover, internationalization of trading and settlement system operations, and major reforms in exchange governance. Yet the policy advice given to developing country governments looking to create or expand securitized finance in their markets has been largely unaffected by these developments. This is unfortunate, as developing countries now have the opportunity to leapfrog the evolving infrastructure of the mature markets and to define the global efficient frontier in trading technology, exchange governance, investor access and market structure regulation.

A TAG agent simulates one vision of future travel agents: it represents a set of clients in simultaneous auctions, trading complementary (e.g., airline tickets and hotel reservations) and substitutable (e.g., symphony and theater tickets) goods. RoxyBot faced two key technical challenges in TAG: (i) allocation-assigning purchased goods to clients at the end of a game instance so as to maximize total client utility, and (ii) completion-determining the optimal quantity of each resource to buy and sell given client preferences, current holdings, and market prices. For the dimensions of TAG, an optimal solution to the allocation problem is tractable, and RoxyBot uses a search algorithm based on Az.ast to produce optimal allocations. An optimal solution to the completion problem is also tractable, but in the interest of minimizing bidding cycle time, RoxyBot solves the completion problem using beam search, producing approximately optimal completions. RoxyBot's completer relies on an innovative data structure called a priceline.",,"Data structures; Intelligent agents; Optimal systems; Resource allocation; Software agents; Automated trading agent; Bidding algorithms; Algorithms",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0001509483

Such systems will be com- posed of hundreds or even thousands of autonomous agents. Moreover, in open and dynamic environments, the number of agents in the sys- tem at any one time will uctuate significantly. To cope with these twin issues of scalability and variable numbers, we hypothesize that multi- agent systems need to be both self-building (able to determine the most appropriate organizational structure for the system by themselves at run- time) and adaptive (able to change this structure as their environment changes). To evaluate this hypothesis we have implemented such amulti- agent system and have applied it to the domain of automated trading. Preliminary results supporting the first part of this hypothesis are pre- sented: adaption and self-organization do indeed make the system better able to cope with large numbers of agents. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2001.",,"Autonomous agents; Scalability; Automated trading; Dynamic environments; Environment change; One-time; Organizational structures; Runtimes; Self organizations; Variable number; Multi agent systems",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84937392772

Agents are particularly useful in markets where trade might not have been possible otherwise, for example because a lot of information must be processed quickly, or because employing human traders in 24-hour, small transactions markets is not cost-effective. Markets for communication bandwidth, where organisations trade the rights to transmit data over a network, are one such application. Because demand fluctuates considerably every few seconds agent-based spot markets provide extra liquidity. This paper considers the design of agents which automatically trade in a k-double auction market for communication bandwidth. We suggest criteria and a general framework for building adaptive agents based on ideas from statistical decision theory. In particular our agents are designed to differentiate stable from unstable market conditions and to best-respond to these changes.","Electronic commerce; Electronic data submissions; Internet auctions","Automated trading; Communication bandwidth; Electronic markets; Statistical decision theory; Data communication systems; Data processing; Decision theory; Marketing; Societies and institutions; Statistical methods; Bandwidth",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84862442827

The algorithms are compared and contrasted and the deficiencies of some highlighted. The fundamental reasons for the actual success of these algorithms are extracted, and used to suggest where they might most fruitfully be applied.

These changes call for a reevaluation of regulatory regimes. For example, because divergent market structures competing for order flow may fall within different regulatory structures, the proper allocation of regulatory costs should be weighed. Because of the open access by all investors to all markets that technology permits, regulators need to examine the level of oversight necessary to ensure the protection of investors. Because of existing statutory limits, automated systems may pose particular problems in the U.S. regarding the appropriate levels of regulation for non-intermediated trading and cross-border systems that are regulated by an overseas authority. On another topic, automation facilitates increased transparency. In turn, transparency promotes investor protection, encourages market liquidity, and fosters the efficiency of securities markets by facilitating price discovery and open competition, thus reducing the effects of fragmentation. In the end, because it enhances the efficiency of the market's price discovery function and liquidity, transparancy contributes to the efficient allocation of scarce capital among competing demands for that capital.

The A-H pairs trading is an algorithmic trading strategy for A shares and H shares of the same company, which dual lists its stocks on the Shanghai and Hong Kong stock market. It might seem intuitive that the SH-HK Stock Connect helps to eliminate the inefficiency of stock pricing of dual-listed companies, and thus dramatically reduces the profitability of A-H pairs trading.
